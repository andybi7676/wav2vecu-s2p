the horse wrangler is the fellow who goes out and rounds up the ponies
the cowsll sleep themselves out of sight before you get there if you dont get a move on
in a few moments they too had turned their ponies adrift and had thrown themselves down beside their companions pulling their blankets well about them for the night had grown chill
i wouldnt have saddled it but the boss said i must
the fourth guard has to eat yet so there is plenty of time how did you all sleep
who is the wrangler this morning asked the foreman glancing about at his men
anywhereeverywhere
it was the chinaman pong sounding his call for breakfast in accordance with the usage of the plains
you will find your stuff rolled up under the chuck wagon boys said stallings
therell be a lively muss about the time you do i reckon and youll wish you hadnt
almost before the echoes of his voice had died away a shrill voice piped up from the tail end of the chuck wagon
say dont you
in spite of their hard couches the pony riders slept soundly even professor zepplin himself never waking the whole night through
these they spread out on the ground using boots wrapped in coats for pillows
chunky however was too sleepy to see anything so small as a cowman swinging his arms a rod away
stacy grumbled turned over and went to sleep again
why not demanded the boy
i hardly think they would do that pong
where are they asked the boy
the boss said the first man he heard using language while you tenderfeet were with us would get fired on the spot
listen
we will now get to work on the herd announced the foreman
fine chorused the boys
allee same likee this he explained
pong going through the motions of drawing a gun from his belt and puffing out his cheeks uttered an explosive pouf
theres the pony ready for you
now i dont want you fellows sitting up all night objected the foreman
the rest of the fourth guard had already gone out chunky meeting the returning members of the third coming in
the cowman was swinging his arms and seeking to attract the lads attention
not on the range
it is astonishing with how little a man can get along when he has to
stacy shot up into the air as if he had been propelled from a bow gun he struck the soft sand several feet in advance of the pony his face and head ploughing a little furrow as he drove along on his nose
better not try it out on the range smiled the foreman
what do you want demanded the boy
youre lucky to be alive in this outfit let alone filling yourself with grub
besides holding the untrustworthy horses it afforded a temporary corral for catching a change of mounts
you can enjoy yourselves sleeping just as well as sitting up
a wranglers a wrangler answered big foot stolidly
the meal was soon finished pong having stood rubbing his palms a happy smile on his face during the time they were eating
tads eyes were sparkling from the experiences of the evening as well as from the praise bestowed upon him by the big cowpuncher
i guess there are some words that arent in the dictionary laughed tad
pong tell the young gentlemen what would become of you if you were to serve bad meals to this outfit of cowpunchers
little black bull came down the hillside down the hillside down the hillside little black bull came down the hillside long time ago
hes a fellow whos all the time making trouble isnt he asked stacy innocently
how asked tad
is breakfast ready asked the boy tightening his belt and jamming his sombrero down over his head
keep still you baby growled the cowman
the foreman nodded with an approving glance at tad
i think you will find them all there master tad if you will consult the big book said the professor
oh no this kind of a wrangler isnt laughed the foreman
this effectually quieted the boy for the night and the camp settled down to silence and to sleep
if you cant keep shut the bossll be for making you sleep under the chuck wagon
the camp fire was burning brightly when the first guard having completed its tour of duty came galloping in
you boys dont have to swallow your food whole smiled the foreman observing that the pony riders seemed to think they were expected to hurry through their meal as well
dont you know any more than to try to get onto a broncho from the off side
instantly there was a chorus of yells and snarls from the disturbed cowpunchers accompanied by dire threats as to what they would do to the gopher did he ever disturb their rest in that way again
stacy ruefully and still half asleep made a wide circle around the sleeping cowmen that he might not make the mistake of again stepping on any of them
beds grunted big foot
walter had gone out with the second guard and the others had gathered around the camp fire for their nightly story telling
i guess we are pretty sure of having real food to eat then laughed tad as the boys rose from the table ready for the active work of the day
roll out
wrangler
the pony did most of it admitted the lad
those fellows have to go out
it seemed as if scarcely a minute had passed since the boys turned in before they were awakened by the strident tones of the foreman
more than most tenderfeet would have done growled big foot
i dont call that much of a song sniffed chunky contemptuously after a moment of silence on the part of the group
the chinaman showed two rows of white teeth in his expansive grin
by the time the cowmen and pony riders had refreshed themselves at the spring near which the outfit had camped a steaming hot breakfast had been spread on the ground with a slicker for a table cloth
where are your beds asked stacy after the foreman had urged the boys to get to sleep
what do you mean asked ned rector
get a move on you and keep still
whats a wrangler demanded stacy delaying the progress of a large slice of bacon which hung suspended from the fork halfway between plate and mouth
with stacy brown however severe measures were necessary when one of the returning guard routed him out at half past three in the morning
the cowboy did this very thing but within an hour he found himself alone the others having turned in one by one
hi there hissed lumpy filled with indignation that anyone should attempt to mount a pony from the right side
i just gave him his head and thats all there was to it
its your trick
i am spoke up shorty savage promptly
in floundering about making up his bunk the lad had fallen over two cowboys and stepped full on the face of a third
the first night in camp
when you get to be half as good a man on cows as your friend the pinto here youll be a full grown man added big foot
hes a trouble curer not a troublemaker except for himself
you wont be so fast to wake up hard working cowboys after that i reckon
a loud laugh followed at chunkys expense
stacy browns left leg swung over the saddle no sooner had the pony felt the leather over him than he raised his back straight up his head going down almost to the ground
its the cowboys lament laughed bob stallings
do you want to wake up the whole outfit
lumpy bates came running toward him not daring to call out for fear of waking the camp
stacy brown proved the only grumbler in the lot declaring that he could not sleep a wink on such a bed as that
ill give it as a horseback opinion that the only way to enjoy such a night as this is to sit up until you fall asleep with your boots on
he shook the lad violently
even if i cant sing i can beat that
bob thinks it might stampede the herd spoke up big foot sanders
take your time
we had better start the drive this morning
none of you will be fit for duty to morrow
sometimes he does it in the middle of the night when the thunder and lightning are smashing about him like all possessed and the cattle are on the rampage
surprisingly well
in a few moments the sound of singing was borne to the ears of the campers
a very fine breakfast sir announced the professor looking up at the chinaman
better hurry up kid they chuckled
out on the plains the fourth guard were drowsily crooning the lullaby about the bull that came down the hillside long time ago
our beds on the plains are wherever we happen to pull our boots off
does it make any difference
his warning came too late
chapter four
breakfast jeered lumpy
roll out he roared bringing the sleepy cowpunchers grumbling to their feet
at first the pony began to buck then evidently thinking the effort was not worth while settled down to a rough trot which soon shook the boy up and thoroughly awakened him
thats the way im going to do it to night
if you make a racket there pong will dump a pot of boiling water over you
lumpy watched him with disapproving eyes
oh you mean they would shoot you asked walter
the guard chanced to be lumpy bates and he administered what to him was a gentle kick to hurry the boy along
the pinto rounded up a bunch of stray cows to night as well as i could do it myself and he didnt go about it with a brass band either
and you mr professor
off on the plain they heard a rich tenor voice raised in the song of the cowman
the lad caught the pony that stood moping in the corral not appearing to be aware that his rider was preparing him for the range chunky all the time muttering to himself
weve got a hard drive before us and every man must be fit as a fiddle
chunky reached the table first greedily surveying what had been placed on it
if you havent i would advise you to go easy
well do it three times and the one who wins two times out of three will be it
yes
chunky colored
had anything to eat asked the guide
the little animals were becoming more sure footed every day and ned said that before the trip was finished jimmie would be able to walk a slack rope
let me have that hat tad he demanded as the latter came trotting up to the group
he slapped texas sharply on the flank with the flat of his hand
a temporary camp was quickly pitched
then i think ill try some myself announced ned helping himself liberally to the honey and jam
cold water is the most nourishing thing weve touched since last night
this time the battle lay between tad butler and ned rector
then chunky essayed the feat
he buried his biscuit under a layer of jam over which he spread a thick coating of honey
why mr thomas where did you get honey asked walter
rough riders in the saddle
the great green field surrounded on all sides by tall trees made the place an ideal one for their purpose
perhaps tuesday
the third heat was merely a repetition of the second
it must have come to life some time during the night and dug its way out laughed tad
stacy his face flushed determination plainly showing in his eyes stretched forth his hand for the sombrero
the fire would be ready and thus no time would be lost in preparing the first meal of the day which in this case would be breakfast dinner and supper all in one
it was a beautiful race the little indian ponies seeming to enter thoroughly into the spirit of the contest stretching themselves out to their full lengths and with heads on a level with their backs fairly flew across the great plot of green
now fall to young gentlemen directed the professor
yes wild plum jam answered the guide
it looks like jam
ned took his defeat good naturedly
riding bravely out into the field he tossed it to the ground
not enough to give us indigestion answered ned
besides this there are many abandoned mines up the range further
a stout club for mine
what i want to know is when do we go hunting asked ned
are you hurt asked tad apprehensively
chunky did even better than that
we did not
remember sir that a certain amount of dignity befits the office of president of the pony riders club he said
ive seen them do that in the wild west shows too many times not to know how myself
chapter twelve
they assured him that nothing was further from their intention and quickly casting aside guns and cartridge belts they threw themselves into their saddles again for a jolly romp
its good anyway
ill show you promised tad
the boys were now all anxiety to start while the ponies after their sunday rest were almost as full of life as were their owners
walter smiled with a twinkle in his eyes
even stacy brown though he did not sit his saddle with the same grace that marked the riding of tad butler and ned rector more practiced horsemen was nevertheless no mean rider
all agreed that tads superior horsemanship alone had won the race for him
this announcement filled the boys with excitement
ned fixed him with a stern eye
fortunately his right foot freed itself from the stirrup at the same time or there might have been a different ending
hooray fellows he shouted
tad hitched in his saddle a little throwing the greater part of his weight on the stirrups
to this all agreed
i dont need guns to hunt with
by this time the boys had come to feel fully as much at home in the saddle as they formerly had been out of it
the next two heats were different
well take all chances advised ned
we are in the bear country now
you dont have to move the hat you ninny
and weve got a surprise for you announced stacy swelling with pride
texas seemed to leap clear of the ground planting himself on all fours just over the line the winner by a neck
i will replied chunky confidently
didnt you find it
i am free to admit that i am hungry too
i couldnt get it explained chunky
i can do that myself he grunted
with a shout the boys dashed pell mell to meet the pack train and falling in behind the slow moving burros urged them on with derisive shouts and sundry resounding slaps on the animals flanks
thats nothing
the boys awaited the guides approach with impatience some pacing back and forth while others coaxed the fire into a roaring blaze at the same time confiding to each other how hungry they were
a cave interrupted tad
at the moment when he freed his left foot from the stirrup he threw his body sharply to the right reaching for the hat without taking the precaution to grasp the pommel
are there bears up here
suppose we start with a race
an early start was made so that the party reached the promised table lands shortly before ten oclock in the forenoon
id lose my dignity for a mouthful of that any day he decided after having sampled the combination president brown i withdraw my criticism
it was a gladsome sound to this band of hungry boys whose ordinarily healthy appetites under the bracing mountain air and the long fast had taken on what the professor described as a razor edge
honey
the trail is so plainly marked that he cant miss it
i think i shall help myself to some of that wild plum jam and biscuit first it reminds me of old times
found a bee tree on my way back and cut it down
now you may go he nodded
he no doubt would bring food of some kind with him
well race the length of the field and back
hes got to learn declared tad
we sometimes had jam when i was with the german
but whats this
army added ned
why dont you move the pony
supper having been finished the party gathered about the camp fire for their evening chat after which admonishing stacy to keep within his tent and not to go borrowing trouble the boys turned in for a sound sleep
chunky turned a double somersault lay still for a moment then struggled up rubbing his body gingerly as the rest of the party came hurrying up to him
the guide said that by making a detour in their journey that day they would cross table lands several acres in extent and covered with grass
of course dogs cant follow the trail of an animal as well now as they could with snow on the ground
i guess i had better go along to see that you do not
i offer you my humble apologies
why not show us then he said
be careful chunky warned walter
but this dog you will find is a wonder
at their urgent request professor zepplin told the boys to go ahead and enjoy themselves
stacy dismounted and removed the hat carefully to one side
walter perkins won the heat
what do you think of that
next thing we know youll be providing us with bear steak
up to within a moment of the finish of the second heat the two ponies were racing neck and neck
huh
but i left you a rabbit
as yet they had been unable to attempt any fancy riding with their ponies owing to the rugged nature of the country through which they had been journeying
guess i know how to ride
we shall need a dog
grasping the pommel with the left hand he appeared to dive head first toward the ground
galloping into camp the boy fetched his sombrero which he carried well out into the field and tossed away
as a result instead of stopping when he reached the hat the boy kept on going
dont you worry about me ned rector
by the time the meal was ready the tents had been pitched and the boys had returned from the spring rubbing their faces with their coarse towels their cheeks glowing and their eyes sparkling in anticipation of the feast
but i know an old settler who will lend us his dog if it is not out
got your life insured asked ned
i reckon there are smiled the guide
all you want
that depends
i think ill ride my own pony and let the dog walk announced ned
youll see when you get to camp answered chunky
all at once he dropped to the saddle and slipped the left foot from the stirrup
yes the country is full of caves
i came near losing my life too and
stand still
aint no use to expect him to hook himself onto the line even if he does wake up decided the guide with emphasis beginning to haul up the lariat which he coiled neatly on the rock in front of him
all i can see is rocks and shadows
after winding the end tightly about his own arm he handed a lighted torch to tad
ill go down mr thomas
cautiously placing a hand against the rocks to steady himself tad wisely concluded that hereafter it would not pay to be too curious
to this question walter made some reply that was unintelligible to them
i am the one to go after walt if anyone has to
here put my gun in your pocket
there was no response
will it be all right for me to swing myself
no
walter had fully regained consciousness by this time and a brief examination showed that he had sustained no serious injury he having struck on the yielding branches of the pinyon which broke his fall and saved his life
tell them walts all right
can you slip it over your shoulders and under your arms called the guide
now be very careful
where is it that you think you see bushes
i protest shouted the professor
can you make it out
hey walter
yes
then followed a long period of suspense
now what are we going to do id like to know asked ned
dont bother him
but he doesnt answer me
but i dont dare try it
is it possible
but before removing the rope from your own body make sure that you are safe
in that case you will have to go yourself thomas decided the professor sharply
running to the edge of the cliff he leaned over and listened intently
and that tumbles enough to knock the sense out of a full grown man
what are we going to do thomashow are we to rescue the boy
see anything asked tad tremulously creeping to his side
hes so far to the right of me that i cant reach him
what is it demanded the professor breathlessly
yes agreed tad that does look like bushes
whereishe stammered the professor not observing that the guide had left them
be sure to fasten him securely to the loop before you give the signal to haul up warned the guide
one of us must go down there was the guides startling announcement
closing his eyes he clung to the slender support with grim courage until a hail from above told him that the rawhide loop was rapidly squirming down toward him
where is he
hashegone asked the professor weakly
all right
dont move around
after what seemed to them hours a sharp call from the depths reached their ears
hold a torch over the edge of the cliff master ned directed the guide
i knowi knowbut
youll all be over if you dont have a care
very slowly restraining their inclination to haul the rope in with all speed only because the warning eyes of the guide were upon them the two boys assisted by professor zepplin began hoisting walter perkins toward the top
i heard him call
looks like a clump of bushes down there
now try it
something else besides saying youre going to will be necessary
its a tough job
let me go mr thomas interrupted ned rector stepping forward with almost a challenge in his eyes
run over to the cook tent and tell jose to give you those rawhide lariats that he will find behind his bunk
youd have both of us at the bottom if i left it to you to take care of this end
yes thats the only way we can do it
i dont dare try any experiments
lie perfectly still warned the guide
i understand
walts alive
are you ready
as he did so tad felt himself gradually sinking into the sombre depths
weve got to get walt up here even if i have to jump over after him said tad firmly
but talking wont do it
all right old man
its master walt snapped the guide
good approved lige encouragingly beginning to let the rawhide slip slowly around the trunk of the tree
yes haul away
ill send down another rope to which you can tie yourself until we get master walter to the top
right announced the guide in a reassuring voice
they gazed at each other in perplexity
wait a minute cautioned the mountaineer
keep your eyes shut till i tell you to open them
stick tight and dont get scared
are you all safe down there tad
are you hurt
fainted probably
the shout of joy that had framed itself on the lips of ned rector and stacy brown died out in an indistinct murmur
why not get a rope and let it down to him suggested tad
keep still
i see him called tad his voice sounding hollow and unnatural to those above
the boy could not repress a shudder
the guide without further delay and giving no heed to professor zepplins nervous protests slipped the noose over tads shoulders and drawing it down and up under his arms secured the knot so that the loop might not tighten under the weight of the boys body
if you find the support too weak to bear your weight let me know
but i dont know how we are going to get him
then what are we going to do
sure thing answered the boy
but from the cautious movements of the light far below them the guide understood that the lad was at work carrying out his part of the task of rescue to the best of his ability
the mountaineer quickly formed a loop in one end of the rope making it large enough to permit of its slipping over the shoulders of a man
hurry
yes
and he most certainly will interrupted tad advancing a step
im going back for a torch he commanded leaping by them on his way to the camp fire
got him he answered leaning over the cliff
what would you suggest
a daring rescue
a moment more and he too caught the plaintive cry for help from below
dont move an inch
hello down there
but i aint sure
he tilted his head to look up
down there sir explained tad pointing to the ledge of rock over which walter had fallen
better lie down so you too dont take a notion to fall off
it will be better for him to go if he will
the boys doing the best he can
over there to the right just near the edge of the light space made by the torch light answered the guide
well have you out of that in no time
he aint very strong you know
let me know when the rope reaches you
lodged in the branches of a pinyon tree i think it is
master tad is right decided the guide gazing at the two boys approvingly
he can talk now was the answer that carried with it such a note of gladness that ned and stacy were unable to resist a shout of joy
i am needed right here sir replied the guide shortly
what do you think has happened to him asked tad in a troubled voice
keep back
the creaking of the rawhide told them that tad butler was swaying from side to side fifty feet below them at the end of a slender line
you are
keep back he shouted as the boys and professor zepplin began crowding near the masked edge of the cliff
the movement sent his body swaying giddily from side to side
right you are young man
and if you meet with anything unlooked for let me know at once
it was a trying moment for all of them and naturally more so for the boy who was about to descend into the unknown depths of the mountain canyou
no
glad and proud to do it with no doubt no fear to mar your consent not one david thats true love christie
i too have prepared for it and even spoken to mrs amory
ive done it mother tell me youre not sorry
i go too
that was all she did not offer to detain him now he did not deny her right to follow
when the deed was once done it was astonishing what satisfaction they all took in it how soon they got accustomed to the change and what pride they felt in our soldier the loyal frenzy fell upon the three quiet women and they could not do too much for their country
wash had heard drums every five minutes since he arrived but this time he was right and began to cheer the instant a red cockade appeared at the other end of the long street
i mean it as honestly as you do
but i think few brides dress with a braver happier heart than mine though i do choose a sober wedding gown answered christie smiling again as she took from a half packed trunk her new hospital suit of soft gray woollen stuff
no i will be married in my uniform as david is she answered with a look letty long remembered
ah but it was that old mother worked and waited for so long blind now and deaf childish and half dead with many hardships but safe and free at last and hepseys black face was full of a pride a peace and happiness more eloquent and touching than any speech or sermon ever uttered
of course he has any man with the spirit of a muskeeter would
go dear ill come directly
how time went that day
here he is my knight without reproach or fear going out to take his part in the grandest battle ever fought
i thought that would fetch him
come and walk a little in the lane
she never had yet and now resolved to ask nothing but to earn her blessing by doing her share in the great work
then you are quite willing to try the third great experiment
dear i must go
how terrible
my precious people ive got something to tell you are you ready
nature abhors a vacuum and when food fell short patriotism had a chance to fill the aching void
then they stood quite still for a time and in the silence the two hearts talked together in the sweet language no tongue can utter presently david said regretfully
o david you are splendid
this and he held out his hand with a little paper in it
christie was lifted out of herself for the moment and looked inspired by the high mood which was but the beginning of a nobler life for her
i shall remember that was all david answered to that last promise of hers and three months later he took her at her word
quite ready
but nothing seemed to rouse the supine elisha who chewed his quid like a placid beast of the field and showed no sign of a proper spirit
yes david
only this and she touched the flowers adding with her hand on the blue coat sleeve that embraced her i want to consecrate my uniform as you do yours by being married in it
give the last kiss to mother added letty following her example and in another minute david was gone
imagine her dismay when having consumed the bait her fish gave signs of breaking the line and escaping after all for mr wilkins pushed back his chair and said slowly as he filled his pipe
mr
david and christie went smiling away together and if they shed any tears over the brief happiness no one saw them but the flowers and they loyally kept the secret folded up in their tender hearts
what shall you choose davy
i must go cried david with a sort of desperation as letty clung to one arm christie to the other
surely i shall if i give you and myself to the cause and i do it gladly though i know that my heart has got to ache as it never has ached yet when my courage fails as it will by and by and my selfish soul counts the cost of my offering after the excitement is over
he went and christie vanished to make ready for her wedding conscious in spite of her exalted state of mind that every thing was very hurried sad and strange and very different from the happy day she had so often planned
power has come she said softly a few minutes later with an anxious glance at the clock
as the inspiring music the grand tramp drew near christie felt the old thrill and longed to fall in and follow the flag anywhere
she understood put both arms about his neck as if to keep him safe and whispered fervently
now lets be brave and enjoy every minute of it
help me to be brave and strong david dont let me complain or regret but show me what lies beyond and teach me to believe that simply doing the right is reward and happiness enough
this was a favorite dish of lishas and she had prepared it as a bait for this cautious fish to say that the fish rose at once and swallowed the bait hook and all but feebly expresses the justice done to the cakes by that long suffering man
i could not love thee dear so much loved i not honor more
i thought hed give me violets and a shadow came over christies face
a very simple little marriage feast but more love good will and tender wishes adorned the plain table than is often found at wedding breakfasts and better than any speech or song was lettys broken whisper as she folded her arms round davids empty chair when no one saw her heaven bless and keep and bring him back to us
but firstand christie held her friend close a moment kissed her tenderly and whispered in a broken voice remember i dont take his heart from you i only share it with my sister and my mother
isnt it fitter for a soldiers wife than lace and silk at such a time as this
power is waiting are you ready love
david meantime was in camp getting his first taste of martial life and not liking it any better than he thought he should but no one heard a complaint and he never regretted his love among the roses for he was one of the men who had a principle as well as a weapon and meant to do good service with both
david sterlin has enlisted
when mr power presently came in followed by the others they found their soldier standing very erect in his old place on the rug with the firelight gleaming on his bright buttons and bran staring at him with a perplexed aspect for the uniform shorn hair trimmed beard and a certain lofty carriage of the head so changed his master that the sagacious beast was disturbed
yes david sister and sweetheart answered bravely forgetting in the fervor of the moment what heavy consequences god might see fit to send
once all was wild enthusiasm and glad uproar now mens lips were set and womens smileless even as they cheered fewer handkerchiefs whitened the air for wet eyes needed them and sudden lulls almost solemn in their stillness followed the acclamations of the crowd
ill keep it david
mrs sterling clasped her hands and bowed her head
another great battle screamed the excited news boys in the streets
have no fear for me i feel as if i could bear any thing just now for ive got into a heroic mood and i mean to keep so as long as i can
even the lookers on were different
poor rations did not suit him and he demanded why his favorite dishes were not forthcoming
i be i be and the inconsistent woman fell upon his buttony breast weeping copiously
can you bear it love
at the turn of the lane he looked back and swung his cap all waved their hands to him and then he marched away to the great work before him leaving those loving hearts to ask the unanswerable question how will he come home
hes a comin ma called gusty presently
but they are mourning flowers you know
ill try was all his answer to her appeal then proved that he meant it by adding with his lips against her cheek i must go to mother and letty
yes christie
no bridal white dear said david going to her
he said no more but fell a thinking
now cynthy be you satisfied
ready my general
keep your promise dear he answered while the warlike expression changed to one of infinite tenderness
finding that lisha showed little enthusiasm on the subject she tried to rouse him by patriotic appeals of various sorts
nothing can part us any more not even death for love like ours will last for ever
he accepted all that came and furnished forth those of his company who were less favored among these was elisha wilkins and how he got there should be told
good
which threat she carried out with such skill and force that lisha was effectually waked up for he was partial to good vittles and cynthy was a capital cook
im glad i done it for it will make a man of lisha and if ive sent him to his death god knows hell be fitter to die than if he stayed here idlin his life away
christie was going to town to see the regiment off and soon followed with mr power
she put her arm in his and answered quickly
we are ordered off at once and go at four this afternoon
yes mr power ive found my hero at last
ive always wanted to live in stirring times to have a part in great deeds to sacrifice and suffer something for a principle or a person and now i have my wish
we leave them behind and they must be comforted
david sends you these dear
what promise
mrs sterling cut up her treasured old linen without a murmur letty made comfort bags by the dozen put up jelly and sewed on blue jackets with tireless industry while christie proclaimed that if she had twenty lovers she would send them all and then made preparations enough to nurse the entire party
im glad to give him to you christie for now i feel as if i had partly paid the great debt ive owed so long answered letty through her tears
then they were married
my dearest christie dont be superstitious all brides wear roses and davy thought youd like them said letty troubled at her words
before mrs wilkins could reply to these conflicting rumors her husband walked in looking as martial as his hollow chest and thin legs permitted and turning his cap nervously in his hands said half proudly half reproachfully
hes a kind neighborly man and his boy will take my place about the house and protect you faithfully
lisha wilkins look at that and say no e f you darst
you mean it
lisha aint you got no heart
letty smiled at him approvingly then went to comfort her mother who could not recover her tranquillity so soon
youve something to tell me i see it in your face
but christie stood aloof looking at her lover with something more than admiration in the face that kindled beautifully as she exclaimed
now its all so hurried sorrowful and strange
then im satisfied
use only the white inner stalks serve with a cream dressing
lacrima christi spumanti the finest italian champagne
johannisberger schloss one of the best of the german wines
dreimanner similar to brauneberger
good aroma
chateau lafitte has beautiful color and delicate flavor
amontillado montilo and olorosa sherries
graffenberg light and pleasant
barsac rich and good
deidesheimer similar to brauneberger
alice and mary stood by with eyes fixed on the poor child whose struggles seemed to increase till at last his mother said with a choking voice
we mun get him away from his mother
but as he turned to catch a look at her sweet face he saw that it expressed unfeigned distress almost amounting to vexation a dread of him that he thought was almost repugnance
but earnest as the father was in watching the yet living he had eyes and ears for all that concerned the dead and sprang gently up and took his dead son on his hard couch in his arms with tender strength and carried him upstairs as if afraid of wakening him
dead
she bent down and fondly oh with what passionate fondness kissed her child and then gave him up to alice who took him with tender care
i think i cannot go right for i either check myself till im downright cross to him or else i speak just natural and thats too kind and tender by half
again alice laid out the dead mary helping with reverent fear
jem went to the cupboard and quietly extricated from his pocket the oranges he had bought
oh jem dont give way so i cannot bear to see you
he had stolen out during the half hour allowed at the works for tea to buy them an orange or two which now puffed out his jacket pocket
marys heart melted within her as she witnessed jems sorrow and she stepped gently up to the corner where he stood with his back turned to them and putting her hand softly on his arm said
they cried afresh in company
where is he asked mary
the ghoul like fever was not to be braved with impunity and baulked of its prey
they took worse about two oclock
he cannot die while shes wishing him
so food for four mouths was all she was now required to find only for three she would have said for herself and the unweaned child were but reckoned as one in her calculation
so leaving kind messages to george and jane wilson and hesitating whether she might dare to send a few kind words to jem and deciding that she had better not she stepped out into the bright morning light so fresh a contrast to the darkened room where death had been
but when the twins after ailing many days and caring little for their meat fell sick on the same afternoon with the same heavy stupor of suffering the three hearts that loved them so each felt though none acknowledged to the other that they had little chance for life
but just now he hardly saw her he went straight up to alice and asked how the little chaps were
how she would surround him with every comfort she could devise of course he was to live with them till he should acknowledge riches to be very pleasant things and bless his lady daughter
mary mechanically helped alice in all the duties she performed through the remainder of that long night but she did not see jem again
her thoughts ran on jems manner and words not but what she had known the tale they told for many a day but still she wished he had not put it so plainly
theyre both gone said she
and im as good as engaged to be married to another and another far handsomer than jem only i think i like jems face best for all that likings liking and theres no help for it
the board not so formidable as she had imagined had inquired into her case and instead of sending her to stoke claypole her husbands buckinghamshire parish as she had dreaded had agreed to pay her rent
they were like many a pair of twins and seemed to have but one life divided between them
natures struggles were soon exhausted and he breathed his little life away in peace
over the child which yet breathed the father bent watching anxiously for some ground of hope where hope there was none
he could not contain himself
partly to relieve her from his presence and partly from natural desire and partly perhaps from a penitent wish to share to the utmost his parents sorrow he soon went up stairs to the chamber of death
her plan of living was so far arranged when she heard with keen sorrow that wilsons twin lads were ill of the fever
dont jem please dont whispered she again believing that his silence was only another form of grief
mary lay down on her bed in her clothes and whether it was this or the broad daylight that poured in through the sky window or whether it was over excitement it was long before she could catch a wink of sleep
well when im mrs harry carson may happen i can put some good fortune in jems way
jem felt a strange leap of joy in his heart and knew the power she had of comforting him
i took napoleon announcing the divorce to josephine for my frontispiece
we decided to have a country christmas without any help from town
the men could not go farther than the barns and corral
he used to help my father cut christmas trees for me in virginia and he had not forgotten how much i liked them
i can see them now exactly as they looked working about the table in the lamplight jake with his heavy features so rudely moulded that his face seemed somehow unfinished otto with his half ear and the savage scar that made his upper lip curl so ferociously under his twisted mustache
i put on my cap and ran out to meet jake
the cold was not severe but the storm was quiet and resistless
the flakes came down so thickly that from the sitting room windows i could not see beyond the windmillits frame looked dim and gray unsubstantial like a shadow
on the day before christmas jake packed the things we were sending to the shimerdas in his saddle bags and set off on grandfathers gray gelding when he mounted his horse at the door i saw that he had a hatchet slung to his belt and he gave grandmother a meaning look which told me he was planning a surprise for me
the snow did not stop falling all day or during the night that followed
we put sheets of cotton wool under it for a snow field and jakes pocket mirror for a frozen lake
we bound it between pasteboards which i covered with brilliant calico representing scenes from a circus
grandmother hunted up her fancy cake cutters and baked gingerbread men and roosters which we decorated with burnt sugar and red cinnamon drops
its real splendors however came from the most unlikely place in the worldfrom ottos cowboy trunk
jake was sure he could get through on horseback and bring home our things in saddle bags but grandfather told him the roads would be obliterated and a newcomer in the country would be lost ten times over
for two days i sat at the dining room table pasting this book full of pictures for yulka
when i got to the pond i could see that he was bringing in a little cedar tree across his pommel
we had files of those good old family magazines which used to publish colored lithographs of popular paintings and i was allowed to use some of these
on the white pages i grouped sunday school cards and advertising cards which i had brought from my old country fuchs got out the old candle moulds and made tallow candles
our tree became the talking tree of the fairy tale legends and stories nestled like birds in its branches
the cedar was about five feet high and very shapely
she cut squares of cotton cloth and we sewed them together into a book
i had wanted to get some picture books for yulka and antonia even yulka was able to read a little now
they sat about the house most of the day as if it were sunday greasing their boots mending their suspenders plaiting whiplashes
as i remember them what unprotected faces they were their very roughness and violence made them defenseless
as we turned back to the sitting room grandfather looked at me searchingly
he stood in the little entry hall the lantern and his fur cap under his arm shaking hands with us
because he talked so little his words had a peculiar force they were not worn dull from constant use
he had come to thank us for the presents and for all grandmothers kindness to his family
his face had a look of weariness and pleasure like that of sick people when they feel relief from pain
he said almost nothing and smiled rarely but as he rested there we all had a sense of his utter content
he sat still and passive his head resting against the back of the wooden rocking chair his hands relaxed upon the arms
he always wrote to her on christmas day he said no matter where he was and no matter how long it had been since his last letter
as we sat down to the table it occurred to me that he liked to look at us and that our faces were open books to him
grandmother insisted on his drinking a glass of virginia apple brandy after his long walk in the cold and when a faint flush came up in his cheeks his features might have been cut out of a shell they were so transparent
morning prayers were longer than usual
then jake and i played dominoes while otto wrote a long letter home to his mother
at about four oclock a visitor appeared mr shimerda wearing his rabbit skin cap and collar and new mittens his wife had knitted
i suppose in the crowded clutter of their cave the old man had come to believe that peace and order had vanished from the earth or existed only in the old world he had left so far behind
it was a soft gray day outside with heavy clouds working across the sky and occasional squalls of snow
jake and otto shouted merry christmas to me and winked at each other when they saw the waffle irons on the stove grandfather came down wearing a white shirt and his sunday coat
grandfathers prayers were often very interesting
his prayers reflected what he was thinking about at the time and it was chiefly through them that we got to know his feelings and his views about things
the prayers of all good people are good he said quietly
he read the chapters from saint matthew about the birth of christ and as we listened it all seemed like something that had happened lately and near at hand
at nine oclock mr shimerda lighted one of our lanterns and put on his overcoat and fur collar
all afternoon he sat in the dining room
in his prayer he thanked the lord for the first christmas and for all that it had meant to the world ever since
when the candle ends sent up their conical yellow flames all the colored figures from austria stood out clear and full of meaning against the green boughs
as it grew dark i asked whether i might light the christmas tree before the lamp was brought
this feeling seemed completely to take possession of mr shimerda
when his deep seeing eyes rested on me i felt as if he were looking far ahead into the future for me down the road i would have to travel
there were always odd jobs to be done about the barn on holidays and the men were busy until afternoon
after we sat down to our waffles and sausage jake told us how pleased the shimerdas had been with their presents even ambrosch was friendly and went to the creek with him to cut the christmas tree
he gave thanks for our food and comfort and prayed for the poor and destitute in great cities where the struggle for life was harder than it was here with us
his long body formed a letter s i saw grandmother look apprehensively at grandfather he was rather narrow in religious matters and sometimes spoke out and hurt peoples feelings
he had the gift of simple and moving expression
we persuaded our guest to stay for supper with us
he needed little urging
the cattle in the corral ate corn almost as fast as the men could shell it for them and we hoped they would be ready for an early market
youve got a birthday present this time jim and no mistake
when i beg him for play he shake his head no
thirteen
the soft black earth stood out in patches along the roadsides
at noon that day the hens had not been heard from
now read me a chapter in the prince of the house of david lets forget the bohemians
he is very smart boy
if i got all things like you i make much better
one morning the two big bulls gladstone and brigham young thought spring had come and they began to tease and butt at each other across the barbed wire that separated them soon they got angry
when i went down to breakfast that morning jake and otto came in white as snow men beating their hands and stamping their feet
ambrosch be rich too after while and he pay back
your grandfather is rich she retorted fiercely
clearly the affair had to be stopped
each withdrew to a far corner of his own corral and then they made for each other at a gallop thud thud we could hear the impact of their great heads and their bellowing shook the pans on the kitchen shelves
by five oclock the chores were donejust when it was time to begin them all over again
some days he take his violin out of his box and make with his fingers on the strings like this but never he make the music
in the kitchen she caught up an iron pot that stood on the back of the stove and said you got many shimerdas no got i thought it weak minded of grandmother to give the pot to her
after dinner jake and otto their damp clothes now dried on them stretched their stiff arms and plunged again into the drifts
grandmother chuckled and drove her bright needle across a hole in ottos sock
we found the chickens asleep perhaps they thought night had come to stay
we could not so much as see the corrals but we knew the steers were over there huddled together under the north bank our ferocious bulls subdued enough by this time were probably warming each others backs
i was so annoyed that i felt coldly even toward antonia and listened unsympathetically when she told me her father was not well
though antonia loved her father more than she did any one else she stood in awe of her elder brother
for ambrosch my mama come here
the snow did not fall this time it simply spilled out of heaven like thousands of feather beds being emptied
he not look good
thisll take the bile out of em fuchs remarked gleefully
had they not been dehorned they would have torn each other to pieces
we had three weeks of this mild open weather
he never make music any more
we dont make them come here
at home he play violin all the time for weddings and for dance here never
they bellowed and pawed up the soft earth with their hoofs rolling their eyes and tossing their heads
after dinner when she was helping to wash the dishes she said tossing her head you got many things for cook
but my mama she want ambrosch for be rich with many cattle
there is a mysterious expectation in youth therefore it is that we are prone to wander out in the night without an object
he would make a famous scoundrel
of deaof nothingof everythingof the depths
the windows of the ground floor made boxes the pavement of the court the pit and the balcony the gallery the green box reared against the wall was thus in front of a theatre it was very like the globe where they played othello king lear and the tempest
this connoisseur was suddenly fascinated and had adopted the laughing man
it was composed of watermen chairmen coachmen and bargemen and sailors just ashore spending their wages in feasting and women
where the passer by reappears
it was large enough to hold in two rows ten spectators
they are the ancient trinobantes he said
ursus had been tempted by the bowling green which had one great recommendation that it was always fair day there even in winter
in a corner behind the green box was a stable
he entered heaven only by the artists door
the glory of gwynplaine had not passed london bridge
it was not great enough yet to re echo throughout the city
he imitated every cry which occurred in the audiencea song a cry enough to startle so exact the imitation the singer or the crier himself and now and then he copied the hubbub of the public and whistled as if there were a crowd of people within him
a sailor
with that exception their success became so great that no mountebank memory could recall its parallel
a large wooden balcony roofed over and supported on posts on which the rooms of the first story opened ran round the three fronts of the interior facade of the house making two right angles
a certain vagrancy in our spirits impels us to take walks at night and to saunter under the stars
he did not come every evening but when he came he led the publicapplause grew into acclamationsuccess rose not to the roof for there was none but to the clouds for there were plenty of them which clouds seeing that there was no roof sometimes wept over the masterpiece of ursus
the sea is a wall and if voltairea thing which he very much regretted when it was too latehad not thrown a bridge over to shakespeare shakespeare might still be in england on the other side of the wall a captive in insular glory
except a few words exchanged now and then with the tavern keeper they held no communication with any of those who were living either permanently or temporarily in the inn and continued to keep to themselves
at every performance the yard of the inn transformed into a pit was filled with a ragged and enthusiastic audience
at least not at first
this was managed much as at present
they had a great friend in this unknown visitor
ursus had made his arrangements with the tavern keeper master nicless who owing to his respect for the law would not admit the wolf without charging him extra
curiosity applause receipts crowds the laughing man monopolized everything
still it remained local
the sitting room of the tavern had as we have seen an inside door which opened into the court
pay and pass in under the placard announcing the laughing man was a piece of wood painted white hung on two nails on which was written in charcoal in large letters the title of ursuss grand piece chaos vanquished
of course i do
we must be prepared for the gentry
a few steps away from it was far enough for him
tom jim jack replied the inn keeper
what a pity that he should not be a lord
in the centre of the balcony precisely opposite the green box and in a compartment having for entrance a window reaching to the ground there had been partitioned off a space for the nobility
besides the small fry the swallowers of swords and the grimace makers real performances took place on the green
nothing was thought of but the green box
there was a circus of women ringing from morning till night with a magnificent peal of all sorts of instrumentspsalteries drums rebecks micamons timbrels reeds dulcimers gongs chevrettes bagpipes german horns english eschaqueils pipes flutes and flageolets
of what was he thinking
all these flowed from the street into the theatre and poured back from the theatre into the tap
then he added i must not mistake them for delicacy of taste for the atrobates who people berkshire or the belgians who inhabited somersetshire nor for the parisians who founded york
it was a brave thing to dedicate a cathedral to saint paul
even this comedian of jaws and claws was eclipsed in success
these were remarkable talents
chapter three
saint peter is the sign of rome the city of the dogma saint paul that of london the city of schism
london take it all in all has some good in it
then as he redescended the steps at the back of the green box to enter the inn master nicless let fall this profound reflection so deep as to be unintelligible
by the side of the door was constructed off hand by means of an empty barrel a box for the money taker who was sometimes fibi and sometimes vinos
the money bag grows palpably bigger
that success was prodigious
there was a travelling menagerie where was to be seen a performing tiger who lashed by the keeper snapped at the whip and tried to swallow the lash
a cathedral is a sign
the crowd immediately flocked to them but the compartment for the nobility remained empty
between the acts ursus exhibited his power as an engastrimist and executed marvels of ventriloquism
chaos vanquished is chaos victor said ursus appropriating half gwynplaines success and taking the wind out of his sails as they say at sea
do you know that man
the empty taverns were shut up and the lower room in the tadcaster inn was dark except where in some corner a solitary candle lighted a last reveller an indistinct glow gleamed through the window shutters of the half closed tavern as gwynplaine pensive content and dreaming happy in a haze of divine joy passed backwards and forwards in front of the half open door
they began their performances
otherwise although established in the tavern the group in the green box had in no way altered their manner of living and held to their isolated habits
a loft under the arch of the roof contained the scenes and on opening a trap door lamps appeared producing wonders of light
from thisgwynplaine had become famous
the public stood without in the street in the fair forming a semicircle round the stage exposed to the sun and the showers an arrangement which made rain less desirable for theatres in those days than now
the compartment behind belonged to the men the compartment in front to the women the compartment in the middle separating the two sexes was the stage
sometimes he felt regret
as it dropped it set at liberty three legs on hinges which supported the panel when let down and which placed themselves straight on the ground like the legs of a table and supported it above the earth like a platform
it now contained two beds
this exposed the stage which was thus enlarged by the platform in front
what a good turn they did you there my boy said ursus
this opening looked for all the world like a mouth of hell in the words of the itinerant puritan preachers who turned away from it with horror
so soon as the growth of the child had rendered him fitted for it he had brought him out on the stagethat is he had produced him in front of the van
chapter eight
the scene of the green box represented a landscape painted by ursus and as he did not know how to paint it represented a cavern just as well as a landscape
the green box had but two windows one at each extremity and at the back a door with steps to let down
often when they appeared side by side on the stageursus in his tightly laced bears skin homo with his wolfs skin fitting still betterno one could tell which was the beast
it was perhaps for some such pious invention that solon kicked out thespis
not only happiness but prosperity
father you look like a sorcerer
ursus was in everythingin the piece in the company in the kitchen in the orchestra
in the opposite corner was the kitchen
then i look perhaps like what i am
in gwynplaine evil thoughts never ripened and he had therefore no remorse
a piece of stuff fell over them and answered the purpose of concealment
the chariot of the colour of hope which carried ursus gwynplaine and their fortunes and in front of which fibi and vinos trumpeted like figures of fame played its part of this grand bohemian and literary brotherhood
for all that thespis has lasted much longer than is generally believed the travelling theatre is still in existence
in front on a ledge fastened to the van with the window for a door behind the horses and by the side of an old man who held the reins and directed the team two gipsy women dressed as goddesses sounded their trumpets
unknown people had worked upon his face he on the other hand had worked on his mind and behind this well executed mask he had placed all that he could of thought
this green colour had succeeded in drawing attention to the carriage which was known in all the fair grounds as the green box
the eye which could penetrate within this structure and its internal arrangements might have perceived in a corner fastened to the planks and immovable on its four wheels the old hut of ursus placed on half pay allowed to rust and from thenceforth dispensed the labour of rolling as ursus was relieved from the labour of drawing it
citizens and townsmen the gregorian form of worship this great progress is opposed in italy to the ambrosial ritual and in spain to the mozarabic ceremonial and has achieved its triumph over them with difficulty
these two gipsies picked up by the philosopher from amongst the vagabondage of cities and suburbs were ugly and young and were called by order of ursus the one phoebe and the other venus
the passers by were immediately struck with wonder
phoebe cooked venus scrubbed the temple
this was the old establishment of ursus its proportions augmented by success and improved from a wretched booth into a theatre
this fortune had allowed ursus who was the administrator of gwynplaines success to have the chariot of his dreams constructedthat is to say a caravan large enough to carry a theatre and to sow science and art in the highways
he took charge of the horses
gwynplaine had besides for his work and for his feats of strength round his neck and over his shoulders an esclavine of leather
the caravan was divided into three compartments partitioned from each other
the curtain which we call drop nowadays was a checked silk with squares of contrasted colours
the curiosity of one place exhausted they passed on to another
this was homo the old coachman who drove the horses was the philosopher himself
ursus it may be remembered had made gwynplaine his pupil
ursus and homo took charge of each other
so also of the will
hypochondriacs were cured by the sight of him alone
the extraordinary face which chance or a special and weird industry had fashioned for him laughed alone
with this exception gwynplaines laugh was everlasting
thus he rose rapidly in the fair ground and at the cross roads to the very satisfactory renown of a horrible man
the laugh which he had not placed himself on his brow on his eyelids on his mouth he could not remove
besides we must remember that they had in those times means of putting patients to sleep and of suppressing all suffering only then it was called magic while now it is called anaesthesia
it was gwynplaines laugh which created the laughter of others yet he did not laugh himself
gwynplaine had yellow hair
it was like a head of medusa but medusa hilarious
gwynplaine was a gift of providence to dispel the sadness of man
the manichaeans believed the absolute occasionally gives way and that god himself sometimes abdicates for a time
of what providence
its yellow bristles rather a mane than a head of hair covered and concealed a lofty brow evidently made to contain thought
it was automatic and the more irresistible because it seemed petrified
but was it nature
gwynplaine was a mountebank
his articulations usefully displaced and fashioned to bending the wrong way had received the education of a clown and could like the hinges of a door move backwards and forwards
gwynplaine beautiful in figure had probably been beautiful in face
the joyous convulsion of laughter was as a tribute paid they submitted to it gladly but almost mechanically
gwynplaine had nothing to do with it the outside did not depend on the interior
had she not been assisted
it laughed and occasioned laughter but remained pensive
he was removed from sadness as is pole from pole spleen at the one gwynplaine at the other
no such effect had ever before been produced
two slits for eyes a hiatus for a mouth a snub protuberance with two holes for nostrils a flattened face all having for the result an appearance of laughter it is certain that nature never produces such perfection single handed
every one who saw gwynplaine held his sides he spoke and they rolled on the ground
let us understand each other we will explain
had gwynplaine when a child been so worthy of attention that his face had been subjected to transmutation
man is not born thus
surgical sculpture of the kind could never have succeeded except on a very young child and consequently on one having little consciousness of what happened to him and who might easily take a wound for a sickness
nature had been prodigal of her kindness to gwynplaine
by virtue of the mysterious operation to which gwynplaine had probably been subjected in his infancy every part of his face contributed to that rictus his whole physiognomy led to that result as a wheel centres in the nave
but is laughter a synonym of joy
the man was frightful
all parody which borders on folly all irony which borders on wisdom were condensed and amalgamated in that face
it only requires to obliterate the root of the nose and to flatten the nostrils
but he was tall well made and agile and no way deformed excepting in his face
moreover it happened that on the slightest distraction or the slightest emotion the laugh driven back for a moment returned like a tide with an impulse which was irresistible in proportion to the force of the adverse emotion
we do not admit that it can ever be utterly powerless
one corner of the mouth was raised in mockery of the human race the other side in blasphemy of the gods
behind his laugh there was a soul dreaming as all our souls dream
one day the executioner came and gwynplaine made him laugh
it seemed evident that a mysterious and probably occult science which was to surgery what alchemy was to chemistry had chiselled his flesh evidently at a very tender age and manufactured his countenance with premeditation
however his laugh was to gwynplaine quite a talent
what a weight for the shoulders of a manan everlasting laugh
that infernal head of implacable hilarity he supported on his neck
any astonishment which might seize him any suffering which he might feel any anger which might take possession of him any pity which might move him would only increase this hilarity of his muscles
it was a terrible effort and an insupportable tension
however it may have been the manipulation of gwynplaine had succeeded admirably
a hottentot profile cannot be changed into a roman outline but out of a grecian nose you may make a calmucks
he could do nothing with it so he turned it to account
the whole of existence resembles a letter modified in the postscript
it had been stamped for ever on his face
gwynplaine had been made to orderat least that was probable
he was avoided by folks in mourning because they were compelled to laugh when they saw him without regard to their decent gravity
he showed himself on the platform
they had left the body intact and retouched only the face
besides when once the novelty of the laugh had passed over gwynplaine was intolerable for a woman to see and impossible to contemplate
in appropriating him to the profession of mountebank nothing had been neglected
she had bestowed on him a mouth opening to his ears ears folding over to his eyes a shapeless nose to support the spectacles of the grimace maker and a face that no one could look upon without laughing
on seeing gwynplaine all laughed
the facial angle was powerful and surprisingly grand
this led to the presumption that gwynplaine was rather a creation of art than a work of nature
an everlasting laugh
such perfect completeness is not in nature
all feeling or thought in the mind of the spectator was suddenly put to flight by the unexpected apparition and laughter was inevitable
his hair having probably been dyed with some corrosive preparation had left it woolly and rough to the touch
by means of it he gained his living
why not
the operation whatever it had been which had deprived his features of harmony and put all their flesh into disorder had had no effect on the bony structure of his head
according to all appearance industrious manipulators of children had worked upon his face
one might almost have said that gwynplaine was that dark dead mask of ancient comedy adjusted to the body of a living man
if in the presence of this mountebankfor he was onethe first impression of gaiety wore off and the man were observed with attention traces of art were to be recognized
all his emotions whatever they might have been augmented his strange face of joy or to speak more correctly aggravated it
besides this face those who had brought him up had given him the resources of a gymnast and an athlete
antique art formerly placed on the outsides of the greek theatre a joyous brazen face called comedy
the deaths head retains them
women especially shrank from him with horror
man can do nothing to create beauty but everything to produce ugliness
is there a providence of demons as well as of god we put the question without answering it
such a face could never have been created by chance it must have resulted from intention
for gwynplaine the postscript was this by the force of his will and by concentrating all his attention and on condition that no emotion should come to distract and turn away the fixedness of his effort he could manage to suspend the everlasting rictus of his face and to throw over it a kind of tragic veil and then the spectator laughed no longer he shuddered
men confronted that model of the ideal sarcasm and exemplification of the irony which each one possesses within him and the crowd continually renewed round its fixed laugh died away with delight before its sepulchral immobility of mirth
two convulsions of the face are infectious laughing and yawning
i command you to stay at home this evening and he walked immediately out of the apartment by another door
she was going to reply but found she could not without accompanying her words with tears therefore after the first attempt she desisted
her guardian looked astonished
miss milner you shall not leave the house this evening
she however flattered herself that what she had said might be excused as a mistake the lapse of memory or some other trifling fault when he should know the truth
it is not the first time i believe you have acted contrary to that miss milner replied mrs horton and affected a tenderness of voice to soften the harshness of her words
i mistookfor i had before given my word that i should pass it abroad
i do
dorriforth read on and seemed afraid of looking up lest he should see what he could not have pardoned
what could be worse madam cried miss milner am not i disappointed of the ball
after a few minutes pause and some little embarrassment on the part of mrs horton at the disappointment she had to encounter from this unexpected dutiful conduct she asked miss milner if she would now have any tea
but as for this here child b at that moment there came a knock at the door
bozzle paused a moment before he replied and then smiled as he spoke
im not a taking of her part b a woman as has a husband as finds her with her wittels regular and with whats decent and comfortable beside ought to be contented
he cursed and swore as made even me feel bad
and he knew it all
bozzle away from his own home out on business with his coat buttoned over his breast and his best hat in his hand was aware that he commanded respectand he could carry himself accordingly
why not trevelyan could perceive at once that the authority which he had once respected had gone from the man
as he went about his eyes were ever cast downwards and he walked with a quick shuffling gait and he suspected others feeling that he himself was suspected
mrs bozzle who well understood that business was business and that wives were not business felt no anger at this and handed her husband his best coat
i aint got no evidence mr trevelyan
and all work had ceased with him
but he had been found with his coat off and a baby in his arms and he could not recover himself
hes disturbed in his mindquite orrid bozzle said when he got back to his wife
gammon bozzle
i dont believe a bit of his rights
ill tell you what it is b exclaimed mrs bozzle its my belief as he aint quite right up here and mrs bozzle touched her forehead
it aint to be done you know said bozzle
of course it aint said mrs bozzle
he looked up for a moment at bozzle and then asked him a question
the well brushed hat was fetched from a cupboard and it was astonishing to see how easily and how quickly the outer respectability of bozzle was restored
you mean the colonel sir
they dont know what they wants
i dont believe it b
mrs bozzle going into the passage opened it herself and saw a strange gentleman
with hugh stanbury trevelyan had had a direct quarrel
he have been up all this month sir
but he have i tell you
hell get the child fast enough if hell go before the court
drat em all what is it they wants
they havent met
bozzle who had stood at the inner door saw that the gentleman was mr trevelyan
it aint the regular line of business bozzle and there aint no good to be got never by going off the regular line whereupon bozzle scratched his head and again read the letter
but now when a demand was made upon bozzle to violate the sanctity of the clergymans house and withdraw the child by force or stratagem she began to perceive that the palmy days of the trevelyan affair were over for them and that it would be wise on her husbands part gradually to back out of the gentlemans employment
it aint to be done anywaysnot in my way of business
the paternal parent has a right to his infants no doubt that was bozzles law
wed all be shewed up in the papers as that black that theyd hoot us along the streets
mrs bozzle had set a chair for him but he had declined to sit down
perhaps you could put on your coat and walk out with me for a few minutes said trevelyan
then bozzle came forward and introduced his wife
its love for her as has done it then said bozzle shaking his head
mr
when a writer calls his work a romance it need hardly be observed that he wishes to claim a certain latitude both as to its fashion and material which he would not have felt himself entitled to assume had he professed to be writing a novel
if he think fit also he may so manage his atmospherical medium as to bring out or mellow the lights and deepen and enrich the shadows of the picture
many writers lay very great stress upon some definite moral purpose at which they profess to aim their works
the reader may perhaps choose to assign an actual locality to the imaginary events of this narrative
the narrative it may be is woven of so humble a texture as to require this advantage and at the same time to render it the more difficult of attainment
the author has considered it hardly worth his while therefore relentlessly to impale the story with its moral as with an iron rodor rather as by sticking a pin through a butterflythus at once depriving it of life and causing it to stiffen in an ungainly and unnatural attitude
a high truth indeed fairly finely and skilfully wrought out brightening at every step and crowning the final development of a work of fiction may add an artistic glory but is never any truer and seldom any more evident at the last page than at the first
in good faith however he is not sufficiently imaginative to flatter himself with the slightest hope of this kind
the formerwhile as a work of art it must rigidly subject itself to laws and while it sins unpardonably so far as it may swerve aside from the truth of the human hearthas fairly a right to present that truth under circumstances to a great extent of the writers own choosing or creation
he can hardly be said however to commit a literary crime even if he disregard this caution
it is a legend prolonging itself from an epoch now gray in the distance down into our own broad daylight and bringing along with it some of its legendary mist which the reader according to his pleasure may either disregard or allow it to float almost imperceptibly about the characters and events for the sake of a picturesque effect
he will be wise no doubt to make a very moderate use of the privileges here stated and especially to mingle the marvelous rather as a slight delicate and evanescent flavor than as any portion of the actual substance of the dish offered to the public
when romances do really teach anything or produce any effective operation it is usually through a far more subtile process than the ostensible one
if permitted by the historical connectionwhich though slight was essential to his planthe author would very willingly have avoided anything of this nature
the point of view in which this tale comes under the romantic definition lies in the attempt to connect a bygone time with the very present that is flitting away from us
do not go yet if you please
cousin said phoebe did you speak to me just now
there is a wonderful insight in heavens broad and simple sunshine
in short i make pictures out of sunshine and not to be too much dazzled with my own trade i have prevailed with miss hepzibah to let me lodge in one of these dusky gables
well i dont wish to see it any more observed phoebe turning away her eyes
so wise as well as antique was their aspect as to give color to the idea not merely that they were the descendants of a time honored race but that they had existed in their individual capacity ever since the house of the seven gables was founded and were somehow mixed up with its destiny
here we have the man sly subtle hard imperious and withal cold as ice
now here is a likeness which i have taken over and over again and still with no better result
i did not know that my cousin hepzibahs garden was under another persons care
it would gratify me to have your judgment on this character
do if you please my dear child answered hepzibah
but would you like to see a specimen of my productions
shall i light a lamp cousin hepzibah she asked
the spot acquired a somewhat wilder grace and yet a very gentle one from the fact that a pair of robins had built their nest in the pear tree and were making themselves exceedingly busy and happy in the dark intricacy of its boughs
there was one other object in the garden which nature might fairly claim as her inalienable property in spite of whatever man could do to render it his own
but there certainly is truth in what you have said
that little fowl pays you a high compliment said a voice behind phoebe
she was indistinctly aware however that the gaunt figure of the old gentlewoman was sitting in one of the straight backed chairs a little withdrawn from the window the faint gleam of which showed the blanched paleness of her cheek turned sideways towards a corner
at that mouth
he exhibited a daguerreotype miniature in a morocco case
it has been my custom for more years child than you have lived while thus dismissing her the maiden lady stept forward kissed phoebe and pressed her to her heart which beat against the girls bosom with a strong high and tumultuous swell how came there to be so much love in this desolate old heart that it could afford to well over thus abundantly
bees toostrange to sayhad thought it worth their while to come hither possibly from the range of hives beside some farm house miles away
in the remoter parts of the room however its walls being so ill adapted to reflect light there was nearly the same obscurity as before
how wonderfully responsive to every emotion of the human soul
there never was a sweeter one said phoebe
could it ever smile
it was evident that the race had degenerated like many a noble race besides in consequence of too strict a watchfulness to keep it pure
look at that eye
a crime indeed
i have a proposition to make you
it will suit my purpose still better to see the original replied the daguerreotypist coolly
the remainder of the garden presented a well selected assortment of esculent vegetables in a praiseworthy state of advancement
but stay
maules well answered phoebe
you would have seen other differences had you looked a little longer said holgrave laughing yet apparently much struck
the girl ran into the house to get some crumbs of bread cold potatoes and other such scraps as were suitable to the accommodating appetite of fowls
no child replied hepzibah
but put it on the table in the corner of the passage
yet late as it now was there still arose a pleasant hum out of one or two of the squash blossoms in the depths of which these bees were plying their golden labor
turning quickly she was surprised at sight of a young man who had found access into the garden by a door opening out of another gable than that whence she had emerged
there is at least no flattery in my humble line of art
for you are a pyncheon
and yet if you could only see the benign smile of the original
would you like to be at its mercy
it is my puritan ancestor who hangs yonder in the parlor
that last stroke of the hoe has cut off a beanstalk
it is nonsense said phoebe a little impatiently for us to talk about a picture which you have never seen
his character perplexed the little country girl as it might a more practised observer for while the tone of his conversation had generally been playful the impression left on her mind was that of gravity and except as his youth modified it almost sternness
there was a tremor in it too thatas all strong feeling is electricpartly communicated itself to phoebe
it is almost too soft and gentle for a mans
phoebe saw however that their growth must have been checked by a degree of careful labor bestowed daily and systematically on the garden
not surely her cousin hepzibahs who had no taste nor spirits for the lady like employment of cultivating flowers andwith her recluse habits and tendency to shelter herself within the dismal shadow of the housewould hardly have come forth under the speck of open sky to weed and hoe among the fraternity of beans and squashes
if you would permit me said the artist looking at phoebe i should like to try whether the daguerreotype can bring out disagreeable traits on a perfectly amiable face
returning she gave a peculiar call which they seemed to recognize
phoebe was on the point of retreating but turned back with some hesitation for she did not exactly comprehend his manner although on better observation its feature seemed rather to be lack of ceremony than any approach to offensive rudeness
yet the original wears to common eyes a very different expression
coming fresh from country air and occupations you will soon feel the need of some such out of door employment
you are lucky to be in their good graces so soon
she concluded that she must have mistaken some other sound for that of the human voice or else that it was altogether in her fancy
those venerable personages in the coop too seem very affably disposed
the play and slight agitation of the water in its upward gush wrought magically with these variegated pebbles and made a continually shifting apparition of quaint figures vanishing too suddenly to be definable
the sun as you see tells quite another story and will not be coaxed out of it after half a dozen patient attempts on my part
most of my likenesses do look unamiable but the very sufficient reason i fancy is because the originals are so
but instead of a response from hepzibah she seemed to hear the murmur of an unknown voice
to be sure you have found some way of copying the portrait without its black velvet cap and gray beard and have given him a modern coat and satin cravat instead of his cloak and band
they have known me much longer but never honor me with any familiarity though hardly a day passes without my bringing them food miss hepzibah i suppose will interweave the fact with her other traditions and set it down that the fowls know you to be a pyncheon
i can assure you that this is a modern face and one which you will very probably meet now the remarkable point is that the original wears to the worlds eyeand for aught i know to his most intimate friendsan exceedingly pleasant countenance indicative of benevolence openness of heart sunny good humor and other praiseworthy qualities of that cast
yes said holgrave i dig and hoe and weed in this black old earth for the sake of refreshing myself with what little nature and simplicity may be left in it after men have so long sown and reaped here
all of them were pure specimens of a breed which had been transmitted down as an heirloom in the pyncheon family and were said while in their prime to have attained almost the size of turkeys and on the score of delicate flesh to be fit for a princes table
it is certainly very like the old portrait
it is like a bandage over ones eyes to come into it
on returning into hepzibahs apartment of the house she found the low studded parlor so dim and dusky that her eyes could not penetrate the interior
phoebe merely glanced at it and gave it back
in proof of the authenticity of this legendary renown hepzibah could have exhibited the shell of a great egg which an ostrich need hardly have been ashamed of
it is so much the more unfortunate as he is a public character of some eminence and the likeness was intended to be engraved
you mistake it for some other
i dont much like pictures of that sortthey are so hard and stern besides dodging away from the eye and trying to escape altogether
my eyes are weak and i can seldom bear the lamplight on them
he vanished and phoebe lingering a moment saw a glimmering light and then the steady beam of a lamp in a chamber of the gable
a daguerreotype likeness do you mean asked phoebe with less reserve for in spite of prejudice her own youthfulness sprang forward to meet his
how many aerial voyages might they have made in quest of honey or honey laden betwixt dawn and sunset
she did not altogether like him
she set the lighted lamp in the passage and again entered the parlor hepzibahs form though its sable outline mingled with the dusk was now less imperfectly visible
it now contained only chanticleer his two wives and a solitary chicken
my own sphere does not so much lie among flowers
she retired to her chamber but did not soon fall asleep nor then very profoundly
they kept themselves alive unquestionably and laid now and then an egg and hatched a chicken not for any pleasure of their own but that the world might not absolutely lose what had once been so admirable a breed of fowls
what an instrument is the human voice
it was strangely indistinct however and less like articulate words than an unshaped sound such as would be the utterance of feeling and sympathy rather than of the intellect
these matches just glimmer and go out
so vague was it that its impression or echo in phoebes mind was that of unreality
my name is phoebe pyncheon said the girl with a manner of some reserve for she was aware that her new acquaintance could be no other than the daguerreotypist of whose lawless propensities the old maid had given her a disagreeable idea
ah but these hens answered the young manthese hens of aristocratic lineage would scorn to understand the vulgar language of a barn yard fowl
my dear cousin asked she overcoming an indefinable reluctance is there not some one in the room with us
is there nothing dark or sinister anywhere
oh rejoined the daguerreotypist because like an old ladys cup of tea it is water bewitched
phoebe wondered whose care and toil it could have been that had planted these vegetables and kept the soil so clean and orderly
thence swelling over the rim of moss grown stones the water stole away under the fence through what we regret to call a gutter rather than a channel
he held a hoe in his hand and while phoebe was gone in quest of the crumbs had begun to busy himself with drawing up fresh earth about the roots of the tomatoes
if you begin to love me i am glad
a hop vine springing from last years root was beginning to clamber over it but would be long in covering the roof with its green mantle
fewer words than before but with the same mysterious music in them mellow melancholy yet not mournful the tone seemed to gush up out of the deep well of hepzibahs heart all steeped in its profoundest emotion
the secret is said phoebe smiling that i have learned how to talk with hens and chickens
she rebelled as it were against a certain magnetic element in the artists nature which he exercised towards her possibly without being conscious of it
neither drink nor bathe your face in it
pray go to bed for i am sure you must need rest
you can trim and tend them therefore as you please and i will ask only the least trifle of a blossom now and then in exchange for all the good honest kitchen vegetables with which i propose to enrich miss hepzibahs table
so we will be fellow laborers somewhat on the community system
in a moment cousin answered the girl
and you judge favorably of the face
three of the seven gables either fronted or looked sideways with a dark solemnity of aspect down into the garden
the chicken hereupon though almost as venerable in appearance as its motherpossessing indeed the whole antiquity of its progenitors in miniaturemustered vivacity enough to flutter upward and alight on phoebes shoulder
be careful not to drink at maules well said he
since you are a friend of my cousin hepzibahs you should ask her to show you the picture
i dont think him improved by your alterations
could you not conceive the original to have been guilty of a great crime
i never did but have a great curiosity to do so
i know the face she replied for its stern eye has been following me about all day
be that as it might the hens were now scarcely larger than pigeons and had a queer rusty withered aspect and a gouty kind of movement and a sleepy and melancholy tone throughout all the variations of their clucking and cackling
summer squashes almost in their golden blossom cucumbers now evincing a tendency to spread away from the main stock and ramble far and wide two or three rows of string beans and as many more that were about to festoon themselves on poles tomatoes occupying a site so sheltered and sunny that the plants were already gigantic and promised an early and abundant harvest
the black rich soil had fed itself with the decay of a long period of time such as fallen leaves the petals of flowers and the stalks and seedvessels of vagrant and lawless plants more useful after their death than ever while flaunting in the sun
they were a species of tutelary sprite or banshee although winged and feathered differently from most other guardian angels
but soon her senses being very acute she became conscious of an irregular respiration in an obscure corner of the room her physical organization moreover being at once delicate and healthy gave her a perception operating with almost the effect of a spiritual medium that somebody was near at hand
you have seen that picture then exclaimed the artist with an expression of much interest
i prefer to thinkand so would miss hepzibahthat they recognize the family tone
silently and rather surprised at her own compliance phoebe accordingly betook herself to weeding a flower bed but busied herself still more with cogitations respecting this young man with whom she so unexpectedly found herself on terms approaching to familiarity
they are conscious of looking very unamiable i suppose and therefore hate to be seen
my sober occupation so far as i have any is with a lighter material
the girl sat silently for a moment
the distinguishing mark of the hens was a crest of lamentably scanty growth in these latter days but so oddly and wickedly analogous to hepzibahs turban that phoebeto the poignant distress of her conscience but inevitablywas led to fancy a general resemblance betwixt these forlorn bipeds and her respectable relative
phoebe my dear little girl said hepzibah after a moments pause you were up betimes and have been busy all day
goodnight cousin said phoebe strangely affected by hepzibahs manner
if the original is still in the world i think he might defy the sun to make him look stern and hard
there was an odd kind of authority too in what he now proceeded to say rather as if the garden were his own than a place to which he was admitted merely by hepzibahs courtesy
but my cousin hepzibah has another picturea miniature
i will sit in the parlor awhile and collect my thoughts
if agreeable to you he observed it would give me pleasure to turn over these flowers and those ancient and respectable fowls to your care
as to his character we need not discuss its points they have already been settled by a competent tribunal or one which called itself competent
it grows somewhat like the lily of the valley but its height is about three feet
originally the most valuable of these were found in the spice islands or moluccas of the indian ocean and were highly prized by the nations of antiquity
it is very generally cultivated in gardens and has much improved on its original form

forcemeat or quenelles for turtle soup
strip off the shells chop the eggs into small pieces not however too fine
add the wine and if necessary a seasoning of cayenne when it will be ready to serve
that portion which passes through the strainer is one of the three ingredients of which french forcemeats are generally composed but many cooks substitute butter for this being a less troublesome and more expeditious mode of preparation
forcemeat for baked pike
pound well and bind with one or two eggs which have been previously beaten and strained
simmer for a minute or two and serve in a tureen
pickled cucumbers
when they are a good colour take them off the fire and let them cool cut them in quarters take out the seeds and pulp and put them into cold water
they are made of iron and in that material can be bought cheap but as these are not available for all purposes we should recommend as more economical in the end those made of wedgwood although these are considerably more expensive than the former

marjoramalthough there are several species of marjoram that which is known as the sweet or knotted marjoram is the one usually preferred in cookery
for brown or white ragouts they should be firm and when the quenelles are used very small extreme delicacy will be necessary in their preparation

when variety is desired fry some of a pale colour and others of a darker hue
the romans indulged in them to a most extravagant degree
as we have stated before no one flavour should predominate greatly and the forcemeat should be of sufficient body to cut with a knife and yet not dry and heavy

it is hardier than the orange and as one of the citron tribe was brought into europe by the arabians
if it should be in an unsound state it must be on no account made use of
strain and skim off every particle of fat and when required for use thicken with butter and flour or with a little roux
it will be well to state in the beginning of this recipe that french forcemeat or quenelles consist of the blending of three separate processes namely panada udder and whatever meat you intend using
the lemon was first cultivated in england in the beginning of the seventeenth century and is now often to be found in our green houses
fennel sauce for mackerel
veal quenelles
when the whole is well blended together mould it into balls or whatever shape is intended roll them in flour and poach in boiling water to which a little salt should have been added

let this again dry up by stirring over the fire then add the yolks of two eggs mix well put the panada to cool on a clean plate and use it when required
in the preparation of this recipe it would be well to bear in mind that the ingredients are to be well pounded and seasoned and must be made hard or soft according to the dishes they are intended for
tarragon vinegar may be used instead of plain and by many is considered far preferable
when done moisten with two teacupfuls of white stock boil for twenty minutes and strain the whole through a sieve over the panada in the other stewpan place it over the fire keep constantly stirring to prevent its burning and when quite dry put in a small piece of butter
herbert became more unreasonable than ever
in any event her second marriage would lead to one disastrous result
did malcolm give you this randal asked
besides looking to catherines interestand not forgetting how she had sufferedhad randal any right to regard with other than friendly feelings a second marriage which united her to a man morally and intellectually the superior of her first husband
randals loyalty to catherine hesitated to decide that serious question against the woman whom he had known trusted and admired for so many years
for a moment the two men looked at each other without speaking herberts wondering eyes accurately reflected his brothers astonishment
that the captain would welcome his friends daughter as affectionately as if she had been his own child was not to be doubted for a moment
it drove me out of the house and into the railway
no more of it now
we have both seen the same newspaper of courseand you have been the first to clear the thing up
in the meantime after what mrs presty had confessed the cruel falsehood which had checked poor kittys natural inquiries raised an insuperable obstacle to a meeting between father and child
would he be justified in alluding to the report which associated bennydeck with catherine
leave that to me was the one reply which randal could venture to make at the moment
no explanation of the cause of this delay followed
in all my remembrance of you he said you have never told me a lie
randal could deny that he had seen catherine with perfect truthand did deny it in the plainest terms
the bare doubt that my divorced wife might be the woman was bad enoughbut what i wanted to find out was how she had passed off her false pretense on our child
the first which he happened to take up was addressed to him in mrs prestys handwriting
what happier future could await herespecially if she justified randals past experience of all that was candid and truthful in her characterthan to become his friends wife
he would not be able he wrote to leave sydenham for a day or two
gently herbert
but it might perhaps be excusable to infer that the marriage had not yet been decided on and that the captains proposals were still waiting for catherines reply
thats it isnt it
what are you doing here he asked
to perform that promise appeared to be now simply impossible
no
his natural frank nature urged him to undeceive herbert
after what you have told me why should i suppose anything of the sort
it would sooner or later come to herberts ears
even this apparently simple proceeding required examination in its different bearings before he could begin his letter
written under the modifying influence of these conclusions his letter contained the few words that follow
it was for the captain to confirm what mrs presty had said of him if he thought it desirable to touch on the subject in his reply
having allowed herself to be entrapped into the deception proposed by her mother and having thus far persevered in that deception were the chances in favor of her revealing her true positionespecially if she was disposed to encourage bennydecks suit
i have news for you which i am sure you will be glad to hear
i suppose she is as handsome as ever
if randal shrank from the prospect which thus presented itself to him in his relations with his brother and if his thoughts reverted to sydney westerfield other reasons for apprehension found their way into his mind
he snatched a newspaper out of his pocket as he spoketore it in halfand threw it away
dont be angry and do pray remember that the divorce allows you and catherine to marry again if you like
if it had driven me out of mind i shouldnt have been surprised
suspicion overclouded his face as he put the question
considerations of delicacy seemed to forbid taking this liberty even with an intimate friend
i dont doubt that i am free already to do this but it will encourage the poor girl if i can speak with your authority
malcolm meant well poor fellow he said referring to the old servant but he made a miserable man of me for all that
be the results however what they might randal could see but one plain course before him now
without entering into particulars which may be mercifully dismissed from notice let me only assure you that i answer for sydney westerfield as being worthy of the fatherly interest which you feel in her
shes not catherine at any rate i for one shall go home with a lighter heart he took his brothers arm to return to the other platform
it was not the newspaper which he had bought at the station
not lately
his opinion of this correspondent was expressed in prompt actionhe threw the letter unopened into the waste paper basket
the devil take the thing and the people who write in it
he had promised to do his best toward persuading catherine to grant sydney an interview
you seem to have forgotten that the woman at bucks hotel is described as a widow
but that she would receive the same unremitting attention while he was courting catherine which would have been offered to her under other circumstances was not to be hoped
under the exasperating influence of a disappointment for which she was not prepared it was hard to say what act of imprudence sydney might not commit
shall i say that she may expect an early visit from you when i see her to morrow
when will you ask her to let me see kitty
supposing the report had been true
the next letter was from bennydeck written in the kindest terms but containing no allusion to any contemplated change in his life
on the afternoon of the next day two letters were delivered to randal bearing the sydenham postmark
the serious embarrassments that surrounded him were thickening fast
you have been to the hotel he burst out you have seen catherine
if he followed his inclinations in the near neighborhood of the hotel who could say what disasters might not ensue in his brothers present frame of mind
your old friends daughter has abandoned her sinful way of life and has made sacrifices which prove the sincerity of her repentance
have you seen catherine lately
not satisfied with gossip in private the greedy public appetite devours gossip in print and wants more of it than any one editor can supply randal picked up the torn newspaper
do you know randal i was almost afraid that catherine was the woman
if catherine does think of marrying again he said the man will have to reckon first with me but that is not the point
if he made the disclosure on their return to the house he would be only running the same risk of consequences after an interval of delay and if he remained silent the march of events might at any moment lead to the discovery of what he had concealed
he decided on hastening sydneys introduction to bennydeck and on writing at once to prepare the captain for that event
make the best of it
herbert had been reading a rival journal devoted to the interests of societyin which the report of mrs normans marriage was repeated with this difference that it boldly alluded to captain bennydeck by name
he added sydneys address in a postscript and dispatched his letter that evening
add to this that his confidence in catherine had been rudely shaken
herbert was satisfied
a long distance im dead beat
randal wrote to accept the invitation determining to present himself before the appointed hour and to question catherine privately without giving her the advantage over him of preparing herself for the interview
after months of separation he received a visit from herbert
i didnt know how fond i was of sydney till i lost her i didnt know how fond i was of my wife till i left her he paused and put his hand to his fevered head
the one way is the positive way when a man who suffers trouble is degraded by it
these lines set randal thinking seriously
i will do neither the one nor the other
dont be hard on me he said
nothing was known of the captains movements there
you cant do it
you wont write it
let me rest a little he pleaded if im not in the way
i havent courage enough to do it for myself
tell me where my wife is living now
not having heard from captain bennydeck for some little time randal thought it desirable in sydneys interests to make inquiries at his club
he spoke sternlywith his heart aching for his brother all the time he was right
he drank the wine greedily
on the chance of getting the information that he wanted randal wrote to the hotel at sandyseal
had her beauty fascinated him
and yet he spoke roughly he looked like an angry man brought to bay
i seem to frighten you he said
no no of course you wont forget he tried to rise and fell back again into his chair
whatever reviving effect it might otherwise have produced on him it made no change in the threatening gloom of his manner
and now sydneys taken away from me next
try to understand them
i feel for you herbert he said warmly
he put down the empty glass taking no notice of his brothers question randal he said you know where sydney is
im not fit company for you i know ill go when you tell me
shake hands randal we have never had any unfriendly words we mustnt begin now
some days since the yacht had again appeared in the bay
this alternative in the captains plans terminating the voyage a month earlier than his arrangements had contemplated puzzled randal
will you give her a message
in a man morally weak calamity suffered without resisting power breaks its way through the surface which exhibits a gentleman and shows the naked nature which claims kindred with our ancestor the savage
you distress me herbert more than words can say
do you hear that
as soon as possible
ive been walkingi dont know where
listen to reason
miss westerfield is quite right in separating herself from you
and you are quite wrong in wishing to go back to her
randal admitted it
i was so happy randal with catherine and little kitty
my minds in such a state i cant remember it write it down
her letter concluded in these words you will only meet one person besides ourselvesyour friend and since we last met our friend too
was this manhaggard pallid shabby looking at him piteously with bloodshot eyesthe handsome pleasant prosperous brother whom he remembered
i think a man in my situation is to be pitiedespecially by his brother
randal refused to let him go at all
he called at his friends private residence only to hear from the servants that they had seen nothing of their master
the landlords reply a little surprised him
do you feel better herbert
she shall have your message all that i can do to persuade her shall be done
he could only point to a seat
i havent got my wife she has thrown me over and taken my child away from me
oh why did i engage that governess
let me hear what it is first
and you wont forget
and once again sit down
go back to your chair fierce looks and clinched fists dont frighten me
to represent bennydeck as being tired of the sea and as being willing to try in place of the breezy channel the air of a suburb of london was to make excuses too perfectly futile and absurd to deceive any one who knew the captain
dear old fellow i want you to do me a favor
and now rest he said and let me put this cushion under your head
give me a glass of wine
his tone touched randal to the quick
when he said his next words he was almost like his old self again
the poor wretch sank under randals firm voice and steady eye
in the short time that passed before the day of the dinner distressing circumstances strengthened his resolution
yesas soon as possible
give me her address
her residence at the sea side helped by the lapse of time had restored to her personal attractions almost all they had lost under the deteriorating influences of care and grief and her change of name must have protected her from a discovery of the divorce which would have shocked a man so sincerely religious as bennydeck
theres something perverse about me
no im not faint
give me back sydney or knock out my brains
it eases my head when i rest like this
herbert lifted his head and laid his hand earnestly on his brothers arm
alone
he laid his head wearily on the back of his chair
in spite of the appearance of innocence which pervaded catherines letter the true motive for breaking off his cruise might be found as randal concluded in catherine herself
you dont know what it is to be used to seeing a pretty creature always nicely dressed always about the roomthinking so much of you and so little of herselfand then to be left alone as i am left out in the dark
he astonished his brother by a new entreatythe last imaginable entreaty that randal expected to hear
im not like you im not accustomed to live alone
herbert answered its like being at home againand composed himself to rest
you will stay here with me and if i happen to be away there will be somebody in the house who is almost as fond of you as i am he mentioned the name of one of the old servants at mount morven who had attached himself to randal after the breakup of the family
the sailing master announced that he had orders to take the vessel back to her portwith no other explanation than that the cruise was over
i have something to say to her
and you wont give it
im alone
was his mind wandering into some other train of thought
was she aware of the interest that he felt in her and was it secretly understood and returned
captain bennydeck has got tired of the sea
i tried it yesterday it set my brains on fire im feeling that glass i took just now
captain bennydeck had landed to all appearance in fairly good health and had left by an early train for london
after reading one or two of the political articles he arrived at the columns specially devoted to fashionable intelligence caring nothing for that sort of news he was turning over the pages in search of the literary and dramatic articles when a name not unfamiliar to him caught his eye
you are to understand that catherine is a widow
what a perfect gentleman
how nice of you to come so soon she began
have you done all this with catherines consent he asked as he got up from his chair
am i really to understand mrs presty that catherine
arrived at the station randal found that he must wait for the train while he was walking up and down the platform with a mind doubly distressed by anxiety about his brother and anxiety about sydney the train from london came in
mrs presty was at home she was reported to be in the garden of the hotel
the very question which randal had promised to ask in his brothers interests
i say it with pride a widow of my making
you would have seen her pining for the company of other children and would have had no mercy on her
her keen penetration discovered something in his face which checked the gayety of her welcome
with his own suspicions steadily contradicting him he arrived at the hotel obstinately believing that the charming widow would prove to be a stranger
the charming widow was it possible that this last word referred to catherine
i have ship wrecked herbert as the shortest way of answering inconvenient questions
he was introduced to mrs norman and to mrs normans little girl and we were all charmed with him
i should have told the truth
no one knew on what errand he was bent when he left the house
i should have kept in retirement for the future he answered and not have trusted my child and myself among strangers in hotels
he stood looking absently at the passengers leaving the carriage on the opposite side of the platform
randal bought it
exactly what i did
when he and i happened to be left together he naturally wondered after having seen the beautiful wife where the lucky husband might be
the report is premature my good friend
if i had told the truth at this hotel when everybody wanted to know what mrs norman that handsome lady waswhat would the consequences have been to catherine and her little girl
be so good he said as to tell catherine that i try to make every possible allowance for her but that i cannot consent to sit at her dinner table and that i dare not face my poor little niece after what i have heard
it was a relief to randalin the present state of catherines relations toward bennydeckto return to london without having seen his friend
no no i have made the best of a miserable situation i have consulted the tranquillity of a cruelly injured woman and an innocent childwith this inevitable result i have been obliged to treat your brother like a character in a novel
that incorrigible old woman treated him with affectionate familiarity in return
your sour face would spoil the best dinner that ever was put on the table
one moment before you go
i am put on my defense
and would you have seen your child made to suffer as well as yourself
good by dear randal
the allusion to bennydeck was too plain to be mistaken
mrs prestys audacity was something more than he could understand
sit down said mrs presty
mrs presty recovered all her audacity
having related the circumstances she suggested that randal should put himself in catherines place before he ventured on expressing an opinion
randal found her comfortably established in a summerhouse with her knitting in her hands and a newspaper on her lap
will it be of any use if we invite you to the marriage
if he had asked you about mr norman how would you have answered him
randal looked again at the first words in the paragraph
mrs presty smiled significantly
very well
if this is one of your jokes maam
say thoroughly worthy of the course forced upon me and my daughter by your brothers infamous conductand you will be nearer the mark
he read the paragraph in which it appeared
that will do mrs presty
randal decided on leaving her
and how did catherine answer you he inquired
yes
not at the hotel just now
before i consented to answer the childs inquiries i came to an understanding with her mother
his prospects of success in pleading for a favorable reception of his brothers message were so uncertain that he refrainedin fear of raising hopes which he might not be able to justifyfrom taking herbert into his confidence
dont be mysterious my dear
would you have exposed yourself to be humiliated again in the same way she asked
she said i darent after that i had her mothers authority for telling kitty that she would never see her father again she asked directly if her father was dead
is this woman mad he said to himself
you shall hear how my divorced daughter and my poor little grandchild were treated at sandyseal after you left us
chapter forty
how very complimentary to a poor useless old woman
wait a minute she answered
you dont mean to say that you are going to spoil our pleasant little dinner by bringing bad news she added looking at him suspiciously
he took leave of mrs presty with the formality due to a strangerhe merely bowed
have you any message for captain bennydeck
keep your temper
hes an obstacle in our way and we have been compelled to get rid of him
the author only says its whispered how delicate of him
your defense is thoroughly worthy of your conduct in all other respects
i said will you let kitty see her father again
the new number of a popular weekly journal had that day been published
and the captain of course concluded after having been introduced to kitty that mrs norman was a widow
it depends on you to decide that randal replied
a very wise decision she remarked
are you aware mrs presty that my brother
if i had set him right what would have become of my daughters reputation
vessel found bottom upward in the middle of the atlantic and everybody on board drowned of course
randal drew back a step
for the first time mrs presty became serious
honestly
besides if it isnt true now it will be true next week
i am indeed sorry to spoil your dramatic effect she said
randal passed this over without notice
as he took his place in the carriage the newspaper boy appeared at the window as usual
catherine submits to circumstances like a sensible woman
if you are determined to make a serious business of itif you insist on my justifying myselfyou are to be pitied for not possessing a sense of humor but you shall have your own way
randal handed his paper to her open at the right place
randal asked if his friend was then at the hotel
ah indeed
does she submit to your telling kitty that her father is dead
it is whispered that the lady is to be shortly united to a retired naval officer of arctic fame now better known perhaps as one of our leading philanthropists
where is he
worse stories have been printed i do assure you worse stories have been printed
and you would have condemned your poor little daughter to solitude
out with it
there is my news he said
where he is every day about this timeout driving with catherine and kitty
oh dont talk of your brother
she advanced to meet him all smiles and amiability
he wondered to see the lance leaning against the tree the shield on the ground and don quixote in armour and dejected with the saddest and most melancholy face that sadness itself could produce and going up to him he said be not so cast down good man for you have not fallen into the hands of any inhuman busiris but into roque guinarts which are more merciful than cruel
give me my horse and arms and wait for me here i will go in quest of this knight and dead or alive i will make him keep his word plighted to so great beauty
at this instant one or two of those squires who were posted as sentinels on the roads to watch who came along them and report what passed to their chief came up and said senor there is a great troop of people not far off coming along the road to barcelona
what are you talking about man said one of the bystanders i have got them and they are not worth three reals
one of the squires observed in his mixture of gascon and catalan this captain of ours would make a better friar than highwayman if he wants to be so generous another time let it be with his own property and not ours
who is touching me and untrussing me
and if you have any desire to shorten the journey and put yourself easily in the way of salvation come with me and i will show you how to become a knight errant a calling wherein so many hardships and mishaps are encountered that if they be taken as penances they will lodge you in heaven in a trice
it will not do to leave it to thy courtesy sancho said don quixote for thou art hard of heart and though a clown tender of flesh and at the same time he strove and struggled to untie him
and now the squires despatched to make the prize came up bringing with them two gentlemen on horseback two pilgrims on foot and a coach full of women with some six servants on foot and on horseback in attendance on them and a couple of muleteers whom the gentlemen had with them
so then said roque guinart we have got here nine hundred crowns and sixty reals my soldiers must number some sixty see how much there falls to each for i am a bad arithmetician as soon as the robbers heard this they raised a shout of long life to roque guinart in spite of the lladres that seek his ruin
he saw that his squires for so they call those who follow that trade were about to rifle sancho panza but he ordered them to desist and was at once obeyed so the girdle escaped
he trembled with fear and made for another tree where the very same thing happened to him and he fell a shouting calling upon don quixote to come and protect him
don quixote did so and asked him what had happened to him and what he was afraid of
well then away with you all said roque and bring them here to me at once without letting one of them escape
upon this sancho remarked from what i have seen here justice is such a good thing that there is no doing without it even among the thieves themselves
you see the treatment is a trifle fanciful
the singer then drops a second flower into the lap of the child in the middle and goes away and this ends the first part of the game
the ladies
the wandering singer
the wandering singer
the wandering singer
the wandering singer
the ladies
the ladies
mother mother my fair dead mother theyve stolen the ring from your heart sick daughter
the ladies
bed time children
but if time is still to spare the second part of the game is played like this
in they go
around her with their backs to her stand six maids in a ring with joined hands
forgotten too the name of gillian the lovely captive
as before the singer plays and the ladies dance and through the broken circle the singer comes behind the emperors daughter who uncovers her face to sing
the emperors daughter
the wandering singer
lady lady my apple gold lady may i come into your orchard lady for the fruit is now on the apple bough and the moon is up and the lawn is shady lady lady my fair lady o my apple gold lady
to them once more comes the wandering singer with his lute
but i did once have the luck to hear and see the lady played in entiretythe children had been granted leave to play just one more game before bed time and of course they chose the longest and played it without missing a syllable
the ladies
they give him the flower from the hair of the emperors daughter and sing
and the story of martin pippin in the apple orchard is so old nowsome say a year old some say even two
the wandering singer
i dont know what becomes of the ladies
of these things and such as these they ask no questions
the ladies in yellow dresses stand again in a ring about the emperors daughter and are for the last time accosted by the singer with his lute
o dry your eyes you shall have this other when yours is a thousand leagues over the water daughter daughter my sweet daughter love is not far my daughter
introduction
you may not come into our orchard singer lest you bear a word to the emperors daughter from one who was sent to banishment away a thousand leagues over the water singer singer wandering singer o my honey sweet singer
the wandering singer
they will indicate these changes perhaps by colored ribbons or by any flower in its season or by imagining themselves first in green and then in rose which is really the best way of all
the dancers once more encircle their weeping comrade and now they are gowned in white and pink
you may not come into our orchard singer in case you set free the emperors daughter who pines apart to follow her heart thats flown a thousand leagues over the water singer singer wandering singer o my honey sweet singer
they have the end of the game to themselves
the emperors daughter is not yet released for the key of her tower is understood to be still in the keeping of the dancing children
but this is a fallacy
on this adventure he was about the business of young robin rue
once more the singer plays and the ladies dance but one by one they fall asleep to the drowsy music and then the singer steps into the ring and unlocks the tower and kisses the emperors daughter
the ladies
the third part of the game is seldom played
the ladies in gowns of white and rose color stand around the emperors daughter weeping in her tower
the wandering singer
it seems to me more and more as i live longer that most poetry and most literature and particularly the literature of the past is discordant with the vastness and variety the reserves and resources and recuperations of life as we live it to day
we killed her
chapter the twelfth
and she was owned she was mastered she was forced into concealment
she kept her faith with you
we never planned to meet and when we met
i give myself and if i can i will give you to the destruction of jealousy and of the forms and shelters and instruments of jealousy both in my own self and in the thought and laws and usage of the world
for it became necessary for me to see justin in order that we should stamp out the whispers against her that followed her death
its so damned silly
but it is manifest i still live i live and work and feel and share beauty
we range wider last longer and escape more and more from intensity towards understanding
through all her life this brave and fine and beautiful being was for the most part of her possibilities wasted in a splendid setting magnificently wasted if you will but wasted
nevertheless she was not all my life nor the form of all my life
you were wrong in all that i said
life was made impossible for her and she was forced to die according to the fate of all untimely things
and already this astounding blow begins to take its place among other events as a thing strange and terrible indeed but related to all the strangeness and mystery of life part of the universal mysteries of despair and futility and death that have troubled my consciousness since childhood
the blood stained organized jealousies of religious intolerance the delusions of nationality and cult and race that black hatred which simple people and young people and common people cherish against all that is not in the likeness of themselves cease to be the undisputed ruling forces of our collective life
and perhaps in this story i have said enough for you to understand why mary has identified herself with something worldwide has added to herself a symbolical value and why it is i find in the whole crowded spectacle of mankind a quality that is also hers a sense of fine things entangled and stifled and unable to free themselves from the ancient limiting jealousies which law and custom embody
stratton he said we two we killed her
i became grotesquely anxious to assure him that indeed she and i had been as they say innocent throughout our last day together
what i had from her and what she was is but a mere intimation of all that she and i might have made of each other and the world
i look out upon the neat french garden that i have watched the summer round and before me is the pile of manuscript that has grown here the story of my friendship and love for mary and of its tragic end and of all the changes of my beliefs and purposes that have arisen out of that
we tore her to pieces he repeated
she who was so abundantly living who could love like a burst of sunshine and give herself as god gives the world is she here at all in this pile of industrious inexpert writing
how we must simplify
for a time the death of mary obscured her life for me but now her living presence is more in my mind again
in mary it seems to me i found both womanhood and fellowship i found what many have dreamt of love and friendship freely given and i could do nothing but clutch at her to make her my possession
i begin to see that it is the reality of her existence and not the accidents of her end that matter most
she was destroyed not merely by the unconsidered undisciplined passions of her husband and her lover but by the vast tradition that sustains and enforces the subjugation of her sex
but now it doesnt seem to matter very much
indeed there was nothing
we tore her to pieces between us
there had been talk on the part of clerks and possible witnesses
if we had been brother and sister
life is so much fuller than any book can be
what alternative was there for her
it gives at most certain acute points certain salient aspects
we had come to our parting we had done our business with an affectation of emotional aloofness and then suddenly he gripped me by the arm
i will not be content with that compromise of jealousies which is the established life of humanity to day
i suppose he said i ought to be glad of that
the arraignment of jealousy
she might have become one of those poor neuters an independent woman
even mary of whom i have labored to tell you seems not so much expressed as hidden beneath these corrected sheets
what alternative is there for any woman
i had meant it to be the story of my life but how little of my life is in it
for i know that a growing multitude of men and women outwear the ancient ways
one gets angrylike an animal
it signifies less that she should have flung out of life when it seemed that her living could only have meant disaster to herself and to all she loved than that all her life should have been hampered and restricted
she might perhaps have kept her freedom by some ill paid work and at the price of every other impulse in her swift and eager nature
he had just viewed the malice of men and the misery of society under a new aspectincomplete aspects which unfortunately only exhibited one side of the truth the fate of woman as summed up in fantine and public authority as personified in javert
we all have in our past a delightful garret
to teach cosette to read and to let her play this constituted nearly the whole of jean valjeans existence
the novelty of the earth and of life counts for something here
it was this good woman who had lighted the fire in the stove and prepared everything on the evening of their arrival
this idea had ended in teaching a child to read
at times she became serious and stared at her little black gown
at the mysterious moment when their hands touched they were welded together when these two souls perceived each other they recognized each other as necessary to each other and embraced each other closely
it was this old woman ornamented with the name of the principal lodger and in reality intrusted with the functions of portress who had let him the lodging on christmas eve
when he saw cosette when he had taken possession of her carried her off and delivered her he felt his heart moved within him
the poor child who was used to being beaten did not know the meaning of this and ran away in confusion
and then he talked of her mother and he made her pray
cosette laughed chattered and sang from daybreak
he was that childs stay and she was his prop
thanks to him she could walk through life thanks to her he could continue in virtue
he protected her and she strengthened him
cosette was no longer in rags she was in mourning
she called him father and knew no other name for him
the best of us are not exempt from egotistical thoughts
he saw a whole future stretching out before him illuminated by cosette as by a charming light
he had represented himself to her as a gentleman of means who had been ruined by spanish bonds who was coming there to live with his little daughter
nothing is so charming as the coloring reflection of happiness on a garret
jean valjean had never loved anything for twenty five years he had been alone in the world
cosette on her side had also unknown to herself become another being poor little thing
poor old man with a perfectly new heart
destiny suddenly united and wedded with its irresistible power these two uprooted existences differing in age alike in sorrow
nature a difference of fifty years had set a profound gulf between jean valjean and cosette destiny filled in this gulf
the entrance of that man into the destiny of that child had been the advent of god
it is a sad thing to say and we have already intimated it that at eight years of age her heart was cold
the bishop had caused the dawn of virtue to rise on his horizon cosette caused the dawn of love to rise
the early days passed in this dazzled state
jean valjean had undertaken to teach her to read
children have their morning song as well as birds
life henceforth appeared to him to be full of interest men seemed to him good and just he no longer reproached any one in thought he saw no reason why he should not live to be a very old man now that this child loved him
the man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor she thought jean valjean handsome just as she thought the hovel pretty
good thoughts have their abysses as well as evil ones
moreover jean valjean had chosen his refuge well
he approached the bed where she lay sleeping and trembled with joy
the chamber with a dressing room which he occupied with cosette was the one whose window opened on the boulevard
one in fact completed the other
she had loved the dog and he had died after which nothing and nobody would have anything to do with her
it sometimes happened that jean valjean clasped her tiny red hand all cracked with chilblains and kissed it
only as he was five and fifty and cosette eight years of age all that might have been love in the whole course of his life flowed together into a sort of ineffable light
chapter threetwo misfortunes make one piece of good fortune
to meet was to find each other
some new thing had come into his soul
she was so little when her mother left her that she no longer remembered her
and in truth the mysterious impression produced on cosette in the depths of the forest of chelles by the hand of jean valjean grasping hers in the dark was not an illusion but a reality
sometimes as he made the child spell he remembered that it was with the idea of doing evil that he had learned to read in prison
there he seemed perfectly secure
thus from the very first day all her sentient and thinking powers loved this kind man
this being the only window in the house no neighbors glances were to be feared from across the way or at the side
like all children who resemble young shoots of the vine which cling to everything she had tried to love she had not succeeded
the first story contained as we have said numerous chambers and several attics only one of which was occupied by the old woman who took charge of jean valjeans housekeeping all the rest was uninhabited
she had emerged from misery and she was entering into life
at times he reflected with a sort of joy that she would be ugly
three big wolves got abreast of the horses and the horses went crazy
pavel reached the brow of the hill but only two sledges followed him down the other side
at his sale we bought peters wheelbarrow and some of his harness
the firelight flickered on the hewn logs that supported the thatch overhead
the young man cursed him and held her tighter
he only knew that he had first borrowed two hundred dollars then another hundred then fiftythat each time a bonus was added to the principal and the debt grew faster than any crop he planted
the ruddy windows guided usthe light from the kitchen stove for there was no lamp burning
pavel called for something and struggled up on his elbow
the road was clear and white and the grooms three blacks went like the wind
each gust as it bore down rattled the panes and swelled off like the others
from our bench we could see what a hollow case his body was
at last he was shut off by a coughing fit which fairly choked him
it was only necessary to be calm and to guide them carefully
when pavel and peter were young men living at home in russia they were asked to be groomsmen for a friend who was to marry the belle of another village
i could not take my eyes off the man in the bed
pavel was very bad he said and wanted to talk to mr shimerda and his daughter he had come to fetch them
pavel gave peter the reins and stepped carefully into the back of the sledge
now his middle horse was being almost dragged by the other two
his shirt was hanging open and his emaciated chest covered with yellow bristle rose and fell horribly
there are only three sledges left he whispered
pavel sat still and watched his horses
the shrieks that followed made everybody sober
without a word peter got up and lit his lantern
i did not see him do it but this i know after all his furniture and his cook stove and pots and pans had been hauled off by the purchasers when his house was stripped and bare he sat down on the floor with his clasp knife and ate all the melons that he had put away for winter
at length as they breasted a long hill peter rose cautiously and looked back
presently in one of those sobbing intervals between the blasts the coyotes tuned up with their whining howl one two three then all togetherto tell us that winter was coming
on the way home when we were lying in the straw under the jolting and rattling antonia told me as much of the story as she could
she asked peter to wait a moment and when she came back from the kitchen she brought a bag of sandwiches and doughnuts for us
he grew more and more excited and kept pointing all around his bed as if there were things there and he wanted mr shimerda to see them
one afternoon antonia and her father came over to our house to get buttermilk and lingered as they usually did until the sun was low
but the grooms movement had given pavel an idea
we burrowed down in the straw and curled up close together watching the angry red die out of the west and the stars begin to shine in the clear windy sky
while the autumn color was growing pale on the grass and cornfields things went badly with our friends the russians
perhaps russian peter come from farther away than any of us had brought from his land too some such belief
antonias father uncovered one of his long bony legs and rubbed it rhythmically
his eyes followed peter about the room with a contemptuous unfriendly expression
the sharp smell of spirits went through the room
the wolves were bad that winter and every one knew it yet when they heard the first wolf cry the drivers were not much alarmed
the wolves were coming together there was no moon but the starlight was clear on the snow
yes
mr shimerda and peter were on the front seat antonia and i sat in the straw behind and ate our lunch as we bumped along
peter told his troubles to mr shimerda he was unable to meet a note which fell due on the first of november had to pay an exorbitant bonus on renewing it and to give a mortgage on his pigs and horses and even his milk cow
peter shuffled to his feet caught up the tea kettle and mixed him some hot water and whiskey
at midnight the parents of the bride said good bye to her and blessed her
what she did not tell me then she told later we talked of nothing else for days afterward
up there the stars grew magnificently bright
the little house on the hillside was so much the color of the night that we could not see it as we came up the draw
tony whispered to me that he was afraid pavel would never get well
its awful what he says
during the auction he went about with his head down and never lifted his eyes he seemed not to care about anything
soon after peter renewed his note pavel strained himself lifting timbers for a new barn and fell over among the shavings with such a gush of blood from the lungs that his fellow workmen thought he would die on the spot they hauled him home and put him into his bed and there he lay very ill indeed
his spine and shoulder blades stood out like the bones under the hide of a dead steer left in the fields
quickly it was covered with bright red spotsi thought i had never seen any blood so bright
the dinner lasted all afternoon then it became a supper and continued far into the night
they still come he asked peter
pavel died a few days after he unburdened his mind to mr shimerda and was buried in the norwegian graveyard
pavel tried to drag her away in the struggle the groom rose
the coyotes broke out again yap yap yapthen the high whine
they tried to jump over each other got tangled up in the harness and overturned the sledge
misfortune seemed to settle like an evil bird on the roof of the log house and to flap its wings there warning human beings away
we entered softly
presently pavel began to talk to mr shimerda scarcely above a whisper he was telling a long story and as he went on antonia took my hand under the table and held it tight
just as they were leaving russian peter drove up
wherever they went the story followed them
he began to cough
he lay patiently fighting for breath like a child with croup
mr shimerda caught him by the shoulders but could hardly hold him in bed
the loss of his two friends had a depressing effect upon old mr shimerda when he was out hunting he used to go into the empty log house and sit there brooding
we sat and watched the long bowed back under the blue sheet scarcely daring to breathe
pavel made a rasping sound when he breathed and he kept moaning
and the wolves pavel asked
they had too much good food and drink inside them
the black hawk money lender who held mortgages on peters live stock was there and he bought in the sale notes at about fifty cents on the dollar
the wind shook the doors and windows impatiently then swept on again singing through the big spaces
my plan must have seemed very foolish to her but she was often large minded about humoring the desires of other people
he saw his fathers sledge overturned with his mother and sisters
they made me think of defeated armies retreating or of ghosts who were trying desperately to get in for shelter and then went moaning on
we lay still and did not talk
though we had come from such different parts of the world in both of us there was some dusky superstition that those shining groups have their influence upon what is and what is not to be
the russians had such bad luck that people were afraid of them and liked to put them out of mind
the drivers stood up and lashed their horses
he was sitting on the floor by the kitchen stove
it was in the dead of winter and the grooms party went over to the wedding in sledges
this cabin was his hermitage until the winter snows penned him in his cave
peter kept sighing and groaning
the sick man raged and shook his fist
all the drivers were more or less the worse for merry making and the groom was absorbed in his bride
beside a frozen pond something happened to the other sledge peter saw it plainly
it took them five years to save money enough to come to america they worked in chicago des moines fort wayne but they were always unfortunate
peter crouching in the front seat saw nothing
he sprang up as if he meant to jump but the girl shrieked and held him back
the wolves ran like streaks of shadow they looked no bigger than dogs but there were hundreds of them
pavel and peter drove into the village alone and they had been alone ever since
for antonia and me the story of the wedding party was never at an end
that sharp backbone must have hurt him when he lay on it
its wolves jimmy antonia whispered
he called to the groom that they must lightenand pointed to the bride
enough for all of us
pavel knocked him over the side of the sledge and threw the girl after him
peter sold off everything and left the countrywent to be cook in a railway construction camp where gangs of russians were employed
presently the groom screamed
another driver lost control
gradually relief came to all of us
the first howls were taken up and echoed and with quickening repetitions
peter could give no very clear account of his transactions with cutter
whatever it was the worst was over mr shimerda signed to us that pavel was asleep
after the sun sank a cold wind sprang up and moaned over the prairie
a black drove came up over the hill behind the wedding party
the black ground shadows were already crowding over the heap in the road and one horse ran out across the fields his harness hanging to him wolves at his heels
he sprang in beside her and pavel and peter our pavel and peter took the front seat
after the ceremony at the church the party went to a dinner given by the parents of the bride
pavel snatched the cup and drank then made peter give him the bottle and slipped it under his pillow grinning disagreeably as if he had outwitted some one
they were within a few miles of their village now
twenty thirtyenough
there was much dancing and drinking
they went away to strange towns but when people learned where they came from they were always asked if they knew the two men who had fed the bride to the wolves
now everything was plastered with mortgages
the groom had the best team and his sledge was lightestall the others carried from six to a dozen people
in the same spirit adamnan voluntarily undertook a journey to york where aldfrid a prince educated in ireland and whose itinerary of ireland we still have now reigned the abbot of iona succeeded in his humane mission and crossing over to his native land he restored sixty of the captives to their homes and kindred
york was its capital and the seat of its ecclesiastical primacy where at the time we speak of the illustrious wilfrid was maintaining with a wilful and unscrupulous king a struggle not unlike that which becket maintained with henry the second
the cause of the battle was the pretension of the petty prince of ulidia which comprised little more than the present county of down to be recognised as prince of all ulster
king donald was accompanied by his bard who described to him as they came in sight the several standards of congals host and who served under them
the saxons had now been for four centuries in britain the older inhabitants of whichcelts like the gauls and irishthey had cruelly harassed just as the milesian irish oppressed their belgic predecessors and as the normans in turn will be found oppressing both celt and saxon in england and ireland
in every recorded instance the power of the clergy had been omnipotent in politics for above a century
the all powerful intercessor in this case was saint moling of the royal house of leinster and bishop of fernamore now ferns
congal had recruited numerous bands of saxons britons picts and argyle scots who poured into the larbours of down for months and were marshalled on the banks of the lagan to sustain his cause
saint aidan the apostle of northumbria had refused the late egfrids father absolution on one occasion until he solemnly promised to restore their freedom to certain captives of this description
the last armed struggle of druidism and the only invasion of ireland by the anglo saxons are also events of the civil history of the seventh century
the munster king and many of the chieftain class shared the common lot
it is pretty clear also that the last rally of druidism against christianity took place behind his banner on the plain of moira
the abolition he contended should not be simply a suspension but final and for ever
like the two kings of sparta they reigned jointly dividing between them the labours and cares of state
in the early part of his reign finnacta seems not to have been disposed to collect this invidious tax by force but yielding to other motives he afterwards took a different view of his duty and marched into leinster to compel its payment here the holy prelate of ferns met him and related a vision in which he had been instructed to demand the abolition of the impost
lastly the royal brothers fell themselves victims to the epidemic which so sadly signalizes their reign
to heighten the awful sense of inevitable doom an eclipse of the sun occurred concurrently with the appearance of the pestilence on the first sunday in may
the only conflicts that occurred on irish soil with a pictish or an anglo saxon forceif we except those who formed a contingent of congals army at moiraoccurred in the time of the hospitable finnacta
the saxons of kent and the southern kingdoms generally were converted by missionaries from france or rome or native preachers of the first or second christian generation those of northumbria recognise as their apostles saint aidan and saint cuthbert two fathers from iona
abolished it was and though its reenactment was often attempted the authority of saint molings solemn settlement prevented it from being re enforced for any length of time except as a political or military infliction
the tribute was at this period enormous fifteen thousand head of cattle annually
the barren rock about three miles in length was covered with monastic buildings and its cemetery was already adorned with the tombs of saints and kings
as leading to the mention of other interesting events we must set this inroad clearly before the reader
the kingdom of northumbria as the name implies embraced nearly all the country from the humber to the pictish border
now every missionary that ever went out from iona had taught that to reduce christians to slavery was wholly inconsistent with a belief in the doctrines of the gospel
nothing could be more natural than such an assembly in such a place at such a period
the piety of an after age saw in the retribution which overtook egfrid the following year when he was slain by the picts and scots the judgment of heaven avenging the unprovoked wrongs of the irish his scottish conquerors returning good for evil carried his body to iona where it was interred with all due honour
he learned too that there were in northumbria several christian captives carried off in beorts expedition and probably sold into slavery
adamnan regarded the fate of egfrid we may be sure in the light of a judgment on him for his misdeeds as bede and british christians very generally did
finnacta fell in battle in the twentieth year of his long and glorious reign and is commemorated as a saint in the irish calendar
britain had been divided by the saxon leaders into eight separate kingdoms the people and princes of several of which were converted to christianity in the fifth sixth and seventh century though some of them did not receive the gospel before the beginning of the eighth
so slow and patient is the process by which christianity infuses itself into the social life of a converted people
chapter six
five successors of columbkill slept in peace around their holy founder and a sixth equal in learning and sanctity to any who preceded him received the remains of king egfrid from the hands of his conquerors
this prince egfrid by name was constantly engaged in wars with his saxon cotemporaries or the picts and scots
as i turned him over i began to feel proud of him to have a kind of respect for his age and size
he did not say anything for a minute but scratched his head and turned the snake over with his boot
he seemed like the ancient eldest evil certainly his kind have left horrible unconscious memories in all warm blooded life
antonia came after me crying o jimmy he not bite you
subsequent experiences with rattlesnakes taught me that my first encounter was fortunate in circumstance
otto winked at me
her exultation was contagious
up at the dog town i answered laconically
i was walking backward in a crouching position when i heard antonia scream
when we dragged him down into the draw dude sprang off to the end of his tether and shivered all overwould nt let us come near him
he was as thick as my leg and looked as if millstones could nt crush the disgusting vitality out of him
i offered to take her on the pony and she got up behind me
she went on in this strain until i began to think that i had longed for this opportunity and had hailed it with joy
she liked me better from that time on and she never took a supercilious air with me again
look tony thats his poison i said
we might get some puppies or owl eggs or snake skins
i walked away and turned my back
we decided that antonia should ride dude home and i would walk
when i turned he was lying in long loose waves like a letter w he twitched and began to coil slowly
he is all over jimmys boots i scream for him to run but he just hit and hit that snake like he was crazy
i did nt run because i did nt think of itif my back had been against a stone wall i could nt have felt more cornered
cautiously we went back to the snake he was still groping with his tail turning up his ugly belly in the light
the dogs were out as usual dozens of them sitting up on their hind legs over the doors of their houses
that snake hung on our corral fence for several days some of the neighbors came to see it and agreed that it was the biggest rattler ever killed in those parts
i ran up and drove at his head with my spade struck him fairly across the neck and in a minute he was all about my feet in wavy loops
you might have told me there was a snake behind me i said petulantly
as we approached they barked shook their tails at us and scurried underground
i had been adequately armed by russian peter the snake was old and lazy and i had antonia beside me to appreciate and admire
did he fight hard
antonia called him to come quick and look
i followed with the spade over my shoulder dragging my snake
a faint fetid smell came from him and a thread of green liquid oozed from his crushed head
i had killed a big snakei was now a big fellow
before the mouths of the holes were little patches of sand and gravel scratched up we supposed from a long way below the surface
i struck now from hate
if the red grass were full of rattlers i was equal to them all nevertheless i stole furtive glances behind me now and then to see that no avenging mate older and bigger than my quarry was racing up from the rear
this was enough for antonia
i suppose i looked as sick as i felt
there had been another black frost the night before and the air was clear and heady as wine
the dog town was spread out over perhaps ten acres
wed been up to russian peters to borrow a spade for ambrosch
the holes were several yards apart and were disposed with a good deal of regularity almost as if the town had been laid out in streets and avenues
as we rode away with the spade antonia suggested that we stop at the prairie dog town and dig into one of the holes
i felt seasick
now we take that snake home and show everybody
otto fuchs was the first one we met
i saw his coils tightennow he would spring spring his length i remembered
gosh
antonia broke in he fight something awful
within a week all the blooming roads had been despoiledhundreds of miles of yellow sunflowers had been transformed into brown rattling burry stalks
it was just luck you had a tool he said cautiously
it was on one of these gravel beds that i met my adventure
antonia barefooted as she was ran up behind me
even after i had pounded his ugly head flat his body kept on coiling and winding doubling and falling back on itself
she was four years older than i to be sure and had seen more of the world but i was a boy and she was a girl and i resented her protecting manner
i explained to antonia how this meant that he was twenty four years old that he must have been there when white men first came left on from buffalo and indian times
during a busy period of three months the emperor tried every method except the most effectual means of indifference and contempt to reconcile this theological quarrel
in a chamber of the inn before he had wiped the dust from his shoes john of antioch gave audience to candidian the imperial minister who related his ineffectual efforts to prevent or to annul the hasty violence of the egyptian
ephesus the city of the virgin was defiled with rage and clamor with sedition and blood the rival synods darted anathemas and excommunications from their spiritual engines and the court of theodosius was perplexed by the adverse and contradictory narratives of the syrian and egyptian factions
such honors might incite the faithful to combat and die under the banners of the saint and he soon prompted or accepted the sacrifice of a virgin who professed the religion of the greeks and cultivated the friendship of orestes
the toleration and even the privileges of the jews who had multiplied to the number of forty thousand were secured by the laws of the caesars and ptolemies and a long prescription of seven hundred years since the foundation of alexandria
candidian in the emperors name requested a delay of four days the profane magistrate was driven with outrage and insult from the assembly of the saints
but the orientals refused to yield and the catholics proud of their numbers and of their latin allies rejected all terms of union or toleration
at these blasphemous sounds the pillars of the sanctuary were shaken
the troops under the command of candidian advanced to the assault the outguards were routed and put to the sword but the place was impregnable the besiegers retired their retreat was pursued by a vigorous sally they lost their horses and many of their soldiers were dangerously wounded with clubs and stones
perhaps he might plead the insolence of their prosperity and their deadly hatred of the christians whose blood they had recently shed in a malicious or accidental tumult
the patience of the meek theodosius was provoked and he dissolved in anger this episcopal tumult which at the distance of thirteen centuries assumes the venerable aspect of the third oecumenical council
the unsuccessful competitors of nestorius indulged their pious or personal resentment the byzantine clergy was secretly displeased with the intrusion of a stranger whatever is superstitious or absurd might claim the protection of the monks and the people were interested in the glory of their virgin patroness
on either side of the hellespont his episcopal vigor imposed a rigid formulary of faith and discipline a chronological error concerning the festival of easter was punished as an offence against the church and state
but the vatican received with open arms the messengers of egypt
he attempted to remove or intimidate the leaders by a common sentence of acquittal or condemnation he invested his representatives at ephesus with ample power and military force he summoned from either party eight chosen deputies to a free and candid conference in the neighborhood of the capital far from the contagion of popular frenzy
after the short and troubled reign of sisinnius bishop of constantinople the factions of the clergy and people were appeased by the choice of the emperor who on this occasion consulted the voice of fame and invited the merit of a stranger
nestorius who depended on the near approach of his eastern friends persisted like his predecessor chrysostom to disclaim the jurisdiction and to disobey the summons of his enemies they hastened his trial and his accuser presided in the seat of judgment
sixty eight bishops twenty two of metropolitan rank defended his cause by a modest and temperate protest they were excluded from the councils of their brethren
when the memory of chrysostom was restored and consecrated the nephew of theophilus at the head of a dying faction still maintained the justice of his sentence nor was it till after a tedious delay and an obstinate resistance that he yielded to the consent of the catholic world
return to your provinces and may your private virtues repair the mischief and scandal of your meeting they returned to their provinces but the same passions which had distracted the synod of ephesus were diffused over the eastern world
his providence will discern and punish the guilty
unarmed and unprepared the jews were incapable of resistance their houses of prayer were levelled with the ground and the episcopal warrior after rewarding his troops with the plunder of their goods expelled from the city the remnant of the unbelieving nation
from the east more especially from antioch he obtained the ambiguous counsels of toleration and silence which were addressed to both parties while they favored the cause of nestorius
the interdiction of their religious worship appeared in his eyes a just and meritorious act and he confiscated their holy vessels without apprehending the guilt of sacrilege
the prize was not unworthy of his ambition
on the fifth day the triumph was clouded by the arrival and indignation of the eastern bishops
give me o caesar he exclaimed give me the earth purged of heretics and i will give you in exchange the kingdom of heaven
at a distance from the court and at the head of an immense capital the patriarch as he was now styled of alexandria had gradually usurped the state and authority of a civil magistrate
such crimes would have deserved the animadversion of the magistrate but in this promiscuous outrage the innocent were confounded with the guilty and alexandria was impoverished by the loss of a wealthy and industrious colony
the whole of this momentous transaction was crowded into the compass of a summers day the bishops delivered their separate opinions but the uniformity of style reveals the influence or the hand of a master who has been accused of corrupting the public evidence of their acts and subscriptions
the worthy friend of athanasius the worthy antagonist of julian he bravely wrestled with the arians and polytheists and though he affected the rigor of geometrical demonstration his commentaries revealed the literal and allegorical sense of the scriptures
the son of a learned grammarian he was skilled in all the sciences of greece eloquence erudition and philosophy conspicuous in the volumes of apollinaris were humbly devoted to the service of religion
in the age of religious freedom which was determined by the council of nice the dignity of christ was measured by private judgment according to the indefinite rule of scripture or reason or tradition
but when his pure and proper divinity had been established on the ruins of arianism the faith of the catholics trembled on the edge of a precipice where it was impossible to recede dangerous to stand dreadful to fall and the manifold inconveniences of their creed were aggravated by the sublime character of their theology
her judgment at length inclined in their favor the heresy of apollinaris was condemned and the separate congregations of his disciples were proscribed by the imperial laws
the death of theophilus expanded and realized the hopes of his nephew
on all sides it was confessed that the mode of their coexistence could neither be represented by our ideas nor expressed by our language
it was alleged that when jesus was nailed to the cross he was endowed with a miraculous apathy of mind and body which rendered him insensible of his apparent sufferings it was affirmed that these momentary though real pangs would be abundantly repaid by the temporal reign of a thousand years reserved for the messiah in his kingdom of the new jerusalem
under the tuition of the abbot serapion he applied himself to ecclesiastical studies with such indefatigable ardor that in the course of one sleepless night he has perused the four gospels the catholic epistles and the epistle to the romans
he taught that the godhead was united or mingled with the body of a man and that the logos the eternal wisdom supplied in the flesh the place and office of a human soul
in the beginning of the fifth century the unity of the two natures was the prevailing doctrine of the church
a mystery which had long floated in the looseness of popular belief was defined by his perverse diligence in a technical form and he first proclaimed the memorable words one incarnate nature of christ which are still reechoed with hostile clamors in the churches of asia egypt and aethiopia
in the house of his uncle the archbishop theophilus he imbibed the orthodox lessons of zeal and dominion and five years of his youth were profitably spent in the adjacent monasteries of nitria
to purge themselves from the guilt or reproach of damnable error they disavowed their consequences explained their principles excused their indiscretions and unanimously pronounced the sounds of concord and faith
he acquiesced in the old distinction of the greek philosophers between the rational and sensitive soul of man that he might reserve the logos for intellectual functions and employ the subordinate human principle in the meaner actions of animal life
a similar union is not inconsistent with a much higher or even with the highest degree of mental faculties and the incarnation of an aeon or archangel the most perfect of created spirits does not involve any positive contradiction or absurdity
with the approbation of his uncle he assumed the office and acquired the fame of a popular preacher
with the moderate docetes he revered mary as the spiritual rather than as the carnal mother of christ whose body either came from heaven impassible and incorruptible or was absorbed and as it were transformed into the essence of the deity
as soon as they beheld the twilight of sense and heresy they started measured back their steps and were again involved in the gloom of impenetrable orthodoxy
yet a secret and incurable discord was cherished between those who were most apprehensive of confounding and those who were most fearful of separating the divinity and the humanity of christ impelled by religious frenzy they fled with adverse haste from the error which they mutually deemed most destructive of truth and salvation
the system of apollinaris was strenuously encountered by the asiatic and syrian divines whose schools are honored by the names of basil gregory and chrysostom and tainted by those of diodorus theodore and nestorius
i was but a private soldier and if i happened to look to see if i could find out anything eyes right guide center was the order
officers could not curb the men to keep in line
martin
the boys were in clover
shiloh
should you desire to find out more about the battle i refer you to history
w h rushed forward and grabbed his horse by the bridle telling him at the same time to surrender
i remember a man by the name of smith stepping deliberately out of the ranks and shooting his finger off to keep out of the fight of another poor fellow who was accidentally shot and killed by the discharge of another persons gun and of others suddenly taken sick with colic
flushed with their victories at fort henry and fort donelson and the capture of nashville and the whole state of tennessee having fallen into their hands victory was again to perch upon their banners for buells army by forced marches had come to grants assistance at the eleventh hour
i got on him again when all of a sudden he lifted his head pricked up his ears began to champ his bit gave a little squeal got a little faster and finally into a gallop and then a run
if blood makes speed i do not suppose he had a drop of any kind in him
he had a propensity to take every hog path he came to
gunboats and transports were busily crossing buells army all of sunday night
sidney johnson killed general gladden killed and a host of generals and other brave men killed and the whole yankee army in full retreat
our regiment was the advance guard on saturday evening and did a little skirmishing but general gladdens brigade passed us and assumed a position in our immediate front
he said to us give em goss boys thats right my brave first tennessee
they retreat in wild confusion
we could hear the shout of the charge and the incessant roar of the guns the rattle of the musketry and knew that the contending forces were engaged in a breast to breast struggle
his pistol had missed its aim
about noon a courier dashed up and ordered us to go forward and support general braggs center
he seemed to be in deep meditation
the air was full of balls and deadly missiles the litter corps was carrying off the dying and wounded
the mule was loath to take to the water
it all seemed to me a dream i seemed to be in a sort of haze when siz siz siz the minnie balls from the yankee line began to whistle around our ears and i thought of the irishman when he said sure enough those fellows are shooting bullets
one incident i recollect very well
but they didnt
i do not know what it was but i heard gladden say tell general bragg that i have as keen a scent for yankees as general chalmers has
this was sunday
he was no baptist and did not believe in immersion and had his views about crossing streams but the rope began to tighten the mule to squeal out his protestations against such villainous proceedings
when in the very midst of our victory here comes an order to halt what halt after todays victory
the rope however was stronger than the mules no and he was finally prevailed upon by the strength of the rope to cross the creek
the harvest was great and the laborers were not few
i had been feeling mean all the morning as if i had stolen a sheep but when the order to charge was given i got happy
the fact was kept from the troops
our regiment was the advance outpost and we saw the skirmish line of the federals advancing and then their main line and then their artillery
he was wise in his own conceit
i do not pretend to tell of what command distinguished itself of heroes of blood and wounds of shrieks and groans of brilliant charges of cannon captured etc
we were jubilant we were triumphant
he was not a fast mule and i soon found out that he thought he knew as much as i did
i soon found out that he had caught sight of the relief on the road and was afraid to shoot
we marched plumb into the yankee lines with their flags flying
by this time our command had reformed and charged the blazing crest
i halted him and told him to go down to the main picket on the road and pass but he seemed so smiling that i thought he knew me or had a good joke to tell me
i was on the skirmish line
we were ordered forward to the attack
the crest occupied by the yankees was belching loud with fire and smoke and the rebels were falling like leaves of autumn in a hurricane the leaden hail storm swept them off the field
it was said to be buckeye whisky
finally says i lets play quits
from chattanooga braggs army went to murfreesboro
our advanced outpost was established at lavergne
the ball missed its aim
general cheatham came up and advanced
i was afraid to halloo to the relief and you may be sure i was in a bad fix
his pistol was leveled and i was ordered to march
i saw either victory or death written on his face
i was on picket at the time the advance was made by rosecrans
i did not fall back but continued to load and shoot until a fragment of a shell struck me on the arm and then a minnie ball passed through the same paralyzing my arm and wounded and disabled me
but they continued to advance upon us we firing and retreating slowly
i looked at it pretty close and i said great god for i could see his heart throb and the respiration of his lungs i was filled with wonder and horror at the sight
at the time mentioned i was standing about two hundred yards off the road the main body of the pickets being on the nashville and murfreesboro turnpike and commanded by lieutenant hardy murfree of the rutherford rifles
robbing a dead yankee
i quickly made up my mind
i said o o im wounded and at the same time i grabbed my arm
i had orders to allow no one to pass
our pickets had run in and reported a night attack
we had several pretty sharp brushes with them that day
there i was a prisoner sure and no mistake about it
but i could not bear the thought of wearing dead mens shoes
but here they werethe yankeesa battle had to be fought we were ordered forward
our army stopped at murfreesboro
i was perfectly willing to let the spy go on his way rejoicingfor such he wasbut he wanted to capture a rebel
i took hold of the foot and raised it up and made one trial at the boot to get it off
they couldnt tell our own men from yankees
i am a videt you know the responsibility resting on me
he divined my motive and fired
this i do know to be a fact
we ran forward expecting that our men would recognize us but they opened fire upon us
i think you are a soldier you look like a gentleman
is it a bargain
says he i would not trust a secesh on his word oath or bond
the next day the yankees were found out to be advancing
the spectacle was grand
they fell back and reformed
from time to time different regiments were sent forward to do picket duty
he was stone dead but i dropped that foot quick
i dropped the gun
i called lieutenant colonel friersons attention to the yankees and he remarked well i dont know whether they are yankees or not but if they are they will come out of there mighty quick
the federal army was concentrating at nashville
march i say
i do not know to what regiment he belonged but i remember of first noticing that his left arm was entirely gone
soon they came in sight of our picket
major allen of the twenty seventh tennessee regiment took the saddle and bridle and gave me the blanket
there was no rest for the weary
in passing over the battlefield i came across a dead yankee colonel he had on the finest clothes i ever saw a red sash and fine sword i particularly noticed his boots
we were right upon the yankee line on the wilkerson turnpike
i happened to look up and the colonel had his eyes wide open and seemed to be looking at me
it was my first and last attempt to rob a dead yankee
you go your way and leave me here
captain james of cheathams staff was sent forward and killed in his own yard
general cheatham all the time was calling on the men to go forward saying come on boys and follow me
john barleycorn was general in chief
he was walking along when all at once he dropped down and died without a struggle or a groan i could tell of hundreds of such incidents of the battlefield but tell only this one because i remember it so distinctly
he put spurs to his horse but i pulled down on him and almost tore the fore shoulder of his horse entirely off but i did not capture the spy though i captured the horse bridle and saddle
the yankees marched over the hill out of sight
we remained several months but soon we were on the tramp again
as i went back to the field hospital i overtook another man walking along
i remember that they had to cross an open field in our front and we were lying behind a fence and as they advanced we kept up firing and would run them back every time until they brought up a regiment that whooped and yelled and charged our skirmish line and then we fell back again
the breast and sleeve of his coat had been torn away and i could see the frazzled end of his shirt sleeve which appeared to be sucked into the wound
they couldnt see straight
the yankee picket lines were not a half mile off
it was an order from general leonidas polk to allow the bearer to pass
the ground was literally covered with blue coats dead and if i remember correctly there were eighty dead horses
murfreesboro
battle of murfreesboro
our generals and colonels and captains had kissed john a little too often
it was christmas
i thought it had been torn from my shoulder
and i had made up my mind to think likewise
we came from knoxville to chattanooga and seemed destined to make a permanent stay here
i read it and looked up to hand it back to him when i discovered that he had a pistol cocked and leveled in my face and says he drop that gun you are my prisoner i saw there was no use in fooling about it
my gun was at my feet and one step would get it
a universal cry was raised you are firing on your own men cease firing cease firing i hallooed in fact the whole skirmish line hallooed and kept on telling them that they were yankees and to shoot but the order was to cease firing you are firing on your own men
his face was as white as a sheet
in fact no one was expected to pass at this point but while standing at my post a horseman rode up behind me
we kept falling back and firing all day and were relieved by another regiment about dark
they persuaded eloquently
we were inured to privations and hardships had been upon every march in every battle in every skirmish in every advance in every retreat in every victory in every defeat
after remaining a good long time at jonesboro the news came that we were going to flank atlanta
i was walking along rather thoughtlessly and carelessly when one inch more and i would have disappeared also
but i was determined to find him so i kept on hallooing and he answering
yank says what you doing johnny
johnny says we are flanking
the army had been passing a given point and jim was sitting quietly on the fence looking at the soldiers
we walked over this floating bridge and soon found ourselves on the tennessee side of tennessee river
the soldiers were in good spirits but it was the spirit of innocence and peace not war and victory
but how to get him out was the unsolved problem
there was no tree or house to be seen and then again the voice seemed to answer from under the ground in a hollow sepulchral tone but i could not tell where he was
i was simply one of hundreds of thousands in the same fix
the tale is the same that every soldier would tell except jim whitler
the third day it was reported that the yankees had taken position on the murfreesboro pike
a flank means a go around
we arrived and remained at tuscumbia several days awaiting the laying of the pontoons across the tennessee river at florence alabama and then we all crossed over
while at tuscumbia john branch and i saw a nice sweet potato patch that looked very tempting to a hungry rebel
he stayed with the company two days
advance into tennessee
how every pulse did beat and leap and how every heart did throb with emotions of joy which seemed nearly akin to heaven when we received the glad intelligence of our onward march toward the land of promise and of our loved ones
going back to camp i procured a light and after whooping and hallooing for a long time i heard another groan this time much louder than before
the cold november winds coming off the mountains of the northwest were blowing right in our faces and nearly cutting us in two
he didnt see anything to run from but the other soldiers began to run and jim run too
a regiment was sent to the attack
reader you should have seen how that old railroad did flop over and how the darkies did sweat and how the perfume did fill the atmosphere
on our way up there the yankee cavalry followed us to see how we were getting along with the flanking business
we flanked it
i went to the place where the voice appeared to come out of the earth
jim had not learned the word halt and just kept on running
the voice appeared to be overhead
when we would get to a stream the pontoons would be thrown across and hoods army would cross
we marched from decatur to florence
the old place looked natural like only it seemed to have a sort of graveyard loneliness about it
hoods army was taking up every able bodied man and conscripting him into the army
i could not imagine what had become of him
we were walking along he a little in the rear when he suddenly disappeared
jim tried to beg off but all entreaty was in vain he wanted to go by home and tell his wife and children good bye and to get his clothes
he loaded and fired the second time when they were ordered to retreat
when we arrived at dalton we had a desire to see how the old place looked not that we cared anything about it but we just wanted to take a last farewell look at the old place
on leaving dalton after a days march we had stopped for the night our guns were stacked and i started off with a comrade to get some wood to cook supper with
but we always flanked these little affairs
they persuaded effectuallythose feelers did
tuscumbia
we jumped over the fence and commenced grabbling for the sweet potatoes
a man in the well
it was no go
jim was soon in line and was tramping to the music of the march
it took us four months in the first instance and but little longer than as many days in the second to get back to dalton our starting point
we looked all around and thought that the coast was clear
yank says bully for you
i looked everywhere
we capture dalton
we saw the united states flag flying from the ramparts and thought that yank would probably be asleep or catching lice or maybe engaged in a game of seven up
jim had dodged about and had escaped being conscripted until hoods raid he called it
we broke and run like quarter horses and the guard pulled down on us just as we jumped the fence
i called and called but could get no answer
we had pontoons made for the purpose of crossing streams
it was jims regiment
he didnt know b from a bulls foot in the spelling book
the country looked like it did at first citizens came out and seemed glad to see us and would divide their onions garlic and leek with us
we marched the black rascals out
they said that sherman had told them not to come out of that block house any how
but there were some yankee soldiers in a block house at ringgold gap who thought they would act big
here the pontoon bridges were nicely and beautifully stretched across the river
and nightly we pitch our moving tent a days march nearer home
the regiment was ordered to fire
the earth seemed to have opened and swallowed him
we passed all those glorious battlefields that have been made classic in history frequently coming across the skull of some poor fellow sitting on top of a stump grinning a ghastly smile also the bones of horses along the road and fences burned and destroyed and occasionally the charred remains of a once fine dwelling house
he walked up and says hello boys
i deny that for the last six months i have been using mr snellings home as if it were a boarding house
but that is not the only society the world contains
you want someone who can look after you and you could not by any chance have chosen a person who will look after you better than i shall
her love
which is just as well
i have drawn up a list of all the people who ought to give us a present and i shall tell them what they ought to giveit wont be my fault if i dont get it
the members of the family looked at one another
i did not want any unpleasantness and i am quite sure there would have been unpleasantness had i demurred
the snellings have an aunt who lives in an out of the way hole at the other end of nowhere
i have given mary ann two or three trifles and i said so
there was william henry john frank ferdinand augustus and stephen arthur
still i noticed that the ring fitted her perfectly and i could not but wonder if she had tried it on before
but that was no reason why the monday week following four of her brothers should have called on me on their way to the office when i was scarcely out of bed and actually breakfasting and assailed me in the way in which they did
the girl is fretting but you dont seem to notice it
the alteration which has taken place in their demeanour since my accident with mary ann is therefore all the more amazing
whiting and mary ann
it might just as well be some one elses wedding so unimportant is the part which i am set to play in it
to begin with she had six brothers and five sisters and she is the eldest of the batch and theres not one of the brothers whom i feel drawn to
i was not pressed for time
and as you dont appear to know what is the proper thing to do in a case of this kind and dont understand that the ring ought to be bought straight away weve bought it for you
i had been with mary ann to church and had seen her home and had had a little supper and it was after supper that it happened
her face was close to mine or my face was close to hers and then her lips came into contact with my lips or my lips came into contact with her lipsi dont know which it wasand then at that moment her mother came into the room and she said mr
and of course i had my expectations and she had hers
nor did i take any steps in that direction during the whole of that week
it is true that i have dropped in to dinner now and then or to spend the evening or for an afternoon call or for an hour or two in the morning but that has been simply and solely because the snelling family have evinced so marked a desire for my society
she will keep them at bay
each of them twice my size and all of them frightfully ignorant and wholly regardless of the sensitive little points of those with whom they came in contact
mary ann beamed at me and she said you dear old man presently she continued
i shall do nothing of the kind
the accident in question occurred upon the sunday evening
of course there are some people with whom you cant be perfectly plain but i shall be as plain as i can theres a way and a manner of doing that kind of thing
i had never had one but i saw clearly that in that way the money would go twice as far
but mary ann does not seem to think that that matters so why should i her youngest sister clara louisa has quite gratuitously informed me that she has had them by her for some considerable time and that not to put too fine a point on it they were originally designed for another individual altogethera mr pilbeam
but why on that account they should pity me i altogether fail to understand
a bird in the hand is worth two in a bushand it will be something to have by us
after dinner i took advantage of an opportunity which offered to thank mary ann for her action in the matter because of course i had no wish to spend my honeymoon in a place of which i knew nothing to oblige an aunt of whom i knew still less
the matter was talked about at dinner
it was plain that together we should manage most comfortably
only i found it difficult to explain and when i did explain she would not understand
i did not go and purchase the engagement ring the first thing on the monday morning i own it
it is true that there are times when i am a little disposed to wish that she were not quite so good a manager now and then every man likes to call his soul his own
but she went on with the most perfect fluency
her head dropped on my shoulder and she kissed me under the chin observing you dear old sam the moments when i am alone with mary ann are alleviations for those more frequent moments when i am not alone with mary ann
it is most delightful
my belief is that they have been induced to spend at least twice as much as they intended and that they resent it
it turned out that she had a little money of her own about a hundred and thirty pounds a year
a handsome price it was
at least i drew up a list of people who ought to meet the occasion and i tried in more than one instance to drop a hint of what as i felt they ought to meet it with
they produced the ring and told me what i had to pay for it
i endeavoured to explain to her that i felt sure of it but i fear that my explanation was a little stumbling
he has given us free passes all the way to the end of our journey and all the way back again and coupons for free board and lodging at the hotel
the mere suggestion is absurd
besides i was turning things over in my mind
it is certain that we have a large collection of really valuable property about the housethe wedding presents to mary ann
all apparently that is left for me to do is to pay for everything
nothing of the kind
she has a knack of getting people to do what she wishes and to give her what she wants which is a little short of miraculous
i endeavoured to
i do not know what he meant and would rather not attempt to imagine
there she owns a cottage or it may be a pigstye for all i know
its a wedding present
mary ann was silent for some time then she quietly remarked
it is to take place on tuesday fortnight
it is true that they are a trifle large for me and that i shall never be able to keep them on my feet except when i am sitting still
i shall make papa give me five hundred pounds at least
whiting may i ask what is the meaning of this i said it meant nothingnothing
i was persuaded that somebody besides that cousin got a profit out of mary anns engagement ring
thats it on your account
besides which we can always sell the coupons and railway passes which we dont use
look here whiting how about mary anns ring
i told her exactly what my income was and the source from which it came and all about it
do you know that in marrying me you are doing the best thing for yourself that you ever did in all your life
i found that as a woman of business she was beyond all my expectations
such an assurance was most satisfactory
it is from her action in that matter that my suspicion springs
there is no circumlocution about them they go straight at what they want and were scarcely inside my door before they blurted out the purport of their coming
dont trouble yourselves to discuss aunt bradys proposal
but after a very considerable pause her mother said with quite unusual mildness very well my dear then its settled
p sthe cards are out for the wedding
so that as mary ann says our honeymoon need cost us practically nothing
mr
i have no intention of being presented with an endless collection of duplicates or a lot of useless rubbish which i dont know what to do with
her father is a most remarkable person to say the least
from a cousin of ours whos in that line
absolutely nothing
a second cousin of mary anns is in the cooks tours line
on the other hand she is well qualified to protect me from the rest of the family
i never saw people like the snellings for possessing relatives in all sorts of lines no matter what you want or do not want and never will want they are sure to have some relative who has dealt in it his or her whole life long
as it is unless i am mistaken some of the rending will be on our side
but i am bound to admit that so far my success has been as nothing compared with hers
i will take care that my relations do their duty
it was an admirable plan
her manner was not at all the sort of thing i care for the result is that i am engaged to mary ann snelling without being conscious of having entertained any intention of the kind
it was frederick augustus if the thing is possible he is if anything more direct even than the rest of his family
and they know it
delightfully in fact
she drew up a plan on which we were to lay it out
there were no signs of faltering about her flow of language
hers has been prodigious
someone sniggered
we had a long confidential chat on matters of business
i did not mean to kiss her it was a pure accident
if she had been like me they would have rent us limb from limb
this observation was followed by perfect silence
we have all been giving mary ann presents and i suppose you mr whiting have been giving her something too that was what mrs macpherson said to me only the other day
and it is all the result of an accident
certainly not
i gaspedpositively gasped
not that i have a word to say against mary ann except that i never knew a girl with quite so many relations
when she heard of my engagement with mary ann she wrote and suggested that we should spend our honeymoon in her cottage or pigstye and that i should pay her rent for it
i cannot pretend to explain why except on the supposition that romance is dead at least in that circle of society in which the snellings move
nothing could be more delightful
and what inquired mrs macpherson has mary ann given you
we are going for our honeymoon to italy and the south of france
the fact of having given mary ann a wedding present seems to fill them with a feeling of rancorous acidity which to me is inexplicable
the womans name is brady
yes
and it kept on snowing that turned out to be quite a record in the way of snow storms
i had not come all that way and subjected myself to so much discomfort to be played tricks with
presently feet were heard advancing along the passageseveral pairs it seemedand a light gleamed through the window over the door
i would not give him pills
i heard it tinkle in the distance
i counted seven in a distance i am convinced of less than twenty miles
i had long been wishing that an oldfashioned christmas had been completely extinct before i had thought of adventuring in quest of one
no doubt the five guineas were badly wanted even a lively family would be hardly likely to advertise for a perfect stranger to spend christmas with them if they were not
it was a horrible journey
next time will do
perhaps you had better come inside
it is some satisfaction for me to be able to reflect that i made it warm for the officials however cold i might have been myself
that was the advertisement
are the people mad
there was something in the tone of his ah which whetted my curiosity near the end of my tether though i was
by the time the streets were like so many skating rinks it commenced to snow
was there a chuckle in the fellows voice
mr christopher from london
there appeared to be no knocker though whether it had been twisted off was more than i could say
she was apparently the careworn mother of a lively family under such circumstances she was hardly likely to be lively herself but her name was madge and it was the accident of her christian name which decided me to go
my temper was rising
she and her husband who suffers from melancholia and all the other complaints which flesh is heir to and i dragging through what i call a patent medicine dinner and talking of everybody who is dead and gone or else going and of nothing else
that was all she said
is there no one in the place
there was a rush of retreating feet an expostulating voice then darkness again and silence
when the train did start some forty minutes after scheduled time it jolted along in a laborious fashion at the rate of about six miles an hour stopping at every roadside hovel
suddenly the cart pulled up
im expected
i pointed out to him that the rack was specially constructed for light luggage that a hat box was light luggage and that if the train jolted he ought to blame the company not me
be you going to stop with they wilsons
wellthereabouts
there was a great shadow which possibly did duty for a house but if so there was not a light in any of the windows and there was nothing visible in the shape of a door
i was beyond it
finally the hulking lad was dispatched
no doubt they would set him down as a lunatic right away
no references were offered or asked for
the drivers voice came from the background
be it all right
and yet from my boyhood upward i have desired to meet one here was an opportunity offered
all night it had been blowing and raining
do you think that you could manage tidy
still i felt that it could hardly be worse than a chop or cousin lucy the subjects of her conversation i never cared about when they were alive and i certainly do not want to talk about them now they are dead
if they know youre coming perhaps they hear and dont choose to answer
hard
im afraid i can offer you nothing to drink
after a few seconds interval the pit pat of what was obviously one pair of feet came towards the door
an oldfashioned christmas
i was chilled to the bone wet tired hungry
have you any luggage i admitted that i had
a voice inquired whos there
so i wrote to the advertiser
i think i had
i drove him over from the station miss
an oldfashioned christmasa lively family will accept a gentleman as paying guest to join them in spending an oldfashioned christmas in the heart of the country
on christmas eve the weather was abominable
i had not given a christmas present for yearsthere had been no one to give them to
there was nothing said about the sort of accommodation which would be provided nothing about the kind of establishment which was maintained or the table which was kept
again a light gleamed through the pane
of course i knew that i had no right to do anything of the kind and was aware that the chances were a hundred to one against my ever presuming to hint at its existence
the information was greeted with what sounded uncommonly like a chorus of laughter
so i had to cool my heels for two hours and a half in a wretched cowshed amidst a bitter whirling snowstorm
wheres another thing
chapter one
he was impervious to reason
there be a lot of luggage he do say hes come to stay with you
can i see mrs wilson
then i had to wait three quarters of an hour for a train to take me back again only to find that i had missed the one i intended to catch
we passed through a gate which i had to get down to open along some sort of avenue
i cant say rightly as how i should miss
i said i would go and i meant to go
what the lively family would think of a perfect stranger arriving burdened with rubbish as if he had known them all their lives i did not dare to think
it be about time as someone were to stay with them as were a bit capable like
no answer though i allowed a more than decent interval
better ring again suggested the driver
weve lost the key of the cellar and theres nothing out except water and i dont think youd care for that
hardly the sort of weather to start for an unknown destination in the heart of the country but at the last moment i did not like to back out
once more i suspected the driver of a chuckle
it had its points
if they have theres a bell on your right if it isnt broken
i hoped to goodness that he would not prove to be a hypochondriac like lucys husband
there was a trap at the boy and blunderbuss but that required fetching
the youngest member of the family might be twenty or the oldest ten
the promise
i am
the storm rushed in she put up her hand to shield the light from danger
the mare shell stand still enough
now it is a remarkable thing that i have always had an extraordinary predilection for the name madge
better ring again
i even bought something for madgei mean mrs wilson
the whole thing was a trifle odd
i tolled the bell again
why do you ask
that is a fact
still if you have not tried your hand at that kind of thing for ever so long the mere act of purchasing is a pleasure
that might be so
i went inside it was time
i might arrive it seemed on christmas eve but there was no hint as to when i was to go if ever
it appeared that the terms would be five guineas but there was no mention of the length of time which that fee would cover
after a vast amount of unfastening the door was opened and on the threshold there stood a girl with a lighted candle in her hand
i was not sure what in this case an oldfashioned christmas might happen to mean
i rang again and again with all the force i could
i had been idiot enough to load myself with a lot of christmas presents without the faintest notion why
his wrangling and jangling so upset me that i went past the station at which i ought to have changed
when at last i reached crofton my journeys end it turned out that the station staff consisted of a half witted individual who was stationmaster porter and clerk combined and a hulking lad who did whatever else there was to do
here we be
i looked at her she at me
i did not ask
perhaps it had better be brought in
i sounded another peal
as for the pills and drops with which her husband doses himself between the courses it makes me ill even to think of them
the trains were late and of course overcrowded there was enough luggage in our compartment to have filled it and still there was one more passenger than there ought to have been an ill conditioned old fellow who wanted my hat box put into the van because it happened to tumble off the rack on to his head
i felt quite lively myself as i mingled with the christmas crowd looking for things which might not turn out to be absolutely preposterous
i knew nothing of the people i was going to
the reply was written in a sprawling feminine hand
never shall i forget the drive in that miserable cart through the storm and those pitch black country lanes
maybe theyre up to some of their games and wants rousing
i am no dealer in poisons
the bell reverberated through what seemed like an empty house
it was a pity he did not add where here was
in the morning it began to freeze
i did not expect a princely entertainment
the whereabouts of this however the driver presently made clear
i may as well say at once what my after experience taught menamely that with all their faults and extraordinary obliquity of mental vision upon many subjects they are the very best bred people that i ever fell in with
he at length asked me a single short question which i supposed meant who are you i answered in english quite composedly as though he would understand me and endeavoured to be my very most natural self as well as i could
i expressed by signs my admiration and pleasure to my guides and they were greatly pleased
i never saw anything in the least comparable to them the women were vigorous and had a most majestic gait their heads being set upon their shoulders with a grace beyond all power of expression each feature was finished eyelids eyelashes and ears being almost invariably perfect
the larger specimens had a case to themselves and tickets with writing on them in a character which i could not understand
it was here as hitherto all things were generically the same as in europe the differences being of species only and i was amused at seeing in a window some bottles with barley sugar and sweetmeats for children as at home but the barley sugar was in plates not in twisted sticks and was coloured blue
in about four hours of walking from the time we started and after passing two or three more villages we came upon a considerable town and my guides made many attempts to make me understand something but i gathered no inkling of their meaning except that i need be under no apprehension of danger
the country was highly cultivated every ledge being planted with chestnuts walnuts and apple trees from which the apples were now gathering
they seemed concerned and uneasy as soon as they got hold of it
they felt my pulse they looked at my tongue they listened at my chest they felt all my muscles and at the end of each operation they looked at the chief and nodded and said something in a tone quite pleasant as though i were all right
when i had shown them what i did with it they were astonished but not displeased and seemed to like the smell
even in middle age they were still comely and the old grey haired women at their cottage doors had a dignity not to say majesty of their own
we passed many cases and at last came to one in which there were several clocks and two or three old watches
but by and by they came to my watch which i had hidden away in the inmost pocket that i had and had forgotten when they began their search
goats were abundant also a kind of small black cattle in the marshes near the river which was now fast widening and running between larger flats from which the hills receded more and more
as soon as it was ended they proceeded to overhaul my swag and the contents of my pockets
i could fill many pages with a description of their dress and the ornaments which they wore and a hundred details which struck me with all the force of novelty but i must not stay to do so
when we had got past the village the fog rose and revealed magnificent views of the snowy mountains and their nearer abutments while in front i could now and again catch glimpses of the great plains which i had surveyed on the preceding evening
i will spare the reader any description of the town and would only bid him think of domodossola or faido
these two were first called out and in about a quarter of an hour i was made to follow them which i did in some fear and with much curiosity
the village was just like the one we had left only rather larger
they even pulled down my eyelids and looked i suppose to see if they were bloodshot but it was not so
the men were as handsome as the women beautiful
chapter seven first impressions
lastly i should say that the people were of a physical beauty which was simply amazing
the children were infinite in number and exceedingly merry i need hardly say that they came in for their full share of the prevailing beauty
the design was different but the thing was clearly the same
in fact one of them was plainly very much out of health and coughed violently from time to time in spite of manifest efforts to suppress it
he spoke to me solemnly and sternly for two or three minutes
as i said before all were marred and broken
he appeared more and more puzzled and then retired returning with two others much like himself
my hosts always bowed their heads as they passed one of these shrines and it shocked me to see statues that had no apparent object beyond the chronicling of some unusual individual excellence or beauty receive so serious a homage
he looked me all over for about five minutes letting his eyes wander from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet up and down and down and up neither did his mind seem in the least clearer when he had done looking than when he began
here the magistrate stopped and opening the case began comparing my watch with the others
we followed an alpine path for some four miles now hundreds of feet above a brawling stream which descended from the glaciers and now nearly alongside it
their expression was divine and as they glanced at me timidly but with parted lips in great bewilderment i forgot all thoughts of their conversion in feelings that were far more earthly
glass was plentiful in the better houses
i have always delighted in and reverenced beauty but i felt simply abashed in the presence of such a splendid typea compound of all that is best in egyptian greek and italian
at least i fancied so but i soon found my mistake
the other looked pale and ill but he was marvellously selfcontained and it was impossible to say what was the matter with him
but it was not so
my guides spoke to many in passing and those spoken to showed much amazement
sometimes we went through forests of pine or rather yew trees though they looked like pine and i remember that now and again we passed a little wayside shrine wherein there would be a statue of great beauty representing some figure male or female in the very heyday of youth strength and beauty or of the most dignified maturity and old age
i remember that when they first found it i had thought of paley and how he tells us that a savage on seeing a watch would at once conclude that it was designed
the morning was cold and somewhat foggy for the autumn had made great strides latterly
however i showed no sign of wonder or disapproval for i remembered that to be all things to all men was one of the injunctions of the gentile apostle which for the present i should do well to heed
both of them appeared astonished at seeing one who was evidently a stranger but they were too ill to come up to me and form conclusions concerning me
i was dazzled as i saw one after the other of whom i could only feel that each was the loveliest i had ever seen
their colour was equal to that of the finest italian paintings being of the clearest olive and yet ruddy with a glow of perfect health
i saw a few sheep with rounded noses and enormous tails dogs were there in plenty and very english but i saw no cats nor indeed are these creatures known their place being supplied by a sort of small terrier
this gave me little uneasiness for i had no money with me nor anything which they were at all likely to want or which i cared about losing
on my return i purposely avoided looking into it until i had sent back my last revises to the printer
then i had much pleasure in reading it but was indeed surprised at the many little points of similarity between the two books in spite of their entire independence to one another
having now i fear at too great length done what i was asked to do i should like to add a few words on my own account
i have also parted with the word infortuniam though not without regret but have not dared to meddle with other similar inaccuracies
the next part of erewhon that i wrote was the world of the unborn a preliminary form of which was sent to mr holyoakes paper but as i cannot find it among those copies of the reasoner that are in the british museum i conclude that it was not accepted
this is a mistake though a perfectly natural one
the author wishes it to be understood that erewhon is pronounced as a word of three syllables all shortthus e re whon
june ninth eighteen seventy two
i also wrote about this time the substance of what ultimately became the musical banks and the trial of a man for being in a consumption
i had a telescope and a dog and would take bread and meat and tobacco with me starting with early dawn it would be night before i could complete my round for the mountain over which i had to go was very high
i would try the nearer range and see how far i could go
aha they see and rush towards each other
men pushed farther and farther into the mountains and found a very considerable tract inside the front range between it and another which was loftier still though even this was not the highest the great snowy one which could be seen from out upon the plains
even if i did not find country might i not find gold or diamonds or copper or silver
could i hope to cross it
alas they are both mistaken the ewe is not the lambs ewe they are neither kin nor kind to one another and part in coldness
i knew that there was a range still farther back but except from one place near the very top of my own mountain no part of it was visible from this point however i saw whenever there were no clouds a single snow clad peak many miles away and i should think about as high as any mountain in the world
the climate was temperate and very healthy there were no wild animals nor were the natives dangerous being few in number and of an intelligent tractable disposition
ah who could say
this would be the highest triumph that i could wish for but it was too much to think of yet
the colony was one which had not been opened up even to the most adventurous settlers for more than eight or nine years having been previously uninhabited save by a few tribes of savages who frequented the seaboard
wonderful
suffice it that when i left home it was with the intention of going to some new colony and either finding or even perhaps purchasing waste crown land suitable for cattle or sheep farming by which means i thought that i could better my fortunes more rapidly than in england
what they dealt in how they laboured to what end it all came she had only the vaguest conception
he seemed to be thinking of something else
she would get in one of the great shops and do well enough untilwell until something happened neither of them knew exactly what
she troubled herself over what else to put in the letter
anything was good enough so long as it paidsay five dollars a week to begin with
at about twenty minutes of five
in the interval which marked the preparation of the meal carrie found time to study the flat
then she walked and sang to it until hanson disturbed in his reading came and took it
his one observation to the point was concerning the chances of work in chicago
she read from the manner of hanson in the subdued air of minnie and indeed the whole atmosphere of the flat a settled opposition to anything save a conservative round of toil
chapter two
she was pleased to see her in a way but reflected her husbands point of view in the matter of work
youd better look in those big manufacturing houses along franklin street and just the other side of the river he concluded lots of girls work there
he was a silent man american born of a swede father and now employed as a cleaner of refrigerator cars at the stock yards
her husband asked a few questions and sat down to read the evening paper
these vast buildings what were they
it isnt very far
a shop girl was the destiny prefigured for the newcomer
i cannot have you call on me here
its a big place he said
it was on the third floor the front windows looking down into the street where at night the lights of grocery stores were shining and children were playing
ive got to get up early in the morning so ill go to bed and off he went disappearing into the dark little bedroom off the hall for the night
these strange energies and huge interests for what purposes were they there
no she said to herself he cant come here
what poverty threatened of granite and brass
well well go out sunday and see lincoln park
carrie noticed that hanson had said nothing to this
he could not come here
a pleasant side to his nature came out here he was patient
if hanson sat every evening in the front room and read his paper if he went to bed at nine and minnie a little later what would they expect of her
she had some slight gift of observation and that sense so rich in every womanintuition
they did not figure on promotion they did not exactly count on marriage
well she said i think ill look around to morrow
he arose from his chair and went and looked out into the street
by the time he reached his own street he was keenly alive to the difficulties of his situation and wished over and over that some solution would offer itself that he could see his way out
he looked at the little chap with a feeling of doubt
shut him out and make him pay
how much more pleasant it would be
he jangled it fiercely several times in succession but without avail
he would go up there and have it out with her thats what he would do
i saw a young girl up in that winder returned the cabby
she was carrying things with too high a hand
these were his first thoughts
he tore it open and read without a show of feeling
she would find out at once just what advantages she could gain
so this was the game was it
what could it mean
curse it
he was in a fevered state of mind owing to the blight his wifes action threatened to cast upon his entire future
hands were hidden in the pockets of the umbrellaless umbrellas were up
no answer
he thanked his stars that he did not have to confront that proposition just now when he needed to think so much
he saw no solution of anythingnot a loophole left
what a fool move that was
my friends too he grew more angry as he thought of the talk any action on her part would create
it was the one pleasing thing in this whole rout of trouble
later however his old discretion asserted itself
he knew her well enough to know that when she had decided upon a plan she would follow it up
he would have no row
if he could only get plenty of time to think perhaps something would turn up
he pulled out his key and tried to insert it but another key was on the inside
he began to wish that he had compromised in some way or otherthat he had sent the money
pedestrians had turned up collars and trousers at the bottom
he could arrange that satisfactorily for carrie would be glad to wait if necessary
he scarcely noticed the picture
finally seeing that no one was coming he turned and went back to his cab
now that she had practically cowed him she would follow up her work with demands the acknowledgment of which would make her word law in the future
he went in and examined his letters but there was nothing from carrie fortunately there was nothing from his wife either
his first impulse was to write but four words in replygo to the devilbut he compromised by telling the boy that there would be no reply
he alighted and went up the steps to the front door but it was with a nervous palpitation of the heart
she had not been able to get away this morning
he would have to pay her the money which she would now regularly demand or there would be trouble
what would she do about that
ashes of tinder a face at the window
i need it to carry out my plans
he walked the floor of his little office and later that of his room putting one thing and another together to no avail
hurstwood looked but there was no face there now
after a time he gave up waiting and drearily headed for the madison car to add to his distress the bright blue sky became overcast with little fleecy clouds which shut out the sun
that night hurstwood remained down town entirely going to the palmer house for a bed after his work was through
the confounded wretch
hurstwood walked the floor mentally arranging the chief points of his situation
he rang againthis time harder
then he sat down in his chair and gazed without seeing contemplating the result of his work
he walked the floor again pretending to be in an ordinary mood but secretly troubled beyond the expression of words
hurstwood recognised his wifes writing
he began to feel the appetite that had been wanting before he had reached the office and decided before going out to the park to meet carrie to drop in at the grand pacific and have a pot of coffee and some rolls
you can stay away if you want to
then he would take up his wifes threat again and the wrinkles and moisture would return
hed take it to herhe would go up there and have a talk with her and that at once
the audacity of the thing took his breath
he put on his hat and looked around for his umbrella
perhaps he could do it up here
he saw only her pretty face and neat figure and wondered why life was not arranged so that such joy as he found with her could be steadily maintained
on the way his temper cooled as he thought of the details of the case
could something have happened out there to keep her away
he would have to explain and deny and make a general mark of himself
what a fool trick that was
while he was not sure how much significance might be attached to the threat she had made he was sure that her attitude if long continued would cause him no end of trouble
he rang the bell and then waited
it roused his ire alsothe deepest element of revolt in him
he shook at the knob but the door was locked
im to bring an answer said the boy
his spirits fell however when upon reaching the park he waited and waited and carrie did not come
she was determined and had worsted him in a very important contest
ill make her change her tone if i have to use force to do it
damn her he said softly with his teeth firmly set ill make it hot for her if she causes me trouble
he also thought of his managerial position
could she have been reached by his wife
the street looked like a sea of round black cloth roofs twisting bobbing moving
so dont delay but send it by the boy
many little wrinkles gathered between his eyes as he contemplated this and his brow moistened
i know her
come what might he would adjust this matter and soon
there was no more to be done upon that score that night
he was altogether a fine example of great mental perturbation
suddenly he thought supposing she isnt out theresuppose she has gone
he saw that in the excitement of recent events he had not formulated a plan upon that score
he would plead until her anger would meltuntil she would forgive him
well he said after a time quite audibly i dont know
it was the worst sunday he had spent in his life
it read
hurry right back
he got back to his office and joined in a conversation with friends
the boy hastened away and the manager fell to his musings
to add to his misery there was no word from carrie
he really pined for a word and looked out upon her with his minds eye in the most wistful manner
she said it was high time
he would go to her and tell her all his family complications he would explain to her just where he stood and how much he needed her surely she couldnt go back on him now
he thought he would go out and insist on seeing her if she did not send him word of some sort soon
you take this to this address he said handing him the envelope and give it to mrs hurstwood
he stayed at his desk long after all others had gone and only quitted it when the night watchman on his round pulled at the front door to see if it was safely locked
yes sir said the boy
when hurstwood got back to his office again he was in a greater quandary than ever
ashes of tinder the loosing of stays
he could hardly realise how it had all come about
he could see her meeting the boy at the door and smiling sardonically
the hours slipped by and with them the possibility of the union he had contemplated
i guess not
if she isnt there bring it back
if he did he would be offered terms that would make his blood boil
he must get some speedier methodbut how
any answer
there was no use speculating over that
very truly yours etc
how about that now
then he folded it up and put it in his pocket
his absence did not seem to be noticed by either of his children
he breathed heavily and wiped the moisture from his face
for all his study nothing came of the evening except thishe sent the money
what could be the trouble in that quarter
one of the galling incidents of this visit was that he came back on a randolph street car and without noticing arrived almost opposite the building of the concern with which his son was connected
chapter twenty five
he had evidently delivered the package for as he came up he made no sign of taking anything out of his pocket
he had loved her earnestly enough but now that the possibility of losing her stared him in the face she seemed much more attractive
he was beaten for to night and he might just as well make the best of it
he strolled up and down the polished floor of the resort his hands in his pockets his brow wrinkled his mouth set
it wasnt possible
nevertheless his rousing availed him nothing
lord lord he thought what had he got into
that night he dined at rectors and returned at once to his office
she would take the envelope and know that she had triumphed
meanwhile he would have time to think
he drank more brandy and soda than he had any evening in months
he did manage to bring himself into the mood to go out to carrie but when he got in ogden place he thought he saw a man watching him and went away
hurstwood scowled fiercely
he decided to write her care of the west side post office and ask for an explanation as well as to have her meet him
it would be just like this to happen as things were going now meanwhile he had not sent the money
so here it was spread out clear before him and now he knew what to expect
he was quite certain now that she knew he was married and was angered at his perfidy
he was desperately in love and would have taken great chances to win her under ordinary circumstances but nownow what supposing she had found out something
he was really affected most miserably of all by this desertion
he read it through carefully several times and then merely shook his head
well well fortune plays a man queer tricks
in about an hour and three quarters the boy returned
youve seen my wife he asked as a precautionary measure as the boy turned to go
three oclock came four five six and no letter
nothing from his wife which was pleasant
any answer
he was getting some vague comfort out of a good cigar but it was no panacea for the ill which affected him
compromise exclaimed hurstwood bitterly
it seemed a monstrous unnatural unwarranted condition which had suddenly descended upon him without his let or hindrance
it seemed as if his family troubles were just beginning
well said hurstwood
no word from carrie
the fact that he had sent the money and that she had received it worked to the ease of his mind for as the thought that he had done it receded his chagrin at it grew less and his hope of peace more
every once in a while he would clinch his fingers and tap his footsigns of the stirring mental process he was undergoing
he did not propose to lose her whatever she might think
he did not go within a block of the house
no letter had come no word of any kind and yet here it was late in the evening and she had agreed to meet him that morning
meanwhile he gave a thought now and then to carrie
how could things have taken such a violent turn and so quickly
he folded the letter and put it with the other one
now he had done it
this sent a pang through his heart
if he didnt go and see them they would sue him promptly
my wife
but oh the wretchedness of being forced this way
yes sir
he wondered what the morning would bring forth and slept anything but soundly upon it
the thought that this letter would probably not reach her until monday chafed him exceedingly
yes sir
it was with great opposition after two or three hours of the most urgent mental affirmation and denial that at last he got an envelope placed in it the requested amount and slowly sealed it up
in the bustle and show of the latter was his only relief
next day he went again to the office and opened his mail suspicious and hopeful of its contents
all right now
he tried to get the interest of things about him but it was not to be
it was too much to think of and sit still
he was forced to take his feet
oh yes sir
i gave it to her
he fancied as he sat at his desk that nothing would be done for a week or two
he troubled over many little details and talked perfunctorily to everybody
on wednesday he received another polite note from mcgregor james and hay
through the kitchen to the parlor he said
his being was like an all sided lens concentrating all joys in the one heart of his consciousness
a little longer and she was compelled to yield and the silent tears flowed freely
a catastrophe
the music was broken and joseph left alone with the dumb instruments
letty finding herself not quite equal to the emergency came in her turn to call mary she went as quietly as if she were leaving a tiresome visitor
it cried aloud that eternity was very long and like a great palace without a quiet room
one winter evening as soon as his work was over for the day joseph locked the door of his smithy washed himself well put on clean clothes and taking his violin set out for testbridge mary was expecting him to tea
his violin was broken but his being was made whole his treasure takentype of his self and a woman given him instead
mary came halfway to meet him
it was the afternoon of a holiday and she had closed early
he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how shall he love god whom he hath not seen
letty too was overcomemore than ever she had been by music
a mood had taken shape in the mind of the blacksmith and wandered from its home seeking another country
it broke the enchantment in which joseph was bound
he stepped across the floor still stately and free
when he reached marys shop he turned into the court to the kitchen door
mary had not listened long before she found herself strangely moved her heart seemed to swell up into her throat and it was all she could do to keep from weeping
it prayed it wept it implored
when he reached the suburbs the light of homes was shining through curtains of all colors
its just like him he murmured
earth was gone and heaven was all
that enchantment had possessed him usurping as it were the throne of his life and displacing it when it ceased he was not his own master
how it happened he never could tell but he brought down his violin with a crash against the piano then somehow stumbled and all but fell
o my godthrough the mud of me up to thy righteousness
thus in a garment of mood whose color and texture was music did the soul of joseph jasper that evening like a homeless ghost come knocking at the door of mary marston
on the bough of an apple tree in the fair moonlight sat a nightingale swaying to and fro like one mad with the wine of his own music singing as if he wanted to break his heart and have done for the delight was too much for mortal creature to endure
his manner was much more considered and grave
this is your discharge from the palmetto guards he said
this was not the fashion of a year ago when they exchanged a friendly word or two but harry knew its cause
boats put out both from the fort and the shore
look out for what
he had little fear
but he saw nothing that moved there
people were cooler here and they were more prone to look at the two sides of a question
he was watching the boats
if youve got pistols just you think once before you shoot said collins
it was afternoon when he reached the little station of winton and left the train a tall sturdy boy the superior of many a man in size strength and agility
chapter seven
i shall look for you there
the very triumph and joy of living penetrated his soul youth swept aside the terrors of war
you were at the bombardment of fort sumter they tell me its made a mighty stir in these parts
harrys heart and judgment alike responded to the call
i will replied harry with vivid recollection of his ride from pendleton to winton
colonel kenton writes wisely
all the winds blew in the same direction in south carolina and they sang one song of triumph but in kentucky they were variable and conflicting and their voices were many
the story was enough too to make ones blood boil
i wouldnt give a halfpenny for the whole lot
he isnt fit to hear whats said here
theres no sale for it
i couldnt do anything with stevie that afternoon
it isnt his fault
he gets a red face poring over them
and mr ossipon brings every week a pile of these f p tracts to sell at a halfpenny each
he gets into his passions over it
mr verloc made no comment
we arent german slaves here thank god
the other day stevie got hold of one and there was a story in it of a german soldier officer tearing half off the ear of a recruit and nothing was done to him for it
he cant help being excitable
i wish he had never been to school mrs verloc began again brusquely hes always taking away those newspapers from the window to read
we dont get rid of a dozen numbers in a month
but whats the use of printing things like that
he glared at me as if he didnt know who i was when i went downstairs his heart was going like a hammer
he believes its all true
the brute
its silly readingthats what it is
my uncle and i came behind cutting a very tolerable figure upon our small but vigorous animals
chapter nine
it contains thirty thousand square miles of surface and has about seventy thousand inhabitants
three hours later still traveling over those apparently interminable and sandy prairies we were compelled to go round the kollafjord an easier and shorter cut than crossing the gulfs
a few stray cows and sheep were only seen occasionally
as there was nothing i liked better than horse exercise the pleasure of riding through an unknown country caused the early part of our enterprise to be particularly agreeable to me
the sweeping and broken waves came rolling in upon the pointed rocks the gulf was surrounded by rocky wallsa mighty cliff three thousand feet in height remarkable for its brown strata separated here and there by beds of tufa of a reddish hue
these sacred edifices are however very much like these people who do without watchesand never miss them
we took our way through poor and sparse meadows which made a desperate effort every year to show a little green
good beast good beast he would cry
it consists simply of a few housesnot what in england or germany we should call a hamlet
all this while we were advancing at a rapid pace
little did i expect however the spectacle which awaited us when we reached the peninsula of sneffels where agglomerations of natures ruins form a kind of terrible chaos
he moves so little that it is impossible for him to become fatigued
hans our extraordinary guide went first walking with a steady rapid unvarying step
he shared our frugal breakfast answered yes and no to my uncles questions as to the nature of the road and at last when asked where we were to pass the night was as laconic as usual
i began to enjoy the exhilarating delight of traveling a life of desire gratification and liberty
what a ferry boat
i thoroughly understood and appreciated the necessity for waiting before crossing the fjord for that moment when the sea at its highest point is in a state of slack water
hans on taking his departure from reykjavik had followed the line of the sea
the favorable moment did not come until six oclock in the evening
besides if he were to complain of weariness he could have the loan of my horse
there could be no doubt that this was all this terrible saknussemm had done
my uncle had not even the satisfaction of urging forward his steed by whip spur or voice
our horses however appeared not only well acquainted with the country but by a kind of instinct knew which was the best road
my uncle frowned stamped his feet and then followed the horses to where the boat lay
the rugged summits of the rocky hills were dimly visible on the edge of the horizon through the misty fogs every now and then some heavy flakes of snow showed conspicuous in the morning light while certain lofty and pointed rocks were first lost in the grey low clouds their summits clearly visible above like jagged reefs rising from a troublous sea
tidvatten said the guide
then my uncle myself and guide two boatmen and the four horses got into a very awkward flat bottom boat
accustomed as i had been to the steam ferry boats of the elbe i found the long oars of the boatmen but sorry means of locomotion
every now and then a spur of rock came down through the arid ground leaving us scarcely room to pass
if they are really intelligent i said to myself they will certainly not make the attempt
we must not however attempt to hurry him we must allow him to have his own way and i will undertake to say that between us we shall do our ten leagues a day
the weather was overcast but settled when we commenced our adventurous and perilous journey
why did you not say so before cried my uncle why not start at once
he dug his heels into the sides of his steed and made for the shore
all then that may be required of me i will do cheerfully and will create no difficulty
the country we had reached was already nearly a desert
it was in fact real tourist weather
look at hans
we were to learn this all in good time
our startwe meet with adventures by the way
what then must be the state of the less known and more distant parts of the island
they very rarely succeed in a good show of yellow
i should have a violent attack of the cramp if i were not to have some sort of exercise
der answered hans pointing to where lay the boat in questionthere
his horse went to the very edge of the water sniffed at the approaching wave and retreated
what does he say i asked considerably puzzled by the delay and the dialogue
we may do so was my reply but what about our worthy guide
we had neither to fear fatiguing heat nor drenching rain
i pointed this out to my uncle who made a very energetic grimace
my arms are rightbut my legs are getting a little stiff
he says tide replied my uncle translating the danish word for my information
snow tempest impracticable roads rocks icebergsnothing stops him
of course i understandwe must wait till the tide serves
but my uncle was in no humor to wait
our two horses with the luggage followed of their own accord without requiring whip or spur
at length the sturdy little pony spreading out his legs in a stiff and ludicrous attitude got from under the professors legs and left him standing with both feet on a separate stone like the colossus of rhodes
in reality the great volcanic movement of the island and all its attendant phenomena are concentrated in the interior of the island there horizontal layers or strata of rocks piled one upon the other eruptions of basaltic origin and streams of lava have given this country a kind of supernatural reputation
in this country there are no roads paths are nearly unknown and vegetation poor as it was slowly as it reached perfection soon obliterated all traces of the few travelers who passed from place to place
the truth is that my spirits rose so rapidly that i began to be indifferent to what had once appeared to be a terrible journey
he was about to make some energetic observation to the guide but hans without taking the slightest notice of him went in front of the horses and walked ahead with the same imperturbable phlegm he had always exhibited
he is brave he is sober he is safe he never makes a false step never glides or slips from his path
now whatever may have been the intelligence of our horses i had not the slightest reliance upon them as a means of crossing a stormy arm of the sea
in any case i shall trust rather to my own intelligence than theirs
to ride over salt water upon the back of a little horse seemed to me absurd
hans stopped here one half hour
what then must we expect when we come to the upheaved regionsto the districts broken and roughened from volcanic eruptions and subterraneous commotions
geographers have divided it into four parts and we had to cross the southwest quarter which in the vernacular is called sudvestr fjordungr
for bida asked my uncle
it was just before we left reykjavik that i came to this decision
a vast field of lava skirts it on one side falling away in terraces towards the sea
how the worse difficulty over i cried in fresh amazement
i saw but few inhabitants during my excursion but i met a crowd on the beach drying salting and loading codfish the principal article of exportation
they were now however absent on duty
from that moment the schooner was steered to the westward in order to round cape reykjanes the western point of iceland
after some hours we came in sight of a solitary rock in the ocean forming a mighty vault through which the foaming waves poured with intense fury
their costume consists of a coarse capote of black wool known in scandinavian countries as the vadmel a broad brimmed hat trousers of red serge and a piece of leather tied with strings for a shoea coarse kind of moccasin
here we are in iceland
as usual the crew was small five danes doing the whole of the work
upon an eminence close at hand was the national school in which were taught hebrew english french and danish
i had soon seen all i wanted of these weary and dismal thoroughfares here and there was a strip of discolored turf like an old worn out bit of woolen carpet and now and then a bit of kitchen garden in which grew potatoes cabbage and lettuce almost diminutive enough to suggest the idea of lilliput
we have only to go downbut as far as i am concerned that is not the question
the town lies on a flat and marshy plain between two hills
our voyage to iceland
her cargo was coal furniture pottery woolen clothing and a load of corn
i bore it very well but my uncle to his great annoyance and even shame was remarkably seasick
no trees no vegetation so to speakon all sides volcanic peaksthe huts of turf and earthmore like roofs than houses
i shall be glad to consult them
sometimes they gave vent to a convulsive laugh but by no chance did they smile
my uncle was delighted for myself moody and dissatisfied i appeared almost to expect a glimpse of the ghost of hamlet
in three hours my tour was complete
a few minutes afterwards the schooner started before the wind under all the canvas she could carry and entered the channel
you might perhaps even follow us to the centre of the earth there to resolve your eternal doubts
sublime madman thought i you doubtless would approve our proceedings
on the eleventh day we sighted cape portland over which towered mount myrdals yokul which the weather being clear we made out very readily the cape itself is nothing but a huge mount of granite standing naked and alone to meet the atlantic waves
in the meanwhile i replied i will take a walk through the town will you not likewise do so
though not very large it appeared not likely to be filled for centuries
that is the least part of the business and does not in any way trouble me
how long will the voyage last asked my uncle
then without further remark he put his finger to his lips frowned darkly and descended into the small boat which awaited us
well sir to a certain extent you are right
i have not the slightest doubt that in high winds its red tiles were blown out to the great annoyance of the pastor and congregation
i want to know how we are to get up again
out of three rooms of which his house was composed two were placed at our service and in a few hours we were installed with all our baggage the amount of which rather astonished the simple inhabitants of reykjavik
the men appeared robust but heavy fair haired like germans but of pensive mienexiles of a higher scale in the ladder of humanity than the eskimos but i thought much more unhappy since with superior perceptions they are compelled to live within the limits of the polar circle
in the centre of the new commercial street i found the public cemetery enclosed by an earthen wall
the castle of kronborg soon disappeared in the murky atmosphere as well as the tower of helsinborg which raises its head on the swedish bank and here the schooner began to feel in earnest the breezes of the kattegat
he was however but a civil servant a magistrate the governor of the islandbaron trampe
at all events we shall get there some day
what for me is curious in this island is not what is above the surface but what is below
the other street situated more to the west runs toward a little lake between the residences of the bishop and the other personages not engaged in commerce
well and have we a fair wind cried my uncle in his most mellifluous accents
chapter six
the voyage offered no incident worthy of record
the hour of departure came at last
i bowed by way of reply put on my hat and furred cloak and went out
my uncle came out of his cabin pale haggard thin but full of enthusiasm his eyes dilated with pleasure and satisfaction
nearly the whole population of the town was on foot to see us land
the fact is the castle is much later than the time of the heroic prince of denmark
i am about to visit the public library
but this power of discernment was denied them and only in after years with the loved ones of their own firesides close about them was the whole picture revealed
from the beginning minnetaki returned the young factors affections but a most potent reason prevented their marriage
there were now few lonely hours for the two boys
minnetaki herself replied to this ultimatum
in the end they came to an understanding
the country is alive with them and the government gives a bounty of fifteen dollars for every scalp taken two winters ago i killed forty and i did not make a business of it at that
had the young hunters the power of looking into the future their camp fire that night on the frozen ombabika might have been one of their last and a few days later would have seen them back on the edges of civilization
not until the eleventh did he arrive at sprucewood
those who were left moved to the vicinity of the post
if there is such a thing as love at first sight it sprang into existence the moment john newsomes eyes fell upon this lovely princess
we will hunt wolves
the feud still existed
it was accompanied by one from the factor himself another from the princess mother and by a tiny note from minnetaki who pleaded with the others that roderick and mrs drew might spend the winter with them at wabinosh house
we have everything here
the passing of each day became a painful task to him
on the tenth of october he would meet rod at sprucewood on the black sturgeon river
chapter two
yet if an enemy should honor us with a call his trust will not be misplaced and he will go away convinced that he has met with a royal host
the betrothal might or might not be discussed and approved by the parents but in either case it was customary for the young pair to disappear into the wilderness there to pass some days or weeks in perfect seclusion and dual solitude afterward returning to the village as man and wife
presently she returns to the camp carrying the mysterious the holy the dearest bundle
the remoter degrees of kinship were fully recognized and that not as a matter of form only first cousins were known as brothers and sisters the name of cousin constituted a binding claim and our rigid morality forbade marriage between cousins in any known degree or in other words within the clan
the ordeal is best met alone where no curious or pitying eyes embarrass her where all nature says to her spirit tis love
when she fell the whole race fell with her
it has been said that the position of woman is the test of civilization and that of our women was secure
here he throws handfuls of clear cold water into his face or plunges in bodily
at the age of about eight years if he is a boy she turns him over to his father for more spartan training
advancing years brought with them much freedom not only from the burden of laborious and dangerous tasks but from those restrictions of custom and etiquette which were religiously observed by all others
he wakes at daybreak puts on his moccasins and steps down to the waters edge
there was no priest to assume responsibility for anothers soul
early religious teaching
a soft low voice was considered an excellent thing in man as well as in woman
if a girl she is from this time much under the guardianship of her grandmother who is considered the most dignified protector for the maiden
silence and isolation are the rule of life for the expectant mother
all of the family property was held by her descent was traced in the maternal line and the honor of the house was in her hands
his respect for the immortal part of the animal his brother often leads him so far as to lay out the body of his game in state and decorate the head with symbolic paint or feathers
the very name of our tribe dakota means allied people
the family was not only the social unit but also the unit of government
in the old days our mothers were single eyed to the trust imposed upon them and as a noted chief of our people was wont to say men may slay one another but they can never overcome the woman for in the quietude of her lap lies the child
in them was vested our standard of morals and the purity of our blood
the indian was a religious man from his mothers womb
every act of his life is in a very real sense a religious act
his mate may precede or follow him in his devotions but never accompanies him
pre natal influence
the family altar
she continues her spiritual teaching at first silentlya mere pointing of the index finger to nature then in whispered songs bird like at morning and evening
friendship is held to be the severest test of character
he cuts off the choicest morsel of the meat and casts it into the firethe purest and most ethereal element
in due time the child takes of his own accord the attitude of prayer and speaks reverently of the powers
modesty was her chief adornment hence the younger women were usually silent and retiring but a woman who had attained to ripeness of years and wisdom or who had displayed notable courage in some emergency was sometimes invited to a seat in the council
she feels the endearing warmth of it and hears its soft breathing
and when the day of days in her life dawnsthe day in which there is to be a new life the miracle of whose making has been intrusted to her she seeks no human aid
indian names were either characteristic nicknames given in a playful spirit deed names birth names or such as have a religious and symbolic meaning
that is we believed the supreme duty of the parent who only was permitted to claim in some degree the priestly office and function since it is his creative and protecting power which alone approaches the solemn function of deity
a sioux prophet predicted the coming of the white man fully fifty years before the event and even described accurately his garments and weapons
it was quickly agreed by both parties that they should camp together for several days and one evening the sioux made a warriors feast to which they invited many of the ojibways
the attitude of the indian toward death the test and background of life is entirely consistent with his character and philosophy
death has no terrors for him he meets it with simplicity and perfect calm seeking only an honorable end as his last gift to his family and descendants
his family affections are strong and he grieves intensely for the lost even though he has unbounded faith in a spiritual companionship
at another time when i was fourteen years old we had just left fort ellis on the assiniboine river and my youngest uncle had selected a fine spot for our night camp
the father of little crow the chief who led the minnesota massacre of eighteen sixty two was another prophet of some note
some of us seemed to have a peculiar intuition for the locality of a grave which they explained by saying that they had received a communication from the spirit of the departed
occult and psychic powers
no doubt many predictions have been colored to suit the new age and unquestionably false prophets fakirs and conjurers have become the pest of the tribes during the transition period
they sent out scouts who soon returned with news of the approaching party
the response came in like manner and they entered the camp with the peace pipe in the hands of the prophet
the prophet asked his twin brother to sing one of his sacred songs and behold it was the very song that he himself was wont to sing
the outward signs of mourning for the dead are far more spontaneous and convincing than is the correct and well ordered black of civilization both men and women among us loosen their hair and cut it according to the degree of relationship or of devotion
the gift of prophecy
if one be dying at home it is customary to carry his bed out of doors as the end approaches that his spirit may pass under the open sky
death and funeral customs
at the end of a year from the time of death the relatives made a public feast and gave away the clothing and other gifts while the lock of hair was interred with appropriate ceremonies
the sacred lock of hair reincarnation and the converse of spirits
of course the outward signs of burial had been long since obliterated
this was carried out to the letter
on the border land of spirits
there are many trustworthy men and men of christian faith to vouch for these and similar events occurring as foretold
there was a wellknown sioux war prophet who lived in the middle of the last century so that he is still remembered by the old men of his band after he had reached middle age he declared that he had a spirit brother among the ojibways the ancestral enemies of the sioux
one of his characteristic prophecies was made only a few years before he died when he had declared that although already an old man he would go once more upon the war path
this child lived to become great among us as was intimated to the superstitious by the circumstances of his birth
this incident made a great impression upon our people
finally the wailing for the dead is continued night and day to the point of utter voicelessness a musical weird and heart piercing sound which has been compared to the keening of the celtic mourner
certainly the indian never doubted the immortal nature of the spirit or soul of man but neither did he care to speculate upon its probable state or condition in a future life
the tree the waterfall the grizzly bear each is an embodied force and as such an object of reverence
the worship of the great mystery was silent solitary free from all self seeking
they spoke much of spiritual things while seeking only the material
our faith might not be formulated in creeds nor forced upon any who were unwilling to receive it hence there was no preaching proselyting nor persecution neither were there any scoffers or atheists
the elements and majestic forces in nature lightning wind water fire and frost were regarded with awe as spiritual powers but always secondary and intermediate in character
having first prepared himself by means of the purifying vapor bath and cast off as far as possible all human or fleshly influences the young man sought out the noblest height the most commanding summit in all the surrounding region
it was silent because all speech is of necessity feeble and imperfect therefore the souls of my ancestors ascended to god in wordless adoration
we believed that the spirit pervades all creation and that every creature possesses a soul in some degree though not necessarily a soul conscious of itself
the native american has been generally despised by his white conquerors for his poverty and simplicity
it was clear to him that virtue and happiness are independent of these things if not incompatible with them
among us all men were created sons of god and stood erect as conscious of their divinity
the indian loved to come into sympathy and spiritual communion with his brothers of the animal kingdom whose inarticulate souls had for him something of the sinless purity that we attribute to the innocent and irresponsible child
to him as to other single minded men in every age and race from diogenes to the brothers of saint francis from the montanists to the shakers the love of possessions has appeared a snare and the burdens of a complex society a source of needless peril and temptation
the first is pure spirit concerned only with the essence of things and it was this he sought to strengthen by spiritual prayer during which the body is subdued by fasting and hardship
but it was not so easy to overlook or to excuse national bad faith
it was not then wholly from ignorance or improvidence that he failed to establish permanent towns and to develop a material civilization to the untutored sage the concentration of population was the prolific mother of all evils moral no less than physical
this is the material or physical prayer
he had faith in their instincts as in a mysterious wisdom given from above and while he humbly accepted the supposedly voluntary sacrifice of their bodies to preserve his own he paid homage to their spirits in prescribed prayers and offerings
the savage philosopher
of the vision or sign vouchsafed to him he did not speak unless it had included some commission which must be publicly fulfilled sometimes an old man standing upon the brink of eternity might reveal to a chosen few the oracle of his long past youth
it was solitary because they believed that he is nearer to us in solitude and there were no priests authorized to come between a man and his maker
the lust for money power and conquest so characteristic of the anglo saxon race did not escape moral condemnation at the hands of his untutored judge nor did he fail to contrast this conspicuous trait of the dominant race with the spirit of the meek and lowly jesus
not only did they not profess it but they stooped so low as to insult their god with profane and sacrilegious speech
in his own thought he rose superior to them
the paradox of christian civilization
with his limited knowledge of cause and effect he saw miracles on every handthe miracle of life in seed and egg the miracle of death in lightning flash and in the swelling deep nothing of the marvelous could astonish him as that a beast should speak or the sun stand still
the original attitude of the american indian toward the eternal the great mystery that surrounds and embraces us was as simple as it was exalted
to him it was the supreme conception bringing with it the fullest measure of joy and satisfaction possible in this life
to him it appeared shocking and almost incredible that there were among this people who claimed superiority many irreligious who did not even pretend to profess the national faith
yet the religion that is preached in our churches and practiced by our congregations with its element of display and self aggrandizement its active proselytism and its open contempt of all religions but its own was for a long time extremely repellent
in this type of prayer there was no beseeching of favor or help
none might exhort or confess or in any way meddle with the religious experience of another
from the sun as the universal father proceeds the quickening principle in nature and in the patient and fruitful womb of our mother the earth are hidden embryos of plants and men
at the solemn hour of sunrise or sunset he took up his position overlooking the glories of earth and facing the great mystery and there he remained naked erect silent and motionless exposed to the elements and forces of his arming for a night and a day to two days and nights but rarely longer
solitary worship
who may condemn his superstition
we have still to face the ultimate miraclethe origin and principle of life
all who have lived much out of doors know that there is a magnetic and nervous force that accumulates in solitude and that is quickly dissipated by life in a crowd and even his enemies have recognized the fact that for a certain innate power and self poise wholly independent of circumstances the american indian is unsurpassed among men
he might in time come to recognize that the drunkards and licentious among white men with whom he too frequently came in contact were condemned by the white mans religion as well and must not be held to discredit it
being a natural man the indian was intensely poetical
the indian was a logical and clear thinker upon matters within the scope of his understanding but he had not yet charted the vast field of nature or expressed her wonders in terms of science
surely not the devout catholic or even protestant missionary who teaches bible miracles as literal fact the logical man must either deny all miracles or none and our american indian myths and hero stories are perhaps in themselves quite as credible as those of the hebrews of old
the sun shines freely into its mouth and graceful bunches of grass and eriogonums and sage grow about it doing what they can toward its redemption from degrading associations and making it beautiful
probably ninety nine per cent of it is at once absorbed and drained away beneath the porous lava folds of the mountain to gush forth filtered and pure in the form of immense springs so large some of them that they give birth to rivers that start on their journey beneath the sun full grown and perfect without any childhood
every landscape low and high seems doomed to be trampled and harried
that any kind of plant can hold on and grow beneath the wear of so boisterous a current seems truly wonderful even after taking into consideration the freedom of the water from cutting drift and the constance of its volume and temperature throughout the year
it comes in a grand eager gush from a horizontal seam in the face of the wall of the river gorge in the form of a partially interrupted sheet nearly seventy five yards in width and at a height above the riverbed of about forty feet as nearly as i could make out without the means of exact measurement
from year to year in the kindly weather the beds are thus gathering beautybeauty for ashes
the way lies by mount bremer over stretches of gray sage plains interrupted by rough lava slopes timbered with juniper and yellow pine and with here and there a green meadow and a stream
the poor fellows that lie here deserve far more pity than they have ever received
then you are free to make wide waverings and zigzags away from the roads to visit the great fountain streams of the rivers the glaciers also and the wildest retreats in the primeval forests where the best plants and animals dwell and where many a flower bell will ring against your knees and friendly trees will reach out their fronded branches and touch you as you pass
its waters apparently unaffected by flood or drouth heat or cold fall at once into white rapids with a rush and dash as if glad to escape from the darkness to begin their wild course down the canyon to the plain
only a little food will be required
here too you may find the curious but unlovable darlingtonia a carnivorous plant that devours bumblebees grasshoppers ants moths and other insects with insatiable appetite
the surface though smooth in a general way as seen from a distance is dotted with hillocks and rough crater like pits and traversed by a network of yawning fissures forming a combination of topographical conditions of very striking character
it measures twenty five or thirty feet in diameter at the entrance and extends but a short distance in a horizontal direction
berries and plums abound in season and quail and grouse and deerthe magnificent shaggy mule deer as well as the common species
but shasta is always at home to those who love her and is ever in a thrill of enthusiastic activityburning fires within grinding glaciers without and fountains ever flowing
beneath dim aisles in odorous beds the slight linnaea hang its twin born heads and bless the monument of the man of flowers which breathes his sweet fame through the northern bowers
a thousand thousand voices are heard but so finely blended they seem a part of the night itself and make a deeper silence
here you trace yawning fissures there clusters of somber pits now you mark where the lava is bent and corrugated in swelling ridges and domes again where it breaks into a rough mass of loose blocks
the banks are fringed with rubus rose plum cherry spiraea azalea honeysuckle hawthorn ash alder elder aster goldenrod beautiful grasses sedges rushes mosses and ferns with fronds as large as the leaves of palmsall in the midst of a richly forested landscape
then darkness like death
miles of its flanks are dotted with hot springs many of them so sulphurous and boisterous and noisy in their boiling that they seem inclined to become geysers like those of the yellowstone
yosemite was not held for a single day against the pursuing troops but the modocs held their fort for months until weary of being hemmed in they chose to withdraw
but neither the glorified woods on the one hand nor the lake on the other could at first hold the eye
this is a graveyard where lie buried thirty soldiers most of whom met their fate out in the lava beds as we learn by the boards marking the gravesa gloomy place to die in and deadly looking even without modocs
as you sweep around so grand a center the mountain itself seems to turn displaying its riches like the revolving pyramids in jewelers windows
here you are looking southeastward and the modoc landscape which at once takes possession of you lies revealed in front
captain jacks cave is one of the many somber cells of the castle
nowhere within the limits of california are the forests of yellow pine so extensive and exclusive as on the headwaters of the pitt
one blanket will be enough to carry or you may forego the pleasure and burden altogether as wood for fires is everywhere abundant
these volcanic caves are not wanting in interest and it is well to light a pitch pine torch and take a walk in these dark ways of the underworld whenever opportunity offers if for no other reason to see with new appreciation on returning to the sunshine the beauties that lie so thick about us
the vivid green of the boulders beneath the water is very striking and colors the entire stream with the exception of the portions broken into foam
next morning the crisp sunshiny air made even the modoc landscape less hopeless and we ventured down the bluff to the edge of the lava beds just at the foot of the bluff we came to a square enclosed by a stone wall
the full grown bucks weigh nearly three hundred and fifty pounds
the ducks less wary kept their places merely swimming in and out through openings in the rushes rippling the glassy water and raising spangles in their wake
far the most beautiful and richly furnished of the mountain caves of california occur in a thick belt of metamorphic limestone that is pretty generally developed along the western flank of the sierra from the mccloud river to the kaweah a distance of nearly four hundred miles
perhaps the profession of doing good may be full but every body should be kind at least to himself
food may be had at moderate intervals and the whole circuit forms one ever deepening broadening stream of enjoyment
fall river is a very remarkable stream
the walls in many places overhang in others they are beveled loose and shifting where the channel has been eroded by cinders ashes strata of firm lavas and glacial drift telling of many a change from frost to fire and their attendant floods of mud and water
when i first stood there one bright day before sundown the lake was fairly blooming in purple light and was so responsive to the sky in both calmness and color it seemed itself a sky
large flocks dwell here from year to year winter and summer descending occasionally into the adjacent sage plains and lava beds to feed but ever ready to take refuge in the jagged crags of their mountain at every alarm
take a course of good water and air and in the eternal youth of nature you may renew your own
that dark mysterious lava plain between them compelled attention
the neighboring trees look into the charmed circle as if the noon of another day had come familiar flowers and grasses that chance to be near seem far more beautiful and impressive than by day and as the dead trees give forth their light all the other riches of their lives seem to be set free and with the rejoicing flames rise again to the sky
the long gray slopes leading up to the glacier seem remarkably smooth and unbroken
here you strike the old emigrant road which leads over the low divide to the eastern slopes of the mountain
even the sky is not safe from scathblurred and blackened whole summers together with the smoke of fires that devour the woods
it is three or four miles long and terminates at an elevation of about nine thousand five hundred feet above sea level in moraine sprinkled ice cliffs sixty feet high
it is only about ten miles long and is composed of springs rapids and fallssprings beautifully shaded at one end of it a showy fall one hundred and eighty feet high at the other and a rush of crystal rapids between
the view obtained of the whitney glacier should tempt you to visit it since it is the largest of the shasta glaciers and its lower portion abounds in beautiful and interesting cascades and crevasses
the color is chiefly due to a species of algae which seems common in springs of this sort
their long massive ears give them a very striking appearance
it is a mass of lava presenting to the gray sage plain of shasta valley a bold craggy front two thousand feet high
how far destruction may go it is not easy to guess
the mule deer are nearly as heavy
then the shining of the wet leaves is delightful and the steamy fragrance and the burst of bird song from a multitude of thrushes and finches and warblers that have nests in the chaparral
the gorge through which the glacier is drained is raw looking deep and narrow and indescribably jagged
the floor is littered with the bones of the animals slaughtered for food during the war
no mountain shore hides its loveliness
under certain conditions you may hear the roar of the water rushing from the rock at a distance of half a mile or even more or you may not hear it until within a few rods
to judge from the few i have seen modocs are not very amiable looking people at best
the lofty icy shasta towering high above all seems but an hours walk from you though the distance in an air line is about sixty miles
tufts of grass grow far apart here and there and small bushes of hardy sage but they have a singed appearance and can do little to hide the blackness
they are a portion of a flow of dense black vesicular lava dipping northeastward at a low angle but little changed as yet by the weather and about as destitute of soil as a glacial pavement
the temperature is about forty five degrees and the height of the river above the sea is here about three thousand feet
and the wandering winds how busy they are and what a breadth of sound and motion they make glinting and bubbling about the crags of the summit sifting through the woods feeling their way from grove to grove ruffling the loose hair on the shoulders of the bears fanning and rocking young birds in their cradles making a trumpet of every corolla and carrying their fragrance around the world
thus the shasta river issues from a large lake like spring in shasta valley and about two thirds of the volume of the mccloud gushes forth in a grand spring on the east side of the mountain a few miles back from its immediate base
in approaching it its suspicious looking yellow spotted hood and watchful attitude will be likely to make you go cautiously through the bog where it stands as if you were approaching a dangerous snake
when therefore they were crawling stealthily in the gloomy caverns unkempt and begrimed and with the glare of war in their eyes they must have seemed very demons of the volcanic pit
the big meadows lie near the foot of lassens butte a beautiful spacious basin set in the heart of the richly forested mountains scarcely surpassed in the grandeur of its surroundings by tahoe
tracing this wild changing channel gorge gully or canyon the sections will show mount shasta as a huge palimpsest containing the records layer upon layer of strangely contrasted events in its fiery icy history
they cover the mountains and all the lower slopes that border the wide open valleys which abound there pressing forward in imposing ranks seemingly the hardiest and most firmly established of all the northern coniferae
the nights too are delightful watching with shasta beneath the great starry dome
the great wilds of our country once held to be boundless and inexhaustible are being rapidly invaded and overrun in every direction and everything destructible in them is being destroyed
it lies wide open for many a mile veiled in no mystery but the mystery of light
only a very small portion of the water derived from the melting ice and snow of shasta flows down its flanks on the surface
while traveling with a company of hunters i saw about fifty in one flock
and how grandly do the great logs and branches of your campfire give forth the heat and light that during their long century lives they have so slowly gathered from the sun storing it away in beautiful dotted cells and beads of amber gum
indians usually choose to hide in tall grass and bush and behind trees where they can crouch and glide like panthers without casting up defenses that would betray their positions but the modoc castle is in the rock
deadly was the task of storming such a place
one of the largest that i measured forms a lakelet nearly a hundred yards in diameter and in the generous flood it sends forth offers one of the most telling symbols of natures affluence to be found in the mountains
arctic beauty and desolation with their blessings and dangers all may be found here to test the endurance and skill of adventurous climbers but far better than climbing the mountain is going around its warm fertile base enjoying its bounties like a bee circling around a bank of flowers
yet strange to say there are days even here somewhat dull looking when the mountain seems uncommunicative sending out no appreciable invitation as if not at home
other castles scarcely less strong are connected with this by subterranean passages known only to the indians while the unnatural blackness of the rock out of which nature has constructed these defenses and the weird inhuman physiognomy of the whole region are well calculated to inspire terror
one large buck that i measured stood three feet and seven inches high at the shoulders and when the ears were extended horizontally the distance across from tip to tip was two feet and one inch
the forest also was flooded with sun purple not a spire moving and mount shasta was seen towering above it rejoicing in the ineffable beauty of the alpenglow
some have strange morbid fears as soon as they find themselves with nature even in the kindest and wildest of her solitudes like very sick children afraid of their motheras if god were dead and the devil were king
this is where general canby was slain while seeking to make peace with the treacherous modocs
muirs peak a few miles to the north of the spring rises about three thousand feet above the plain on which it stands and is easily climbed the view is very fine and well repays the slight walk to its summit from which much of your way about the mountain may be studied and chosen
sheep rock is about twenty miles from sissons and is one of the principal winter pasture grounds of the wild sheep from which it takes its name
during the glacial period it was a mer de glace then a lake and now a level meadow shining with bountiful springs and streams
but it is far better to go afoot
it is lined with emerald algae and mosses and shaded with alder willow and thorn bushes which give it a fine setting
these with a few others as yet nameless are lingering remnants of once great glaciers that occupied the canyons now taken by the rivers and in a few centuries will under present conditions vanish altogether
should the volume of the stream where you strike it seem small then you will know that you are above the spring if large nearly equal to its volume at its confluence with the pitt river then you are below it and in either case have only to follow the river up or down until you come to it
the rivers of the granite south half of the sierra are outspread on the peaks in a shining network of small branches that divide again and again into small dribbling purling oozing threads drawing their sources from the snow and ice of the surface
the shasta region is still a fresh unspoiled wilderness accessible and available for travelers of every kind and degree
only half a dozen sheep were shot as they passed the hunters stationed near their paths circling round the rugged summit
would it not then be a fine thing to set it apart like the yellowstone and yosemite as a national park for the welfare and benefit of all mankind preserving its fountains and forests and all its glad life in primeval beauty very little of the region can ever be more valuable for any other usecertainly not for gold nor for grain
this may be done by keeping well down on the base until fronting the glacier before beginning the ascent
the volcanic region about lassens butte i have already in part described
in the number and size of its big spring fountains it excels even shasta
on our return keeping close along shore we caused a noisy plashing and beating of wings among cranes and geese
one glacier after another comes into view and the outlines of the mountain are ever changing though all the way around from whatever point of view the form is maintained of a grand simple cone with a gently sloping base and rugged crumbling ridges separating the glaciers and the snowfields more or less completely
this is one of the few places in california where the charming linnaea is found though it is common to the northward through oregon and washington
mount bremer is the most noted stronghold of the sheep in the whole shasta region
but look well to your footing for the way will test the skill of the most cautious mountaineers
the distance is about a hundred miles and will take some of the time we hear so much abouta week or twobut the benefits will compensate for any number of weeks
tracing rivers to their fountains makes the most charming of travels as the life blood of the landscapes the best of the wilderness comes to their banks and not one dull passage is found in all their eventful histories
they were familiar with byways both over and under ground and could at any time sink suddenly out of sight like squirrels among the loose boulders
this is a famous game region and you will be likely to meet small bands of antelope mule deer and wild sheep
two or three miles farther on is the main stronghold of the modocs held by them so long and defiantly against all the soldiers that could be brought to the attack
on smooth spots level or ascending the hounds gained on the sheep but on descending ground and over rough masses of angular rocks they fell hopelessly behind
slight rainstorms are likely to be encountered in a trip round the mountain but one may easily find shelter beneath well thatched trees that shed the rain like a roof
then fell the gloaming making everything still more forbidding and mysterious
she ceased as the king spoke his livid lips did not move and there was no recognition in his glassy eyes
quickkill me before they can trap my soul for ever
do you not know me
brother cried yasmina catching his limp hand in a convulsive grasp i am here
the first speaker favored him with a long searching stare
her voice died at the utter vacancy of his face
i whom the kshatriyas know as kerim shah a prince from iranistan am no greater a masquerader than most men
yes
my sister where are you
my soul clings to my body but its hold weakens
on the dais under the golden dome the king cried out again racked by awful paroxysms
your cry and the grip of your fingers brought me back but i am going fast
aid me
the slant of the moon presaged evil for the king of vendhya the stars are in turmoil the serpent in the house of the elephant
swift he gasped and his weakening voice was rational
even the arts you call sorcery are governed by cosmic laws answered the man in the green turban
only a lock of hair murmured the nobleman
swiftly i command you there was the old imperious note in his failing whisper
all is darkness and the roaring of great winds
you have never disobeyed meobey my last command send my soul clean to asura
i do not know if you are a man or a demon khemsa he said at last few of us are what we seem
and i the black seers of yimsha said khemsa and my masters are greater than yours for they have accomplished by their arts what yezdigerd could not with a hundred thousand swords
do you mean that lock of bhunda chands hair
in another part of the city a man stood in a latticed balcony overlooking a long street in which torches tossed luridly smokily revealing upturned dark faces and the whites of gleaming eyes
the priests of asura have a dim inkling of this truth and so all nail trimmings hair and other waste products of the persons of the royal family are carefully reduced to ashes and the ashes hidden
he stiffened and then went limp a grim smile curving his dead lips
there they strove to break the silver cord of life and thrust my soul into the body of a foul night weird their sorcery summoned up from hell
i have been on a far journey and i understand
all discarded portions of the human body still remain part of it attached to it by intangible connections
the people know he will never see another dawn this man answered
nay he dies and none can say why
a low confused moan waned from his mouth
the people of the black circle
i can not find you
outside the moan of the tortured thousands shuddered up to the stars which crusted the sweating vendhyan night and the conchs bellowed like oxen in pain
when my masters decided upon his doom the lock in its golden jewel encrusted case was stolen from under her pillow while she slept and another substituted so like the first that she never knew the difference
the slave girls at the foot of the dais whimpered with fear and yasmina beat her breast in anguish
the man shrugged his broad shoulders and turned back into the arabesque chamber
one death strikes a king
but the glassy blankness passed from his eyes like smoke blown from a fire and he looked up at his sister with recognition
a long drawn wailing rose from the multitude
beads of sweat glistened on his dark skin his fingers twisted the gold worked fabric beneath him
if they have slain the king now why could they not have slain him months ago
the nobleman studied him curiously
she threw up her head in a gusty gesture of wrath and despair as the thunder of the distant drums reached her ears
all the noble born fighting men of ayodhya were gathered in the great palace or about it and at each broad arched gate and door fifty archers stood on guard with bows in their hands
strike i command you
they seek to snap the silver cord that binds me to my dying body
since his birth he has been guarded so closely that the cleverest poisoners of the east could not reach him
i tell you it is not poison she cried
not until the heavens were in the proper order could they perform this necromancy with a long stained fingernail he mapped the constellations on the marble tiled floor
brother she sobbed
the stars direct these actions as in other affairs
this man was clad in a brown camel hair robe and sandals and a green turban was on his head his expression was tranquil his gaze impersonal
their fingers sear me like fire
then the genuine lock travelled by camel caravan up the long long road to peshkhauri thence up the zhaibar pass until it reached the hands of those for whom it was intended
sobbing wildly yasmina plucked a jeweled dagger from her girdle and plunged it to the hilt in his breast
the priests and their clamor she exclaimed
a path is opened in the unseen realms and once a point of contact was established mighty powers were put in play along that path
i cannot she wailed smiting her naked breasts
he was young no spear had touched him no poison lurked in his wine
there at least i have no doubts for i serve king yezdigerd of turan
i am far from my mortal house
i know now what brings me to the pyre
haste lest you damn me to spend eternity as a filthy gaunt of darkness
five skulls bleaching on the tower of the kites can testify to attempts which were madeand which failed
he was a tall man compactly built and richly clad
point of contact inquired the other
he is dying nowand i stand here helpless who would burn the whole city and spill the blood of thousands to save him
not even my masters can alter the stars
ah i feel their pull upon me now
through the hot stifling night the temple gongs boomed and the conchs roared
but his voice rose in an eery call indistinct and far away as if called to her from beyond vast wind blown gulfs
the king is not yet dead but the dirge is sounded he said to another man who sat cross legged on a mat in a corner
by which a soul is drawn from its body and across gulfs of echoing space returned the man on the mat
so i believe i shall go back at least for a while and see what i can do
the terran public wanted to hear about martians and if live martians couldnt be found a room full of dead ones was the next best thing
but i think its important that one of us go back to present the story of our work and what we have accomplished and what we hope to accomplish to the public and to the universities and the learned societies and to the federation government
well forget it i dont care if bill chandlers found a three headed hippopotamus
lectures
what a question
martha and selim were working in the museum on the second floor scrubbing the grime from the glass cases noting contents and grease penciling numbers lattimer and a couple of space force officers were going through what had been the administrative offices on the other side
thats where they are
well of course theyre dead
degrees honors the deference of the learned and the adulation of the lay public
they look like skeletons covered with leather
he and ivan fitzgerald skinned and mounted it and then dissected the carcass almost tissue by tissue
positions with impressive titles and salaries
the center of the room was filled by a long table in armchairs around it sat the eighteen men and women who had occupied the room for the last fifty millennia
at least it was a something with wings and what were almost but not quite feathers though it was more reptilian than avian in general characteristics
let the infantry do the slogging through the mud the brass hats got the medals
sid dont you get it
little room back of one of the old faculty officesconference room
about seven eighths of its body capacity was lungs it certainly breathed air containing at least half enough oxygen to support human life or five times as much as the air around kukan
without question he had become overnight the most widely known archaeologist in history
isnt this something lattimer was exulting
in nineteen twenty three
they must have been all that were left here
shortly afterward the malady turned into a mild fever from which she recovered
now it was burned away at both sides and lay still hot along the edges on the floor of the big office room in front a floodlight was on in the room inside and lattimer was going around looking at things while a space force officer stood by the door
she crushed out her cigarette and got to her feet
braziers made of perforated two gallon odd metal cans the white walls smudged with smoke above them
dozen and a half of them
we must not allow the other scientific fields and the socalled practical interests to monopolize public and academic support
von ohlmhorst had noticed them at once and was poking into one of them with his flashlight
bring it to the public attention dramatize it
thats why you had so much trouble breaking in theyd sealed the room on the inside he straightened and went around the room until he found a ventilator and peered into it
fitzgerald was still trying to find out how the germ had been transmitted
not that im interested in all this for myself he disclaimed after listening to the telecast from terra two days after his discovery
no i do not know what they died of
skeletons covered with leather gloria standish had called them and so they werefaces like skulls arms and legs like sticks the flesh shrunken onto the bones under it
dr von ohlmhorst he was shouting
four hundred miles from kukan and at fifteen thousand feet lower altitude he shot a bird
mass suicide thats what it was
yes charcoal
immediately sid chamberlain and gloria standish began giving their telecasts a kukan dateline and hubert penrose used the name in his official reports
the discovery of the university had focused attention on the dead past of mars now the public was interested in mars as a possible home for humanity
the organization of a society of martian archaeology with anthony lattimer p h d the logical candidate for the chair
she slammed the phone back on its hook rushing away ahead of them
where they asked together
it was tony lattimer who brought archaeology back into the activities of the expedition and the news at home
another had fallen forward onto the table arms extended the emerald set of a ring twinkling dully on one finger
the civilian specialists in other fields and the space force people who had been holding tape lines and making sketches and snapping cameras were all flying to lower syrtis to find out how much oxygen there was and what kind of life it supported
they located the city and learned that its name had been kukanor something with a similar vowel consonant ratio
martha remembered the closed door on the first survey they hadnt attempted opening it
sid and gloria made the most of it
gloria standish who had dropped in for lunch was on the mezzanine fairly screaming into a radiophone extension
notice whats in the corners
over on the north side the lieutenant took hold of himself and spoke more deliberately
selim dropped his rag back in the bucket she laid her clipboard on top of the case beside her
eighteen of them around a long table
hey martha
maybe an even better thing it had been only sixty odd years since the orson welles invasion scare
id hoped it would be you your voice would carry the most weight
so they just came in here and lit the charcoal and sat drinking together till they all fell asleep
the high point came when one party at thirty thousand feet below the level of kukan found breathable air
it was one of these a young second lieutenant who came hurrying in from the mezzanine almost bursting with excitement
sweet are the uses of publicity
nobody else seemed to have caught it
sometimes sachiko dropped in most of the time she was busy helping ivan fitzgerald dissect specimens
and for a while it was easier to get financial support for new excavations
that took the center of interest away from archaeology and started a new burst of activity
the daily newscasts from terra showed a corresponding shift in interest at home
male or female human or animal
bud barclay a dark haired young flier and tom swift jrs closest friend chuckled
then tom who had been stunned by some falling debris raised himself to a sitting position
bud threw up his arms to protect himself but too late
suddenly tom stiffened in fear
tom nodded unhappily
mr swifts eyes twinkled
dazed and panic stricken survivors were wandering around aimlessly or rushing about to assist the injured
tough break tom sympathized
his friends eyelids flickered
i was all set for sandys cool soothing touch on my fevered brow
anyhow we want to help
a visitor tom looked at his father
a pity
as you know tom mr faber began the usual conditions of rocket flight will be
lets see about getting help for mr faber
with a desperate heave he shoved the beam away then cradled buds head in his arm
sandy to take her brothers mind off the disaster said dad tell tom and bud about the visitor whos coming
right where we landed our whirling duck
the scientist seemed to be badly injured
the answer came in a groan
look tom pointed to a huge crevasse
wow
why did you have to go and spoil it he complained jokingly
or grazed at least tom added thankfully
why one of the ambulance doctors checked us out
bud seized a slender steel i beam and managed to pry up the wreckage while tom carefully extricated mr faber
the helicopter arrived within twenty minutes at the place tom had named after landing at enterprises the boys drove to the pleasant tree shaded swift home on the outskirts of town
what a relief sandy gasped
the walls and roof were shuddering and creaking and the concrete floor was heaving under their feet
electronic equipment cascaded from the wall shelves and a heavy duty chain hoist came loose from its overhead track plunging to the floor with a terrifying crash
mr faber is badly injured tom said
from a pay telephone he called swift enterprises in shopton
within minutes tom was in charge of clearing away rubble and extricating anyone who might be trapped inside the buildings bud organized a fire fighting crew to keep the blaze in the shed from spreading
after the two boys had showered and changed their clothes mrs swift served them a delicious hot meal
for minutes no one stirred among the wreckage
two hours later there was nothing more tom and bud could do at the disaster scene and they hitched a ride into harkness
he broke off with a gasp of astonishment as the whole building suddenly began to shake
tom laughed
im so thankful youre both safe she murmured
both boys were amazed and excited
the two boys followed mr faber and his engineers to a wooden building which was tightly guarded
the boys found a first aid cabinet and gave what help they could to them and the other two men
no use fussing about it now tom said
what hit me
we grow em tough out in california where i come from he joked
dont worry sis
right bud responded
hope you can find out whats wrong
power lines were down and an outlying storage shed was ablaze
only two thirds of the walls were still standing
another engineer rushed toward the door to see what was happening outside
we heard a bulletin about the quake over the radio
hes a great scientist
this isnt part of your testing routine is it
of the four other company engineers two were now stirring and partly conscious
the eighteen year old inventor accepted the challenge with a smile ill be glad to try sir he replied
he also called home and spoke to his sister sandra
come on bud
the two girls were as much upset as toms mother
the telephone line was soon repaired and a steady stream of rescue vehicles began arriving from harknessfire trucks three ambulances and private cars driven by volunteers
mr faber he gasped
he had heard about the great san francisco earthquake from his grandfather and had no doubt about the nature of the tremors
good grief bud exclaimed
phyl a pretty dark haired girl was the daughter of mr swifts longtime friend and business associate uncle ned newton
wow bud gasped
the center of the quake was right under faber electronics tom remarked
good night toms eyes focused in horror on the wreckage enveloped by still billowing dust
from another planet mr swift revealed
none of those he replied as the boys stared mystified
while they ate mr swift managed after some difficulty to get a call through to the harkness hospital his face was grave as he hung up
a falling beam caught him on the back of the head and the young flier blacked out
lets see if we can find a telephone and call the local hospital tom said
they picked their way through the wreckage and emerged on a scene of frightful destruction
tom asked the operator to send a helicopter immediately to pick them up
why not send a car
mark faber is not expected to live the elder inventor reported
you got conked by a falling timber
got a job for us
the boys exchanged rueful glances as they realized that the craft which had brought them to faber electronicsone of toms unique helijetshad been swallowed up in the gaping chasm
were not stretcher cases he said
tom were having a problem with the gyro stabilizer said mark faber gray haired president of the faber electronics company
then tom taped a bandage on buds scalp wound
the test stands breaking loose tom warned
before he reached it another shock knocked all of them off their feet
the roof its caving in he heard someone scream
i tried to assure them that you and bud can take care of yourselves in any crisis he smiled guiltily as he added but i must admit i was more than a little concerned myself
disregarding his own injuries tom hastily freed himself from the debris and groped his way to buds side
if anyone can get the bugs out of your new invention genius boy here will do it
look out
the town had suffered some damage though only slight compared to the destruction at the plant
the main plant building of faber electronics had been partially demolished by the quake
are you all right tom asked fearfully
if that beam had landed square on your noggin even a rock head like you couldnt have survived
despite the chaotic confusion the boys managed to locate the plant superintendenta harried middle aged man named simkinswho was doing his best to restore order
inside a secret rocket telemetering device was mounted on its test stand
its only a few miles away isnt it
tell mother and dad that were okay tom said well be home in a jiffywith big appetites
good thing the main shift of workers knocked off before this happened bud observed with a shudder
mrs swift a slender petite woman tried not to show concern when she saw the boys bruised and disheveled
an earthquake tom gasped
somewhat shakily bud got to his feet with toms assistance
the two boys scrambled through the clutter of debris toward the spot where the test stand had been erected
wed better not try to move him tom decided
there wouldve been a lot more casualties
at the end of it she was in a place of tombs
it is nothing
even if he were alive her heart was past being moved
chapter twelve
she knew nothing of the place had nowhere to go nowhere she wanted to go had not a thought to tell her what question to ask if she met a living soul
he is dead
it was all deadness
she is nothing to me
that night and every night until the dust was laid to the dust mary slept well and through the days she had great composure but when the funeral was over came a collapse and a change
the universe was sunk in one of the dreams that haunt the sleep of death and if these were ghosts at all they were ghosts walking in their sleep
if i speak to her she is not there
how could she she had not seen christ rise she had never looked upon one of the dead never heard a voice from the other bank had received no certain testimony
terror and a dismay indescribable seized her she turned and fled back to the company of her kind
oh cold creatures ye are not what ye seem and i will none of you
of a sudden a great splendor burst upon her and through her eyelids she was struck blindblind with light and not with darkness for all was radiance about her
but not a throb went through her heart
i am nothing
she was one of a large company at a house where she had never been beforea beautiful house with a large garden behind
then came the form of her mother and bent over that of her brother from behind
he came to her side and she gave him no greeting
all day the wind had been out
through the moonlight they led her from the city and over fields and through valleys and across rivers and seasa long journey nor did she grow weary for there was not life enough in her to be made weary
she was out of place and much unwelcome
she found herself at length in an avenue of dark trees the end of which was far off
that night was the first herald of the coming winter and blew a cold blast from his horn
her only life was that she was lost
but for a long time she sought the house in vain she could not reach it the avenue seemed interminable to her feet returning
no carriage rolled along the center no footfarer walked on the side
everything is an empty dream of loss
and the voice said poor child something has closed the valve between her heart and mine with that came a pang of intense pain
the loss the evanishment the ceasing were incontrovertiblethe only incontrovertible things she was sure of them could she be sure of anything else
her whole consciousness was merest all but abstract loss
but she neither loved the light nor mourned the shadow
every now and then she came on a little group or met a party of the guests as she walked but none spoke to her or seemed to see her and she spoke to none
at last she fell asleep and in a moment was dreaming diligently
i know it and there is no waking
but the dead one of them seized one of her hands and another the other
if for a moment a thing looked the same as before she wondered vaguely unconsciously how it could be
the smell of the linen of the blue cloth and of the brown paperthings no longer to be handled by those tender faithful handswas dismal and strange and haunted her like things that intruded things which she had done with and which yet would not go away
death was a fact
the dead never spoke to her and she never spoke to them
thus was she borne away captive of her dead neither willing nor unwilling of life and death equally careless
she was like a fish in a sea of light
the old time was but a thicker dream and this is truer because more shadowy and the form still standing by her she felt it was ages away she was divided from it by a gulf of very nothingness
this is a librivox recording
shall we walk along the embankment or go somewhere on the underground
i havent answered her letter
well it was not too late
this preamble sent a shiver of dread down her spine
she would have shared his sorrow and shown herself half wife half angel from heaven in this dark hour
well she said
it was on the tip of her tongue to say that she would stand by him whatever he had done but if he had married someone else this would be improper so she only said well and she said it coldly
her tears were falling hot and fast between face and veil for she had talked till she was very sorry indeed for herself
no its all overyouve broken my heart and destroyed my faith in human nature i hope i shall never see you again
they did not speak again till they had gone through the little back streets past the police station and the mustard factory and were on the broad pavement of queen victoria street
lets go out he said
following the tingle of relief came a sharp sickening pinch of jealousy and mortification
what opinion would he form of the purity of her mind the innocence of her soul if an incident like this failed to shock her deeply
how warm it would have been in the orchard
never she said her eyes flashing through her tears
the setting of the scene seemed to her all important
her dress was brown her jacket black and her hat was home trimmed
she herself should have been a poema lyric in a white gown and green scarf coming to him through the long grass under the blossomed boughs
but how
so she said
some great sorrow had come to him
when she did her words did not fit the mouth of the girl in the orchardbut then it would have been may there and this was january
yes
and its good bye for ever noits only painful for both of us
look here darling ive got something to tell you and i hope to god youll forgive me and stand by me and try to understand that i love you just the same and whatever happens i shall always love you
as the confession of a crime she must receive it
he loved her with all his heart and he also had what she had never suspected in himthe literary sense
he had never been like this before
this really was a master stroke of nobility
yes isnt it he said
she could begin now
she had grown anxious as the one who waits always does and she was extremely glad to see him but she knew that a late lover should be treated with a provoking coldness one can relent prettily later on so she gave him a limp hand and no greeting
for more information or to volunteer please visit librivox dot org
and she had been sulking
she could have snapped off a blossoming branch andand made play with it somehow
im freezing she said suddenly lets go and have some tea
but herethe only thing that occurred to her was to stop and look in one of the shops till he should ask her what she was looking at
the fine tact of a noble woman seemed to have deserted her
he had asked her to meet him at cannon street he had something to say to her and at home it was difficult to get a quiet half hour because of her little sisters
do you think im not sorry now
those four true words wounded her more than all the rest
oh the embankment please and felt a sting of annoyance and disappointment when he acquiesced
she drew a deep breath
at home she could at least have buried her face in the sofa cushions and resisted all his pleadingat last perhaps letting him take one cold passive hand and shower frantic kisses upon it
yet perhaps after all that is not because of the literary sense it may be because she loved him
and the fact that she was to meet him at cannon street station would almost she feared make the meeting itself banal sordid
what was it compared with her fears
she almost said never mind dear
he checked the silly impulse
yet she must speak
how should she know that he had only told her because he feared that she would anyhow hear it through the indiscretion of the girl in pink or of that other girl in blue who had seen and smiled
he had been late he had offered no excuse no explanation
she had to the full limit allowed of her reading and her environment the literary sense
she only wished for may and the orchard instead of january and the dingy dusty waiting room the plain faced preoccupied travellers the dim desolate weather
theres no more to be said youve betrayed me
how could she guess that he had tuned his confession to the key of what he believed would be an innocent girls estimate of his misconduct
i cant bear to see you looking so miserable and there was another silence
these inspired her
the girl in the orchard would have known at a glance
she had done the proper thing she had awaited these with dignified reserve and now she was involved in the meshes of a silence that she could not break how easy it would have been in the orchard
because destiny is almost without the literary sense and destiny carelessly decreed that he should die of enteric in a wretched hut without so much as hearing a gun fired
noits no usei can never never forgive youand its all over
he ought to insist on the railway carriage he probably would
how frightfully cold it is
youve deceived me onceyoud do it again
but how could he go back to say we are parting for ever but still i must insist on the sad pleasure of paying for our teafor the last time
seated at a marble tablethe place was nearly emptyshe furtively watched his face in the glass and what she saw there thrilled her
she stole a glance at him and for the first time it occurred to her that his something to say was not a mere excuse for being alone with her he had something to saysomething that was trying to get itself said the keen wind thrust itself even inside the high collar of her jacket her hands and feet were aching with cold
he came towards her he was five minutes late
it was a very good exit
then he would have had to say something
he stood up suddenly
all librivox recordings are in the public domain
the time should have been may
as soon as the two were alone again he leaned his elbows on the marble and spoke
she would have liked to meet him in some green cool orchard where daffodils swung in the long grass and primroses stood on frail stiff little pink stalks in the wet scented moss of the hedgerow
im only talking as i know good girls ought to talk
go home and gloat over it all
i didnt think a decent man could do such things she was pulling on her gloves
forgive me dear he said
he had told her of the thing as one tells of a crime
he himself was evidently a prey to the most rending remorse
you know i do he said it was hateful of mebut i couldnt help it
he would hardly have known her in green and white muslin and an orchard for their love had been born and bred in townhighbury new park to be exact
at the corner he remembered that he had gone away without paying for the tea and his natural impulse was to go back and remedy that error
and how common and mean that would be compared with the blossoming bough and besides the shops they were passing had nothing in the windows except cheap pastry and models of steam engines
she was going to meet her lover
he could not say and so i am on the whole which was what he thought
of course if you like he said uncomfortably yet she could see he was glad that she had broken that desolate silence
then how can i ever trust you
you dont love meyouve never loved mei was an idiot to believe you did
you see that she knew exactly how a tryst is conducted in the pages of the standard poets and of the cheaper weekly journals
couldnt help it
good bye
then she rose to the occasion
it was bitterly cold but the embankment was more romantic than a railway carriage
by e nesbit
he would come to morrow however and then at present the thing to compass was a dignified parting
and curiously enough she was hardly curious at all about what he might have to say
her hands should have been full of bluebells and she should have held them up to his face in maidenly defence as he sprang forward to take her in his arms
why on earth didnt he speak
he stood up suddenly
the waitress brought the two thick cups of tea and looked at him with a tepid curiosity
are you really going to throw me over for a thing like this
good bye she said im going home
the anger in his eyes frightened her and the misery of his face wrung her heart but how could she say
even if we were married i could never be sure you werent kissing some horrid girl or other
what had he donea murdera bank robberymarried someone else
then good bye he said and may god forgive you as i do and he strode down between the marble tables and out by the swing door
so she waited for him in vain and at last paid for the tea herself and went home to wait thereand there too in vain for he never came back to her
do you mean it he said and his tone should have warned her
oh ethel do try to forgive me
so she said
it serves me right she said in excellent yet unfamiliar english
go on he said tell me all about it
i feel as if i had been beaten
do drink this and then tell me
i was thinking of french
it was plain that his castanet girlhis mother and sister took a pleasure in crediting her daily with some fresh and unpleasing instrumentcould have had neither taste money nor honesty to such a point as this
i am sure you meant to be kind and then she began to cry again
american heiresses are expected to marry english dukes he said with a distinct physical pain at his heart
she rose
again that strange hesitationthen quite suddenly the girl put her hands up to her face and began to cry
the performer was evidently singing under her voice but the effect was charming
i shall lock up all the doors and windows in the houseand then i shall give you my latch key and you can let yourself in and stay the night herethere is no one in the house
she turned quickly and came back two steps
all the same he added irrelevantly you shall have the latch key
look here he said this is all nonsense you know
you see papas so very rich and at home they expect me toto get acquainted with dukes and thingsand
wont you sing again he asked
then there was silencethen a sigh and the sound of light moving feet on the gravel
she looked at him and spoke for the first time
she laughed
there had been five organs since dinnerand seven in the afternoonone and all urgently thumping their heavy melodies into his brain to the confusion of the thoughts that waited there eager to marshal themselves orderly and firm into the phalanx of an article on the decadence of criticism
im poor too
so its your destiny to marry a duke is it the young man spoke slowly
arent you tired he said
she spent the rest of that day in searching the house for further losses but all things were in their place except the silver handled button hookand that as even his sister owned had been missing for months
well then i went into lodgings that wicked woman had left me one street suitand to day they turned me out because my money was all gone
wouldnt you like to sit down and rest there is a seat in the garden at the side of the house
he went into the dining room dark with mahogany and damask found wine and cake in the sideboard cupboard put them on a tray and took them out through the garden door and round to the corner where almost sheltered by laburnums and hawthorns from the view of the people next door the singer and her guitar rested on the iron seat
he stood with his hand on the curtain listeningand with a pleasure that astonished him
never had any act seemed so impossible
she held out a pair of little patent leather shoes very worn and dustythe slender silken web of a black stocking brown with dust hung from her hand
i have brought you some winewill you have it
the hotel folks let her goi cant think how people can be so silly
let me gothank you very much
he filled his pipe drew paper towards him dipped his pen and wrote his title on the blank page
it would have turned out all right with them
he reflected a moment
her little foot tapped the gravel impatiently
i might have known i couldnt do it though its just what girls in books would do
i dont understand a single word you say
you dont know how horrid everyone has been
the only excuse for this rash young man is to be found in the fact that while he was feeding his strange guest with cake and wine she was feeding with her beauty the first fire of his first love
then it was taken away
after all it was a quiet neighbourhood as the advertisement had saidat any rate in the evening and in the evening a mans best efforts
youve quarrelled with your friends andah tell meand let me try to help you
he hurriedly cut cake and pressed it upon her
and so forth
and ive been at it since five oclockand ive only got one shilling and seven pence
and he sat there thinking till his mothers voice roused him
here he called to the figure that moved slowly towards the gate
oh lord
the young man drew a deep breath of relief and lighted the wax candles in the solid silver candlesticks on his writing table for now the late summer dusk was falling and that organ please heaven made full the measure of the days appointed torture
an adventuress
he threw back the curtain and leaned out of the window
perhaps i can help you
let me think he said
here signorina ecco prendivinogattono gattos a cat
then we will see what can be done
the last strains of the ill treated ill fated intermezzo had died away and after them had died away also the rumbling of the wheels of the murderous barrel organ that had so gaily executed that along with the nine other tunes of its repertory to the admiration of the housemaid at the window of the house opposite and the crowing delight of the two babies next door
i told you so said his mother at onceand the young man sat down at his study table and looked at the title of his article on the decadence of criticism it was surely a very long time ago that he had written that
he sprang to his feetthis was indeed too much
what is it
she drank obediently
she hesitated then struck a chord or two and began another of those little tuneful italian songs all stars and flowers and hearts of gold and again he listened with a quiet pleasure
of course he didnt
then she turned towards the quarter indicated and disappeared round the laurel bushes
herei say you knowdont he said
i will catch the night train and bring my mother up to morrow
he did not kiss it then only took it in his and felt how small and cold it was
he answered nothing
it wasnt i who said that said the girl smiling but thats so anyhow and then she sighed
he had no time to think but he was aware that this was the most exciting adventure that had ever happened to him
the half dozen pairs of embroidered silk stockings and the dainty french silver buckled shoes which arrived a month later addressed to miss hill view villa only confirmed their distrust
she wore the dress of a contadina a very smart dress indeed and her hands looked small and white
again she hesitated
but dont you know anyone in london he asked in a sensible postscript
why thats nothing
love at first sight is all nonsense we knowwe who have come to forty yearbut at twenty one one does not somehow recognise it for the nonsense it is
she stopped short and looked at him through the dusk
im coming to that she said
her eyes filled again with tears
i have only told you enough to teach you how to look for yourselves a peep you know is all i promised you
the thought came to them that it might be prepared from coal and conducted through pipes to our houses to take the place of lamps or candles which until that time had been the only light
at first you know they will only play
it is this earth on which we live
dont you see how many uses we have found for this refuse coal tar
a peep into one of gods storehouses
of course they would explore and explore try every panel and press every spring until one by one all the closets should be opened and all the treasures brought out
besides the dyes we shall also have left naphtha useful in making varnish and various oils that are used in more ways than i can stop to tell you or you would care now to hear
this served for a hint to curious men to make them ask what is this and what is it good for and so at last following their questions to find their way to the secret stores and make an open doorway and let the world in
these forests were of trees different in some ways from those we have now great ferns as tall as this house and mosses as high as little trees and palm leaves of enormous size
look a little closer while our guide lets the light of his lamp fall upon the black wall at your side
let us look at them for perhaps we can examine them more closely than we can the roof and the sides of these halls
if she does you are indebted again to the coal oil for of that it is partly made
the doorway of this storehouse lies in the side of a hill
the least they could do would be to try to use every thing for the purposes intended and not to destroy or injure any of the precious gifts prepared so lovingly for their use
the floors were carpeted with velvet and the whole was lighted with lamps that shone like stars from above
how did it happen and what does it mean
see beneath your feet is the marking of great tree trunks lying aslant across the floor and the forms of gigantic palm leaves strewed among them
so this great green hill upon which you might run or play is inside like what i think some of those large anthills must betraversed by galleries and full of rooms and long passages
here is something different rounded like a nut shell you can split off one side and behold there is the nut lying snugly as does any chestnut in its bur
do you see the delicate tracery of ferns more beautiful than the fairest drawing
but here is another surprise of a different kind
what do you think of that from the coal tar
when your hands or lips are cracked and rough from the cold does your mother ever put on glycerin to heal them
but do you imagine that sensible children after one such discovery would rest satisfied
we shall need a guide and here comes onea rough looking man with smutty clothes and an odd little lamp covered with wire gauze fastened to the front of his cap
did you notice the great pillars of coal that are left to uphold the roof
and then how could they show their gratitude to the dear father who had taken such pains to prepare this wonderful house for them
why did he give that so odd a shape or so strange a covering
and so through many questions and many experiments they learn at last how to use the contents of this one storehouse
and so it began to be used to cover roofs of buildings and mixed with some other substances made a pavement for streets and being spread over iron work it protected it from rust
but you will find that they are really pulled and pushed by an engine that stands outside the doorway and reaches them by long chains
now i can very well remember when i first saw a coal fire and how odd it looked to see what seemed to be burning stones
if you have not perhaps you would like to go with me to examine one that was opened a good many years ago but contains such valuable things that the uses of all of them have not yet been found out and their beauty is just beginning to be known
all about we see men like our guide working by the light of their little lamps
ferns and palms mosses and trees and animals all perfect all beautiful and yet all hidden away under this hill and turned into shining black coal
the sweetest perfumes floated through the air while thousands of birds answered the music of fountains with their songs
what should we have done if everybody had kept on burning wood to this day
the entrance is light because it opens so wide but we can see that the floor slopes downward and the way looks dark and narrow before us
once there was a father who thought he would build for his children a beautiful home putting into it every thing they could need or desire throughout their lives
as it floated on the surface of the water for oil and water will not mix you know the boys for mischief set fire to it and a stream of fire rolled along down the river proving to everybody who saw it that a new light as good as gas had come from the coal
here are mosses and little leaves and sometimes an odd looking little body that is not unlike some of the sea creatures we found at the beach last summer and every thing is made of coal nothing but coal
is it robert whispered glenarvan
all escape was thus hopeless and glenarvan having tried the walls for the twentieth time was compelled to acknowledge that it was so
chapter twelve strangely liberated
wilson and olbinett joined their companions and all united to dig through the walljohn with his dagger the others with stones taken from the ground or with their nails while mulrady stretched along the ground watched the native guard through a crevice of the matting
i did not speak for ourselves said glenarvan
it was evidently the cue of both sides to be silent
but softly as the name was breathed mary grant already awakened by the sounds in the hut slipped over toward glenarvan and seizing the hand all stained with earth she covered it with kisses
robert disappeared through the opening out of the grotto
i am not an advocate of irremediable measures
had they been seen
neither moon nor stars pierced the gloom
john mangles before leaving the hut disposed of all the evidences of their work and in his turn slipped through the opening and let down over it the mats of the house so that the entrance to the gallery was quite concealed
the hours of this night wretched as they were slipped away
glenarvan holding with one hand to a tuft of tetragonia with the other holding his wife waited with breathless anxiety
some minutes more passed and the major withdrew his hand from the stroke of a sharp blade
this rope said he will only bear the weight of two persons therefore let us go in rotation
animal or man answered the major i will soon find out
suddenly a terrific yell from a hundred throats rent the air
he was now the object of their anxiety and whose absence was a black shadow between them and their happiness
but they all kept watchful guard on the hut confided to their care
glenarvans voice firm till now faltered
watch the savages outside said robert
there are only four awake the rest are asleep
while they looked they were seen
lady helena repeated the evening prayer aloud her companions bare headed repeated it after her
i discovered a deep hollow at the foot of the slope where those who come down can conceal themselves and wait for the rest
i will go first said robert
if it is decreed that we die to morrow let us die bravely like christian men ready to appear without terror before the supreme judge
thick darkness had settled on the mountain
my darling robert said she never doubting it is you it is you
soon they had reached a height of five hundred feet above lake taupo and the cold of the morning increased by the altitude was very keen
this done the prisoners embraced each other
god who reads our hearts knows that we had a noble end in view
listen said he motioning them to stoop
the prisoners redoubled their efforts
the escape was commenced and every precaution was taken
be it as it may we can face death
yes john but we are unarmed
the soil was light and friable and below lay a bed of silicious tufa therefore even without tools the aperture deepened quickly
i stole this knife and rope out of the desert hut
let us attack these wretches but with these poor girls
the meal ended
we must show these savages how europeans can die
after these words were said a profound silence ensued
wherever paganel is he cannot be in worse plight than ourselves
who does not turn his thoughts toward god in the hour of death
they had one night in which to prepare for death
another half an hour and the glorious sun would rise out of the mists of the horizon
the jailer may forget that he is on guard the prisoner never forgets that he is guarded
i believe said john that in the sight of god i have a right to fulfill that promise
but the fugitives could not doubt that their escape had been discovered and now the question was would they be able to elude pursuit
at last the sun appeared and sent his first rays on their path
then glenarvan taking his friends aside said my dear friends our lives and the lives of these poor women are in gods hands
no my lord said robert taken aback by the disappearance of his friend paganel
the captive thinks oftener of escaping than the jailer of preventing his flight and hence we hear of frequent and wonderful escapes
the misty summits began to pierce the morning mists
my lord whichever of us survives the other will fulfill the wish of lady helena and mary grant
the scratching became more and more audible they could hear the little stones grate on a hard body and roll away
is paganel below asked glenarvan
then glenarvan going first and supporting his wife began to descend backward
then shaking his head like one who sees he is mistaken he went back to his companions took an armful of dead wood and threw it into the smouldering fire which immediately revived
john signaled to glenarvan to resume his descent
brave lad repeated glenarvan
round his body was rolled a long coil of flax rope
sleep which keeps all sorrow in abeyance soon weighed down their eyelids they slept in each others arms overcome by exhaustion and prolonged watching
glenarvan first then lady helena let themselves down along the rope till they came to the spot where the perpendicular wall met the top of the slope
the next thing was to descend the vertical wall to the slope below and this would have been impracticable but that robert had brought the flax rope which was now unrolled and fixed to a projecting point of rock the end hanging over
they had to fly
dim outlines of hills and mountains rose behind one another but glenarvan only thought how best to get lost among them time enough by and by to see about escaping from the labyrinth
my child my child murmured lady helena the savages did not kill you
paganel was not there to take the lead
john mangles inserting the blade of his poniard avoided the knife which now protruded above the soil but seized the hand that wielded it
well lose no more time said the major
where chance led them but at any rate they were free
lord and lady glenarvan first when they arrive at the bottom three pulls at the rope will be a signal to us to follow
they had reached halfway down the slope when a voice was heard from the opening of the grotto
overcome as they were with horror and fatigue they took their last meal together
at this moment john raised the mat and counted twenty five natives keeping guard on the ware atoua
yes little sister said he it is i am here to save you all but be very silent
glenarvan struck his forehead
glenarvan and lady helena immediately ventured out of the grotto
no robert answered mary grant
it soon became evident that a man or men clinging to the sides of the pah were cutting a passage into its exterior wall
stern as the decree may seem i will not repine
let us go
toward five oclock the day began to dawn bluish clouds marbled the upper stratum of clouds
did you not get away together
john you have promised mary what i promised lady helena
no my lord but is he not here inquired robert
the rope was shaken three times and in his turn john mangles preceding mary grant followed in the dangerous route
one of the warriors on guard startled by an unusual sound rose and drew nearer to the ware atoua
besides a thick veil of fog which spread at his feet prevented any distinct view of the valleys below
they walked quickly trying to avoid the points where they might be seen from the pah
he was silent a moment and having overcome his emotion he said addressing the young captain
but death here means not death only it means torture insult perhaps and here are two ladies
go my boy said glenarvan pressing roberts hand
she felt stronger and commenced her perilous descent
john mangles before his friends trusted themselves to this flax rope tried it he did not think it very strong and it was of importance not to risk themselves imprudently as a fall would be fatal
some birds suddenly awakened flew away uttering feeble cries and the fugitives trembled when a stone loosened from its bed rolled to the foot of the mountain
it was the hand of a woman or child a european
it came from the pah whose direction glenarvan did not know
let us be off said he in a decided tone
we ought to have seen the lights of auckland thirty six hours ago
their minds were so distracted at this change of route as to be quite unhinged
our lives would be worth little
however for that day at least the yacht did not appear and the sixth night from their departure from twofold bay came without the fears of john mangles being realized
we would fight to the death of course but after that
their friends did their best to amuse them
besides they were going to this new and ill reputed country without enthusiasm without conviction not even of their own free will but solely at the bidding of destiny
think of lady glenarvan think of mary grant
and yet said the young captain you must be longing to quit this vessel
john my heart is broken and sometimes despair nearly masters me
why john
look more to starboard
glenarvan shook his head in dissent
what then my lord
but as to getting alongside the duncan
much as they had been interested in his dissertation on the pampas or australia his lectures on new zealand fell on cold and indifferent ears
still this wearisome voyage dragged on
you my lord
john came up to him and said your lordship is looking out for land
it must be here on these coasts skimming these very waves playing the vile part of a pirate it is here john i am certain of it on the track of vessels between australia and new zealand and i have a presentiment that we shall fall in with her
my yacht the duncan said glenarvan hotly
he could not stay in one place
god keep us from such a meeting
god forbid
then they returned to the narrow space fitter for stowing cargo than accommodating passengers especially ladies
will halley is a brute but i am keeping my eyes open and if the coast looks dangerous i will put the ships head to sea again so that on that score there is little or no danger
we should be taken delivered up to the mercy of those wretches and ben joyce has shown us that he does not stop at a crime
i am not looking for the land
they often braved the weather and went on the poop till driven down again by the force of a sudden squall
poor girls murmured glenarvan
keep up your heart my lord said the young captain
fly john
yes my lord we should try in vain
he still looked and for a moment his glass was pointed toward the horizon to windward
we must not look out for troubles
there was every reason to fear such an engagement in these narrow seas in which pirates could ply their trade without risk
your lordship forgets our position
why john replied glenarvan
and if your lordship is bent on looking out for her let it be in order to give her a wide berth
the wind was fair nevertheless and blew steadily from the southwest but the currents were against the ships course and she scarcely made any way
not for myself john but for those i lovewhom you love also
the heavy lumpy sea strained her cordage her timbers creaked and she labored painfully in the trough of the sea
what is it coralie she asked the woman
if i lived as luxuriously as my people do and had servants and costly gowns the good pinkies would say that their queen had more than they themselvesand it would be true
we do not hate you as you say the blueskins do nor are we savage or cruel but we do not want you here and i am really puzzled what to do with you
meantime you will go home with coralie who will feed you and give you entertainment
tourmaline the poverty queen
did you suppose a palace would be like one of our handsome residences asked the woman evidently surprised
come commanded the woman who led the party you three must follow me to the presence of tourmaline
why asked tourmaline curiously
the queen gazed upon our friends with evident interest
pretty wet
majesty she exclaimed flushing a deeper pink
she says it makes her head ache to perform witchcraft and so she seldom indulges in it
they tell a queer story of an escape from the blueskins so i decided to bring them to you that you may determine their fate
no banners floated from it no flowers grew near it
how about witches asked button bright
i even decree death when such a punishment is merited
i did not choose to be the queen answered tourmaline simply
in that case said button bright youre entitled to the best there is to pay for your trouble
in that case my subjects would justly grow envious of my superior station
it is much more desirable to be a private citizen happy and care free
but if there is no other way i may be obliged to call upon rosalie for help
pretty wet was the journey you can bet
just tourmaline
declared the parrot in conclusion
a splendid palace exclaimed one of the pinkies and then they looked at one another in amazement and seemed to doubt that their ears had heard aright
i know of one witch said tourmaline thoughtfully but she is not very obliging
that is my reward
here said one of their guides as the procession halted before the little stone building is the palace of tourmaline who is our queen
oh there are fairies of course as there are everywhere answered tourmaline but none that we can call to our assistance or command to do our bidding
as they entered the girl sighed and laid down her work
what pays you then for all your bother asked trot
the people must wait outside for there is no room for them in the palace
your sky island aint very big so when we couldnt stay in the blue country where everbody hated us or in the fog bank which aint healthy an is too wet for humans to live in for long we natrally were forced to enter the pink country where we expected to find nice people
thank you said trot
oh no responded tourmaline quickly that would indeed be very wrong
so they followed her through the low archway and in a room beyond very simply furnished sat a young girl engaged in darning a pair of pink stockings
button bright told this and then trot related their adventures among the blueskins and how the boolooroo had stolen the umbrella and prevented them from going home again
the open space which they entered was paved with pink marble and around it were two rows of large pink statues at least lifesize and beautifully sculptured
there is nothing majestic about me as you know very well
her expression was patient and resigned as she faced her audience
ill look in the great book first
we wish so too
no your majesty he replied im only
the ruler be it king or queen has absolute power to rule but no richesno high stationno false adulation
isnt there a law to cover this case asked coralie
i know answered tourmaline but i hope such a responsibility will not fall upon my shoulders
but what can you do here asked tourmaline
by no means was the prompt reply
capn bill finished the story by telling of their escape through the fog bank
the ruler of a country ought to be treated with great respec declared trot a little indignantly for she thought the pretty little queen was not being properly deferred to
your folks ought to treat you with great respect as trot says
if not said the woman you must make a law
it was her badge of office and seemed very incongruous when compared with her poor raiment and simple surroundings
if with my great power conferred upon me by the people i also possessed great wealth i might be tempted to be cruel and overbearing
she was a beautiful girl of about seventeen years of age not fat like all the rest of the pinkies but slender and well formed according to our own ideas of beauty
what shall i call her then inquired capn bill
between them they told the story of how the magic umbrella had taken them to sky island which they did not know when they started was anywhere in existence
i thought it would be better said the girl
what that little cabin exclaimed trot
to morrow morning come to me again and then i will decree your fate
it had no ornamentation being exceedingly plain in appearance
all the palaces ive seen were splendid
that is her name and it is sufficient said the woman
it is your duty
in all our history you are the first people from outside our borders who have ever stepped a foot in our land
a powerful ruler ought to be rich and to live in a splendid palace
perhaps you are trying to ridicule me she continued regarding the sailors face closely
they seem very ignorant poor things said another in reply
of course
i have one great privilege
a misfortune of birth placed me here and i cannot escape my fate
coralie do you consider majesty a proper word to use when addressing a queen she added appealing to the pinky woman
she smileda little sadlyat trot seemed to approve button brights open frank face and was quite surprised because capn bill was so much bigger than her own people
these intruders are very peculiar people remarked a man in the crowd
no our way is best
you are not like my people the pinkies and there is no place for you in our country
the whole scene was depressing for it argued at the first glance at least a stagnation of industry and perhaps of intellect
it was one of those effects which a painter loves to represent and mingled well with the struggling light which found its way between the boughs of the shady arch that vaulted the broad green alley
the evil and remedy such as it is still existbut this is remote from our present purpose and is only thrown out for consideration of the collectors under mr dents dog bill
footnote see note seven
the windows were numberless but very small the roof had some nondescript kind of projections called bartizans and displayed at each frequent angle a small turret rather resembling a pepper box than a gothic watchtower
in a few favoured instances there appeared behind the cottages a miserable wigwam compiled of earth loose stones and turf where the wealthy might perhaps shelter a starved cow or sorely galled horse
stables and other offices occupied another side of the square
they stood without any respect for regularity on each side of a straggling kind of unpaved street where children almost in a primitive state of nakedness lay sprawling as if to be crushed by the hoofs of the first passing horse
three or four village girls returning from the well or brook with pitchers and pails upon their heads formed more pleasing objects and with their thin short gowns and single petticoats bare arms legs and feet uncovered heads and braided hair somewhat resembled italian forms of landscape
the children also whose skins were burnt black and whose hair was bleached white by the influence of the sun had a look and manner of life and interest it seemed upon the whole as if poverty and indolence its too frequent companion were combining to depress the natural genius and acquired information of a hardy intelligent and reflecting peasantry
it had been built at a period when castles were no longer necessary and when the scottish architects had not yet acquired the art of designing a domestic residence
the house which seemed to consist of two or three high narrow and steep roofed buildings projecting from each other at right angles formed one side of the inclosure
this dove cot or columbarium as the owner called it was no small resource to a scottish laird of that period whose scanty rents were eked out by the contributions levied upon the farms by these light foragers and the conscriptions exacted from the latter for the benefit of the table
this work of art was the wonder of the country ten miles round
in the centre of the exterior barrier was the upper gate of the avenue opening under an archway battlemented on the top and adorned with two large weather beaten mutilated masses of upright stone which if the tradition of the hamlet could be trusted had once represented at least had been once designed to represent two rampant bears the supporters of the family of bradwardine
nor was the court without its ornaments
everything around appeared solitary and would have been silent but for the continued plashing of the fountain and the whole scene still maintained the monastic illusion which the fancy of waverley had conjured up
neither did the front indicate absolute security from danger
the court was spacious well paved and perfectly clean there being probably another entrance behind the stables for removing the litter
this nether portal like the former opened in front of a wall ornamented with some rude sculpture with battlements on the top over which were seen half hidden by the trees of the avenue the high steep roofs and narrow gables of the mansion with lines indented into steps and corners decorated with small turrets
the opening into the paved court yard corresponded with the rest of the scene
but almost every hut was fenced in front by a huge black stack of turf on one side of the door while on the other the family dunghill ascended in noble emulation
two battlemented walls one of which faced the avenue and the other divided the court from the garden completed the inclosure
this person whom they call gifted gilfillan has been long a leader among them and now heads a small party which will pass here to day or to morrow on their march towards stirling under whose escort major melville proposes you shall travel
they take their name from their leader richard cameron
the habit of inattention must be considered as the greatest bane of the democratic character
but it must not be supposed that in the midst of all their toils the people who live in democracies think themselves to be pitied the contrary is remarked to be the case
when an aristocracy carries on the public affairs its national pride naturally assumes this reserved indifferent and haughty form which is imitated by all the other classes of the nation
as at any instant these same advantages may be lost their possessors are constantly on the alert and make a point of showing that they still retain them
as these privileges came to them by inheritance they regard them in some sort as a portion of themselves or at least as a natural right inherent in their own persons
life would have no relish for them if they were delivered from the anxieties which harass them and they show more attachment to their cares than aristocratic nations to their pleasures
there is one sort of ignorance which originates in extreme publicity
it is remarkable that two nations so recently sprung from the same stock should be so opposite to one another in their manner of feeling and conversing
an american instead of going in a leisure hour to dance merrily at some place of public resort as the fellows of his calling continue to do throughout the greater part of europe shuts himself up at home to drink
men living in democracies love their country just as they love themselves and they transfer the habits of their private vanity to their vanity as a nation
these persons then displayed towards each other precisely the same puerile jealousies which animate the men of democracies the same eagerness to snatch the smallest advantages which their equals contested and the same desire to parade ostentatiously those of which they were in possession
all free nations are vainglorious but national pride is not displayed by all in the same manner
this is more especially the case amongst those free nations which form democratic communities
when on the contrary social conditions differ but little the slightest privileges are of some importance as every man sees around himself a million of people enjoying precisely similar or analogous advantages his pride becomes craving and jealous he clings to mere trifles and doggedly defends them
they want something productive and substantial in their pleasures they want to mix actual fruition with their joy
the most slender eulogium is acceptable to them the most exalted seldom contents them they unceasingly harass you to extort praise and if you resist their entreaties they fall to praising themselves
it would seem as if doubting their own merit they wished to have it constantly exhibited before their eyes
they stand unmoved in their solitary greatness well assured that they are seen of all the world without any effort to show themselves off and that no one will attempt to drive them from that position
it is astonishing what imprudent language a public man may sometimes use in free countries and especially in democratic states without being compromised whereas in absolute monarchies a few words dropped by accident are enough to unmask him forever and ruin him without hope of redemption
an englishman calmly enjoys the real or imaginary advantages which in his opinion his country possesses if he grants nothing to other nations neither does he solicit anything for his own
in despotic states men know not how to act because they are told nothing in democratic nations they often act at random because nothing is to be left untold
they prefer to these frivolous delights those more serious and silent amusements which are like business and which do not drive business wholly from their minds
in democracies men are never stationary a thousand chances waft them to and fro and their life is always the sport of unforeseen or so to speak extemporaneous circumstances
i thought that the english constituted the most serious nation on the face of the earth but i have since seen the americans and have changed my opinion
this is explained by what goes before
chapter fifteen of the gravity of the americans and why it does not prevent them from often committing inconsiderate actions
then there are in all classes a very large number of men constantly occupied with the serious affairs of the government and those whose thoughts are not engaged in the direction of the commonwealth are wholly engrossed by the acquisition of a private fortune
the former do not knowthe latter forget and the chief features of each picture are lost to them in a bewilderment of details
amongst such a people a serious demeanor ceases to be peculiar to certain men and becomes a habit of the nation
i believe the seriousness of the americans arises partly from their pride
men who live in democratic countries do not value the simple turbulent or coarse diversions in which the people indulge in aristocratic communities such diversions are thought by them to be puerile or insipid
in democratic countries even poor men entertain a lofty notion of their personal importance they look upon themselves with complacency and are apt to suppose that others are looking at them too
an aristocratic class always differs greatly from the other classes of the nation by the extent and perpetuity of its privileges but it often happens that the only differences between the members who belong to it consist in small transient advantages which may any day be lost or acquired
such is not the case with the english
no men are fonder of their own condition
nor have they a greater inclination for the intellectual and refined amusements of the aristocratic classes
she pointed into the gold cottonwood tree behind whose top we stood and said again what name
its no better than a badger hole no proper dugout at all
at that moment the father came out of the hole in the bank
it would take me a long while to explain
if theyre nice people i hate to think of them spending the winter in that cave of krajieks said grandmother
we raced off toward squaw creek and did not stop until the ground itself stoppedfell away before us so abruptly that the next step would have been out into the tree tops
in a moment we were running up the steep drawside together yulka trotting after us
well mam its politics
yulka curled up like a baby rabbit and played with a grasshopper
their agreement with him was made before they left the old country through a cousin of his who was also a relative of mrs shimerda
the road ran about like a wild thing avoiding the deep draws crossing them where they were wide and shallow
very glad very glad she ejaculated
when she coaxed and insisted i repulsed her quite sternly
as he approached us he began to make uncouth noises and held up his hands to show us his fingers which were webbed to the first knuckle like a ducks foot
occasionally one of the horses would tear off with his teeth a plant full of blossoms and walk along munching it the flowers nodding in time to his bites as he ate down toward them
ambrosch he make good farmer he struck ambrosch on the back and the boy smiled knowingly
she looked at me her eyes fairly blazing with things she could not say
my grandmother always spoke in a very loud tone to foreigners as if they were deaf
he wore no hat and his thick iron gray hair was brushed straight back from his forehead
he was nineteen years old short and broad backed with a close cropped flat head and a wide flat face
they looked calm somehow and skilled his eyes were melancholy and were set back deep under his brow
we were taking them some provisions as they had come to live on a wild place where there was no garden or chicken house and very little broken land
immediately she pointed to the bank out of which she had emerged and said house no good house no good
the oldest son ambrozthey called it ambroschcame out of the cave and stood beside his mother
grandmother nodded consolingly
he was born like that
i did nt want her ring and i felt there was something reckless and extravagant about her wishing to give it away to a boy she had never seen before
antonia reached him first took his hand and kissed it
the others are smart
she made mrs shimerda understand the friendly intention of our visit and the bohemian woman handled the loaves of bread and even smelled them and examined the pies with lively curiosity exclaiming much good much thankand again she wrung grandmothers hand
his face was ruggedly formed but it looked like asheslike something from which all the warmth and light had died out
she shook grandmothers hand energetically
presently against one of those banks i saw a sort of shed thatched with the same wine colored grass that grew everywhere
his hazel eyes were little and shrewd like his mothers but more sly and suspicious they fairly snapped at the food
the land was growing rougher i was told that we were approaching squaw creek which cut up the west half of the shimerdas place and made the land of little value for farming
even from a distance one could see that there was something strange about this boy
on sunday morning otto fuchs was to drive us over to make the acquaintance of our new bohemian neighbors
id have interfered about the horsesthe old man can understand some germanif id a thought it would do any good
they could not speak enough english to ask for advice or even to make their most pressing wants known
we drove up to this skeleton to tie our horses and then i saw a door and window sunk deep in the draw bank
i told her and she repeated the word making it sound like ice she pointed up to the sky then to my eyes then back to the sky with movements so quick and impulsive that she distracted me and i had no idea what she wanted
tatinek tatinek she shouted and we ran to meet the old man who was coming toward us
one son fuchs said was well grown and strong enough to work the land but the father was old and frail and knew nothing about farming
we clambered up to the front seat and jolted off past the little pond and along the road that climbed to the big cornfield
her face was alert and lively with a sharp chin and shrewd little eyes
we sat down and made a nest in the long red grass
they made a gold ribbon across the prairie
antonia pointed up to the sky and questioned me with her glance
i could hardly wait to see what lay beyond that cornfield but there was only red grass like ours and nothing else though from the high wagon seat one could look off a long way
name
he was neatly dressed
the door stood open and a woman and a girl of fourteen ran out and looked up at us hopefully
now why is that otto
she was quick and very eager
she was not old but she was certainly not young
grandmother looked interested
do it on your own time
hilda came to the beach with us i say
he looks at her puts his head back and goes on sleeping
when are you getting rid of these cats
thats for three years
the two stray kittens gradually make themselves at home
sorry i got sore
pop brings out the champagne and the cork blows and hits the ceiling
in that i can also choose what metropolitan area i want to be stationed in
for one thing mom really likes them
ill have to check some more says tom
hilda sits on the sofa where cat is curled up
he says hereafter i will only turn off your t v programs before they start not in the middle
doesnt pay enough pop asks
so thats what weve been talking about all evening
i get the pillows comfortably arranged on the floor with a big bottle of soda and a bag of popcorn within easy reach
i told tom we shouldnt come so late says hilda
youre getting altogether too upset about these programs
well its not just the pay
so o k go ahead you can finish it
its not a western
congratulations he says
heres to cat
pop fills little glasses for them and raises his to tom and hilda
heres to cat
well shove back the coffee cups and ill break out that bottle of champagne thats been sitting in the icebox since christmas
i say well o k
i jump up tipping over the bottle of soda on the way
pop thats not fair
thats the last straw
thats recreation not a course
hes taking the kid for a walk when a thunderstorm blows up
pop moves out of the doorway
i hardly know what starts it but a fight boils up and were both breathing fire like dragons on the loose
theres still enough left for one big glass
stop it and behave yourself
the program goes on till eleven oclock and mom wont let me watch it on school nights
i turn off the television setive lost track of whats happening and it doesnt seem to be the grandfather whos the spook after all
sohe cares
tom stirs his coffee vigorously and takes one sip and puts the cup down
therell be another western on tomorrow night
its tom and hilda is with him
i go and retrieve my spilled bottle of soda
goodness who could that be so late says mom
but anyway you shouldnt get so sore about an old television program that you shout mop it up yourself at me
huh
really
she sneaks the kittens saucers of cream and bits of real hamburger when no ones looking and she likes talking to them in the kitchen
sure
pop says you sound like the recruiting officer himself
do you good to listen to a real program for a change
its a real lemonjust a lot of preaching about government and citizenship
come in and sit down
its the first time hilda has been to our house and tom introduces her around
here davey old boy we can do better than that tonight
music he snorts
yeah its about over by now im still sore and besides pops still standing in my door so i figure theres a hitch in this somewhere
they might he grunts
ill be lucky if i have time to breathe
so we both try to do a little better and a lot of things we used to argue and fight about like my jazz records we just kid each other about now
im not fixing to start an annex to kates cat home
mr palumbo comes back to the shop then and tom gets busy with the plants
me
tom says thanks and looks at hilda and she blushes
this is o k with the schoolbut not with pop
pop doesnt look as surprised as i do
pop says hmm this time and we both stand and simmer down
as long as theres a bone on the floor the two of you worry it
we want to get married
hmm
he switches the channel
he scales his hat at the lot of them and roars down the hall to me hey davey
ive decided to enlist in the army
pop looks at me prissily
pop its a course
i go home wondering if i really am at all like pop
its a quarter to eleven
its your fault
the job isnt getting me anywhere i want to go
heres to youa long happy life
i go down to the flower shop to grouse to tom
she doesnt pick them up but just having them in the room sure doesnt give her asthma
i shout see
you think the school signs me up for an hour of home record playing
it makes me think
then theres one of those moments of complete silence with everyone looking embarrassed before we all start to speak at once
youre both impatient and curious got to poke into everything
tom wouldnt even be standing here if it wasnt for cat
the recruiting officer as a matter of fact tried to persuade me to shoot for officers training and go into the army as a career
he just likes to boss everything i do
the story starts off with some nature shots of a farm and mountains in the background and this little kid playing with his grandfather
besides says tom half the reason you and your father are always bickering is that youre so much alike
i hear the t v going for a few minutes then pop turns it off and goes in the kitchen to talk to mom
the second semester i switch to a music course
sometimes schools do let kids take a lot of soft courses and then theyre out on a limb later
tom drinks a little more coffee and then he goes on the trouble is i cant get married on this flower shop job
just as i get the t v on and settle down the doorbell rings
pop and i can go along real smooth and easy for a while and i think well he really isnt a bad guy and im growing up we can see eye to eyeall that stuff
you know id get drafted in a year or two anyway
as for keeping cats in my room thats pretty well forgotten
why does pop have to come butting into my business at school
no not if i enlist in the army
right away when i bring home my new program he says how come youre taking one less course this half
knocksthats something
he does and for once i win a roundi keep music for this semester
somehow or other cat has taught them that hes in charge here and he just chases them for fun now and again when hes not busy sleeping
pop goes to the door
go get a sponge to mop up the soda
its funny about fights
the only time we have any trouble from the cats is one evening when pop comes home and the two kittens skid down the hall between his legs with cat after them
usually he just barges in
youre not going to loaf your way through school if i have anything to say about it
well i dont think you should turn a guys t v program off in the middle without even finding out about it
loaf i yelp
its after valentines day and business is slack and the boss is out
we get a holiday washingtons birthday which is good because theres a t v program on tuesday the night before the holiday that i hardly ever get to watch
the governor and the mayor are on a t v debate about new york city school reorganization
in fact one thing this cat business seems to have established is that me and pop fighting is the main cause of moms asthma
mop it up yourself im too mad now to care what i say i charge down the hall to my room and slam the door
and there is an old story about this which i shall tell you
but some of the birds were not like him nor like the patient little wren
of course of course
i dont know anything about housekeeping and the poor silly things ruffled up their feathers and looked miserable as only a little bird can look when it is unhappy
o wise mother magpie dear mother magpie they cried teach us how to build our nests like yours for it is growing night and we are tired and sleepy
ha ha
did you ever notice how different are the nests which the birds build in springtime in tree or bush or sandy bank or hidden in the grass
and they all promised that they would
what silly birds they are she croaked
you have seen what wonderful swinging baskets the oriole makes for his baby cradle
criss cross criss cross so interrupted the wood pigeon
mother magpie snapped her eyes at him and went on next you must lay a feather on a bit of moss to start the walls
oh yes oh yes croaked old daddy crow interrupting her rudely
some do better than others but none build like mother magpie
then all the other birds chirped eagerly yes yes
she gathered turf and sticks and with clay bound them firmly together in a stout elm tree
look there he cried
about her house she built a fence of thorns to keep away the burglar birds who had already begun mischief among their peaceful neighbors
but oh
mother magpies kindergarten
let us ask her to teach us
in that lovely garden where they lived the birds went fluttering about trying their new wings so interested in this wonderful game of flying that they forgot all about preparing a home for the baby birds who were to come
she turned toward the wood pigeon who was a rattle pated young thing and who was not having any success with the sticks which she was trying to place
what a pickle the other birds were in
already she had found out a way and was busily building a famous nest for herself
and some of the birds who were attentive and careful soon saw how it was done and started nice homes for themselves
you are spoiling your nest
we all know thatanything more chirped the chorus of birds trying to conceal how anxious they were to know what came next for the nests were only half finished
the lesson was but half finished and most of them had not the slightest idea what to do next that is why to this day many of the birds have never learned to build a perfect nest
certainly of course screamed the jackdaw
mother magpie took two sticks in her beak and began like this first of all my friends you must lay two sticks crosswise for a foundation thus and she placed them carefully on the branch before her
so in a great company they came fluttering hopping twittering up to the elm tree where mother magpie nestled comfortably in her new house
but presently a sharp eyed sparrow spied mother magpie sitting in her nest
but mother magpie was thoroughly disgusted and refused to go on with the lesson which had been so rudely interrupted by her pupils
now such sad things as this happen because in their youth the lazy father and mother birds did not learn their lesson when mother magpie had her class in nest making
tell us something new
so as she went on bit by bit the silly things pretended that they had known all about it from the firstwhich was very unpleasant for their teacher
let us ask her to teach us
when these things were all piled up before her she told every bird to do just as she did
i thought that was the way to begin
sometimes after a heavy wind you find on the ground under the nest poor little broken eggs which rolled out and lost their chance of turning into birds with safe safe wings of their own
it was like a great big kindergarten of birds playing at a new building game with mother magpie for the teacher
i knew that came next that is what i told the parrot but a moment since
you say you know all about itthen go on and finish your nests by yourselves
she popped into her new house and sat there comfortably peering out through the window slits with her sharp little eyes
what would they not give for a nest like mine
she was indeed a clever bird
some are wonderfully wrought pretty little homes for birdikins
much luck may you have and away she flew to her own cosy nest in the elm tree where she was soon fast asleep forgetting all about the matter
she began to show them how to weave the bits of things together into nests as they should be made
indeed it is not a nest at all only the beginning of one
and the queerest part of all is that the birds blamed the magpie for the whole matter and have never liked her since
she was not the bestoh nobut she was the cleverest and wisest of all the birds it seemed as if she knew everything that a bird could know
but others are clumsy and carelessly fastened to the bough most unsafe cradles for the feathered baby on the treetop
mother magpie hopped up and down on one leg so angry she could hardly croak
the magpie said she would teach them if they would be a patient diligent obedient class of little birds
the clumsiest nest of all is that which the wood pigeon tries to build
oho
all except mother magpie
mother magpie has found a way
when the time came to lay their eggs the parents knew not what to do
she made them perch about her in a great circle some on the lower branches of the trees some on the bushes and some on the ground among the grass and flowers
in the early springtime of the world when birds were first made none of themexcept mother magpieknew how to build a nest
but the wood pigeon was in the worst case of them all
some of them were lazy and stupid and envious of mother magpies cosy nest which was already finished while theirs was yet to do
well it was the magpie who taught him how and he was the prize pupil to be sure
kensington gardens is almost the only place that has realised his idea of the forests of spenser and ariosto
he was resolved to avoid any explanations until he heard from lord montfort
in moments of deep feeling alike sudden bursts of prosperity as in darker hours man must be alone
and now all had ended so happily
ferdinand armine had great tenderness of disposition and somewhat of a meditative mind schooled by adversity there was little doubt that his coming career would justify his favourable destiny
that was a mad life
was it not all a dream of his own creation while his eye had been fixed in abstraction on that bright and flowing river
what a pity that instead of a princess in distress we meet only a nurserymaid
as for henrietta it seemed to him that he never could have heart to meet her again unless they were alone
a beautiful bride awaited him whom he had loved with intense passion and who he had thought but an hour ago was anothers
about the time that ferdinand directed his steps from these green retreats towards berkeley square a servant summoned miss temple to her father
only my lord with him was the reply
it was barely a year since he had returned from malta but what an eventful twelvemonth
oh could it indeed be true
how many incidents how many characters how many feelings flitted over his memory
restless with impending joy he sauntered to the bridge and leant over the balustrade gazing on the waters in charmed and charming vacancy
ferdinand armine who two days back deemed himself alone in the world
with the exception of constantinople there is no city in the world that can for a moment enter into competition with it
he could not flatter himself that he indeed merited such singular blessings and yet with all his faults which with him were but the consequences of his fiery youth ferdinand had been faithful to henrietta
everything that had occurred previously seemed of another life all his experience was concentrated in that wonderful drama that had commenced at bath the last scene of which was now approaching the characters his parents glastonbury katherine henrietta lord montfort count mirabel himself and mr temple
in exactly ten minutes it is in the power of every man to free himself from all the tumult of the world the pangs of love the throbs of ambition the wear and tear of play the recriminating boudoir the conspiring club the rattling hell and find himself in a sublime sylvan solitude superior to the cedars of lebanon and inferior only in extent to the chestnut forests of anatolia
but then there was henriettas letter
is papa alone enquired miss temple
count mirabel was the only person to whom he could abandon his soul and count mirabel was still in his first sleep
on every side the most charming retreats open to them nor is there a metropolis in the world surrounded by so many rural villages picturesque parks and elegant casinos
he might be enchanted but that was the talisman
so ferdinand entered kensington gardens and walked in those rich glades and stately avenues
it seems to the writer of this history that the inhabitants of london are scarcely sufficiently sensible of the beauty of its environs
it is here that we should get our speeches by heart invent our impromptus muse over the caprices of our mistresses destroy a cabinet and save a nation
a noble fortune which would permit him to redeem his inheritance and rank him among the richest commoners of the realm was to be controlled by one a few hours back a prisoner for desperate debts
what man in the world had friends like ferdinand armine
what a neapolitan ball was his career then
but here is the fitting and convenient locality to brood over our thoughts to project the great and to achieve the happy
in the present unsettled though hopeful state of affairs ferdinand would not go home
it requires some self communion to prepare ourselves for good fortune as well as to encounter difficulty and danger and disgrace
he seated himself on a bench and thought of henrietta temple he took out her note and read it over and over again
it was one of those soft summer mornings which are so delightful in a great city
his constancy to her was now rewarded as for his friends the future must prove his gratitude to them
ferdinand felt his freedom as well as his happiness
ah that was a name that a little disturbed him and yet he felt confidence now in mirabels prescience he could not but believe that with time even mr temple might be reconciled
on july twenty third eighteen eighty five the general surrendered to a loathsome cancer and the testimonials of devotion shown the honored dead and the bereaved family throughout the civilized world indicated the stronghold upon the hearts of the people held by the dead general
personally at this early age he detested war and was opposed to accepting the opportunity but his father persuaded him to go and his name was blunderingly registered as u s instead of h u hence he was ever after known as u s grant
they visited nearly all the countries of europe and part of those of africa and asia
on july twenty fifth eighteen sixty six he was made general of the united states army the rank having been created for him he was the first to hold it
after various flanking movements and costly assaults the problem of taking lee narrowed itself down to a siege of petersburg
ulysses simpson grant
i propose to move upon your works at once the fall of fort donelson and the capture of its garrison being the first substantial victory that had crowned the union cause together with the above described answer to general buckner brought the name of general grant prominently before the country
considering the strength of the rebel position and the difficulty of storming his intrenchments the battle of chattanooga must be considered the most remarkable in history
time wore away and on the ninth of april eighteen sixty five grant captured the confederate army under lee thus virtually ending the war
on this trip the grant party were the guests of nearly all the crowned heads of those foreign countries everywhere receiving the most exalted honors it has ever been the pleasure of an american to enjoy and on his return to the united states they were the recipients of an ovation in many of the principal cities of this country
having married a miss dent of saint louis he accordingly moved onto a farm near that city
when a man is energetic and determines to be somebody in the worldwhich is praiseworthy so long as that energy is guided by propriety and a just conception of rightthere are always scores hundreds perhaps thousands of people who endeavor to depreciate that mans reward
indeed if ever a general deserved honor grant had won it he had opened the mississippi to navigation and had captured nearly one hundred thousand prisoners and arms
when his public services were finished he started in company with his wife son jesse and a few friends
general halleck in speaking of this battle said
the scenes of his later days were clouded with the intrigues of a stock gambler but the stain that the grant ward failure seemed likely to throw on the spotless reputation of general grant was wiped away when the facts were brought to light and a new lustre was added to his fame by the self sacrifice shown in the final settlement
grant perceived that his only hope lie in literally starving the confederate army out by cutting off all resources as far as practicable
he was now commander of all the federal forces
he at once inaugurated two campaigns to be carried on at once
his success seems to have been the outgrowth of hard study and ability to perform the most exhaustive labor without fatigue
at the next republican convention grant was nominated for president on the first ballot and was elected over seymour and was reelected a second term by an increased majority
the capture of lee was a far more difficult undertaking
it will be remembered that lee and mcclellan each ranked second when they graduated
thomas l hamer he was admitted at west point in eighteen thirty nine
pittsburgh landing followed and then grant determined to take vicksburg all his generals declared the plan he proposed unmilitary and impossible but after several unsuccessful attempts the gibraltar of the mississippi was captured and this time twenty seven thousand prisoners taken
lee attempted to draw off attention toward washington but general sheridan drove early out of the shenandoah valley devastating the country to such an extent that it was impossible to forage an army there should lee attempt such a maneuver again
in eighteen forty three he graduated ranking twenty first in a class of thirty nine
now came the battle of chattanooga
after the war he was stationed at detroit and sacketts harbor but this kind of inactivity was ill suited to the restless nature of grant he therefore resigned
no other excuse can be assigned for the slander and vituperation which has from time to time been heaped upon the fair reputation of general u s grant
his first great victory was the capture of fort donelson with fifteen thousand prisoners
one under sherman against atlanta commanded by the skillful rebel general johnson the other under meade directed against lee and the confederate capitol
general grant proved to be a writer of no low order and his autobiography is a very readable book
after grant had turned the confederate right flank sherman was intercepted between longstreet and bragg thus cutting longstreet entirely out and preventing another junction being possible
when the news of the fall of fort sumter reached galena he immediately raised a company and marched to springfield where they tendered their services to the governor
the mexican war came on and grant here distinguished himself rising to the rank of captain
grant acted as mustering officer until being commissioned colonel of the twenty first illinois volunteers he took the field
resolutions of thanks were passed in ohio and new york and congress created grant a lieutenant general a commission which had been held by no one since general scott resigned
at this time grant was not taken with war and probably evinced little interest in army tactics
a person would think that after a family had lived so long in a place all the neighbors would be fond of them yet it is not so
you would think that with six legs apiece and three joints in each leg they might walk quite fast yet they never did
they thought he might be going to take a nap after his dinner then they all stood even closer together and stuck out their lower lips at him
the dragon flies may be very good peopleand even the snapping turtle says that they arestill they are so peculiar that many of their neighbors do not like them at all
the dragon flies have always lived near the pond
not the same ones that are there now of course but the great great great grandfathers of these
she was often impatient and said she could never go anywhere without one of the larvae tagging along
i tell you what lets do said another nymph
the minnow mothers did not think it was so much in the way the eggs were laid although said one i always lay mine close together instead of scattering them over the whole pond they thought the trouble came from bad bringing up or no bringing up at all
horrid old thing said one larva
indeed the lower lip of a dragon fly child might well frighten people for it is fastened on a long jointed arm like thing and has pincers on it with which it catches and holds its food
our upper lips are so small they dont matter
they always ate plain food and plenty of it and they never ate between meals
sure enough there he came through the shallow water his wet back shell partly out of it and shining in the sunlight
when they wanted to hurry they breathed this water out so suddenly that it sent them quickly ahead
the dragon fly children and the snapping turtle
i wish i could sting him
when they reached the shallow water the dragon fly children stood close together with the larvae in the middle and the nymphs all around them the snapping turtle was nowhere to be seen so they had to wait
what can you expect exclaimed one of them when dragon fly eggs are so carelessly laid
even when they are only larvae or babies they are not good playmates for they have such a bad habit of putting everything into their mouths
well our lower lips anyway answered the nymph
scared
most of the time the dragon fly child keeps the joint bent and so holds his lip up to his face like a mask
indeed the stickleback father once told the little sticklebacks that they should not stir out of the nest unless they would promise to keep away from the young dragon flies
i saw a dragon fly mother laying some only yesterday and how do you suppose she did it
when they had to they hurried in another way by taking a long leap through the water
whos afraid answered he
they had been short and plump and now they were longer and more slender and there were little bunches on their shoulders where the wings were growing under their skin
now most of the larvae were turning into nymphs which are half grown dragon flies
just flew around in the sunshine and visited with her friends and once in a while flew low enough to touch the water and drop one in
it is disgraceful
he came straight toward the dragon fly children and they were glad to see that he did not look hungry
well you cant said a nymph turning towards him so suddenly that he leaped
arent you scared whispered one larva to another
dah
their stomachs were as long as their bodies and they were never really happy unless their stomachs were full
they all put their queer little three cornered heads together and there was an ugly look in their great staring eyes
the giant water bug belostoma was the only bug who was not afraid of them when they made faces
they thought he might run away when they did this
of course they breathed water like their neighbors the fishes and the tadpoles
they knew that whenever they stuck out their lower lips at the small fishes and bugs they swam away as fast as they could
the stickleback mothers said that it was all the fault of the dragon fly mothers
but sometimes he straightens the joint and holds his lip out before him and then its pincers catch hold of things
they had breakfast from the time they awakened in the morning until the sun was high in the sky then they had dinner until the sun was low in the sky and supper from that time until it grew dark and they went to sleep but never a mouthful between meals no matter how hungry they might be
lets all go together to the shallow water where he suns himself and lets all stand close to each other and then when he comes along lets stick out our lips at him
they thought it would scare the snapping turtle dreadfully
oh look cried a nymph
they were always slow children
they had outgrown their old skins a great many times and had to wriggle out of them to be at all comfortable
they did not breathe it into their mouths or through gills but took it in through some openings in the back part of their bodies
like most growing children the dragon fly larvae and nymphs had to eat a great deal
well do it exclaimed all the dragon fly children and they started together to walk on the pond bottom to the shallow water
just you wait until i change my skin once more and then wont i have a good time
that laugh now when she doubles over at the hipswho ever heard it out of galway
a little attack of nerves possibly
mainhall laughed
she doesnt take up with anybody you know
if we had one real critic in londonbut what can one expect
hes another whos awfully keen about her
he hated them when they presumed to be anything else
sometimes a little jolt like that does one good
she hadnt much ambition then and she was too fond of trifles
she doubtless hasnt thought of me for years he felt the enthusiasm of the house at once and in a few moments he was caught up by the current of macconnells irresistible comedy
it was youth and poverty and proximity and everything was young and kindly
when they reached their box the house was darkened and the orchestra was playing the cloak of old gaul in a moment peggy was on the stage again and alexander applauded vigorously with the rest
the fact is shes feeling rather seedy poor child
he had preconceived ideas about everything and his idea about americans was that they should be engineers or mechanics
they met a good many acquaintances mainhall indeed knew almost every one and he babbled on incontinently screwing his small head about over his high collar
i dare say its quite true that theres never been any one else mainhall vouched for her constancy with a loftiness that made alexander smile even while a kind of rapid excitement was tingling through him
macconnell grunted
shes really macconnells poetic motif you see makes the whole thing a fairy tale
but i never thought shed do anything
and youll never bring hilda out like this again
all the same he lifted his glass heres to you little hilda
hilda burgoyne alexander exclaimed mildly
in the half light he looked about at the stalls and boxes and smiled a little consciously recalling with amusement sir harrys judicial frown
one of your countrymen alexander by the way an american student whom she met in paris i believe
the nephew of one of the standard victorian novelists mainhall bobbed about among the various literary cliques of london and its outlying suburbs careful to lose touch with none of them
i say
when she began to dance by way of showing the gossoons what she had seen in the fairy rings at night the house broke into a prolonged uproar
its going famously to night mac
after all we were awfully young
and have i done anything so fool as that now he asked
its tremendously well put on too
shes at her best in the second act
the ones who have any imagination do
after he met winifred pemberton he seemed to himself like a different man
mainhall liked alexander because he was an engineer
thats what i was saying mainhall lounged a little nearer and dropped into a tone even more conspicuously confidential
hilda had never replied to his letter
mainhall cut in impatiently
as they sat down a burst of applause drew alexanders attention to the stage
he had been in london more or less but he had never happened to hear of her
you see one cant be jealous about things in general but about particular definite personal thingshere she had thrown her hands up to his shoulders with a quick impulsive gestureoh about those i should be very jealous
after her dance she withdrew from the dialogue and retreated to the ditch wall back of phillys burrow where she sat singing the rising of the moon and making a wreath of primroses for her donkey
theres everything in seeing hilda while shes fresh in a part
sir harry wrinkled his brows judiciously
do you know alexandermainhall looked with perplexity up into the top of the hansom and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved fingerdo you know i sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself
blinking up at the lights mainhall added in his luxurious worldly way shes an elegant little person and quite capable of an extravagant bit of sentiment like that
macconnell let me introduce mr bartley alexander
he felt guilty and unhappy about her for a time but after winifred promised to marry him he really forgot hilda altogether
myself i always knew she had it in her
sir harry towne bowed and said that he had met mr alexander and his wife in tokyo
a man writes to the top of his bent only once
poor old hugh mainhall murmured
its only lately since macconnell and his set have got hold of her that shes come up
for some reason he felt pleased and flattered by the enthusiasm of the audience
i shouldnt wonder but theyve probably spoiled her so that shed be tiresome if one met her again
i should torture myselfi couldnt help it after that it was easy to forget actually to forget
here comes sir harry towne
shes apt to grow a bit stale after a time
he spoke with an extreme oxford accent and when he was talking well his face sometimes wore the rapt expression of a very emotional man listening to music
i shouldnt wonder if she could laugh about it with me now
i say sir harry the little girls going famously to night isnt she
she saves her hand too
when they entered the stage box on the left the first act was well under way the scene being the interior of a cabin in the south of ireland
of course hilda is irishthe burgoynes have been stage people for generationsand she has the irish voice
sir harry towne mr bartley alexander the american engineer
miss burgoyne and her donkey were thrusting their heads in at the half door after all he reflected theres small probability of her recognizing me
he had not thought of hilda burgoyne for years indeed he had almost forgotten her
why i havent heard of her foryears
and what an audience
just then they drove up to the duke of yorks so alexander did not commit himself but followed mainhall into the theatre
she must care about the theatre a great deal more than she used to
the playwright gave mainhall a curious look out of his deep set faded eyes and made a wry face
bartley smiled and yawned and went to bed
perhaps she has me to thank for something after all
he bowed as the warning bell rang and mainhall whispered you know lord westmere of coursethe stooped man with the long gray mustache talking to lady dowle
then you cant have heard much at all my dear alexander
hes hit terribly hard
let me introduce you
he nodded curtly and made for the door dodging acquaintances as he went
you see he murmured in alexanders ear as the curtain fell on the first act one almost never sees a part like that done without smartness or mawkishness
lady westmere is very fond of hilda
dear me mac the girl couldnt possibly be better you know
youll never do anything like this again mark me
youve made things come your way and i never thought youd do it
alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze
i wont promise
and ive got nobody but you
its the whole thing that troubles me hilda
i am not a man who can live two lives he went on feverishly
theres something troubling you bartley
yes i know im cowardly im afraid of myself
dont cry dont cry he whispered
then came all those years without you lonely and hurt and discouraged those decent young fellows and poor mac and me never heedinghard as a steel spring
come over to the fire youre chilled through
she looked about desperately from bartley to the door then to the windows and back again to bartley
i thought it might be sister kate or cousin mike would be happening along
i cant see you at all anywhere
oh what a grand thing to happen on a raw day
i understand bartley
she bit her lip and looked down at her hands which were clasped tightly in front of her
what i mean is that i want you to promise never to see me again no matter how often i come no matter how hard i beg
something of their troubling sweetness came back to alexander too
at last alexander brought out one word
yes i was happy wasnt i she pressed his hand gently in gratitude werent you happy then at all
the stop at queenstown the tedious passage up the mersey were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience
she closed her eyes and took a deep breath as if to draw in again the fragrance of those days
its too late to ask that
i have thought about it until i am worn out
hilda held her face back from him and began to cry bitterly
he put out his hand toward her as he looked away again into the fire
but its worse now
he moved uneasily and his chair creaked
hilda took a quick soft breath
its different now
you ask me to stay away from you because you want me
its got to be a clean break hilda
what is it
she stood over him with her hands clenched at her side her body rigid
at that word deception spoken with such self contempt the color flashed back into hildas face as suddenly as if she had been struck by a whiplash
she looked at his heavy shoulders and big determined head thrust forward like a catapult in leash
when did you come bartley and how did it happen
just something bartley
but afterward
bartley bent over and took her in his arms kissing her mouth and her wet tired eyes
i will ask the least imaginable but i must have something
it tortures me every minute
the sight of you bartley to see you living and happy and successfulcan i never make you understand what that means to me she pressed his shoulders gently
hilda sprang up like a flame
the first wassort of in play wasnt it
i felt it in my bones when i woke this morning that something splendid was going to turn up
if you come to me ill do as i see fit
he pulled up a window as if the air were heavy
the room was empty when he entered
i will do anything you saybut that
could youcould you sit down and talk about it quietly bartley as if i were a friend and not some one who had to be defied
if id met you later if i hadnt loved you so wellbut thats all over long ago
im growing older and youve got my young self here with you
hildas face quivered but she whispered yes i think it must have been
keep away if you wish when have i ever followed you
he dropped back heavily into his chair by the fire
bartley bent lower over the fire
the last two days of the voyage bartley found almost intolerable
bartley gave a bitter little laugh and hilda looked up and read in the deepening lines of his face that youth and bartley would not much longer struggle together
do you understand
it was myself i was defying hilda
she leaned her head against his arm and spoke softly
i can do that
i must have you to think of through the months and months of loneliness
the shamefulness of your asking me to do that
bartley leaned his head in his hands and spoke through his teeth
at least tell me that you believe i thought i was making you happy
i never dreamed it would be you bartley
its getting the better of me
i cant live with myself any longer he answered roughly
weve tortured each other enough for tonight
hilda watched him with perplexity
he looked at her and his haggard face softened
each life spoils the other
do you hear me bartley its too late
what must i do that ive not done or what must i not do she listened intently but she heard nothing but the creaking of his chair
i was wrong
please tell me one thing bartley
i dont trust myself any more
what about us bartley she asked in a thin voice
when marie met him at the door even her strong sense of the proprieties could not restrain her surprise and delight
a coal fire was crackling in the grate and the lamps were lit for it was already beginning to grow dark outside
alexander did not sit down
i get nothing but misery out of either
after the very first
there is this deception between me and everything
forget everything except that i am here
she crept across to him drawing her stool after her
but why do you let me chatter on like this
youve only to tell me now
he had planned to stop in liverpool but instead he took the boat train for london
i meant to but somehow i couldnt
i landed at liverpool this morning and came down on the boat train
i wanted you always to be happy and handsome and successfulto have all the things that a great man ought to have and once in a way the careless holidays that great men are not permitted
its abominable of you to ask me
she slid to the floor beside him as if she were too tired to sit up any longer
i somehow believed that i could take all the bad consequences for you
you see my mistake was in wanting you to have everything
i carried it all lightly enough at first but now i dont dare trifle with it
you havent spoken a word
when did you first begin to feel like this bartley
you want to tell me that you can only see me like this as old friends do or out in the world among people
hilda watched him from her corner trembling and scarcely breathing dark shadows growing about her eyes
he rose and pushed the chair behind him and began to walk miserably about the room seeming to find it too small for him
always
he locked and unlocked his hands over the grate and spread his fingers close to the bluish flame while the coals crackled and the clock ticked and a street vendor began to call under the window
everything
alexander groaned
hilda was pale by this time and her eyes were wide with fright
i must know about you
and then you came back not caring very much but it made no difference
but if you come to me ill do as i see fit
emerging at euston at half past three oclock in the afternoon alexander had his luggage sent to the savoy and drove at once to bedford square
i cant he said heavily
yes yes she hurried pulling her hand gently away from him presently it stole back to his coat sleeve
he ignored her question
so its better to be at the mercy of a man you dont love
i saw that interview in the paper yesterday telling where you were and i thought i had to see you
here put your feet on this stool you dont mean to say you walked downand without overshoes
did you think i had forgotten you were in town hilda
what am i to do hilda
but when i came i thought i had been mistaken
alexander flushed angrily
wont you sit down
hilda smiled up at him beautifully and put her hand on his sleeve
alexander hurried toward her and took her gently by the arm
there was something about him that made hilda wish herself at her hotel again in the street below anywhere but where she was
then when your manager added two more weeks i was already committed he dropped upon the stool in front of her and sat with his hands hanging between his knees
i didnt know it before hilda on my honor i didnt but i believe it was because deep down in me somewhere i was hoping i might drive you to do just this
i suppose i would better do it without telling you
it was furnished with the cast off possessions of his bachelor days and with odd things which he sheltered for friends of his who followed itinerant and more or less artistic callings
it was after nine oclock and he was lighting a second pipe when he thought he heard a sound at his door he started and listened holding the burning match in his hand again he heard the same sound like a firm light tap
over the fireplace there was a large oldfashioned gilt mirror
thats all
if youd sent me a note or telephoned me or anything
dont be any more angry than you can help
but its no use talking about that now
his business often called him to new york and he had kept an apartment there for years subletting it when he went abroad for any length of time
chapter nine
ive been through this a hundred times to day
but you wont let me write to you and i had to see you after that letter that terrible letter you wrote me when you got home
she felt the strength leap in the arms that held her so lightly
she looked up into his eyes and hid her face in her hands
of course i know bartley she said at last that after this you wont owe me the least consideration
who
and he threw it back at me a second time
he was standing behind the table turning over a pile of blueprints nervously
it was to have reached you on the steamer
arent you trying to frighten me
when alexander came back from dinner he put more wood on his fire made himself comfortable and settled down at his desk where he began checking over estimate sheets
only not mac
i told myself that if i were really thinking of you and not of myself a letter would be better than nothing
and i she whisperedi felt that you were feeling that
let me take off your coatand your boots theyre oozing water he knelt down and began to unlace her shoes while hilda shrank into the chair
give me my things please she put her hand out toward the fender
they never did to me
one of them
alexander sat down on the arm of her chair
i was all right until i knew you were in town
i think i have felt that you were coming he bent his face over her hair
he got up and went over to the window threw it open and leaned out
only ill do it more completely
is this the way you mean to answer it hilda he asked unsteadily
but afterward i shant have an opportunity to explain for i shant be seeing you again
alexander moved restlessly
im going to marry
cant you see bartley that im terribly frightened
marks on paper mean something to you he paused
are you joking hilda
she was afraid to look up at him
on the last saturday in april the new york times published an account of the strike complications which were delaying alexanders new jersey bridge and stated that the engineer himself was in town and at his office on west tenth street
you see you are different hilda
when he looked over his shoulder she was lacing her boots
dont do anything like that rashly his face grew troubled you wouldnt be happy
i dont know what i ought to say but i dont believe youd be happy truly i dont
did you write to me
ive jumped up if the fire crackled
try him once again
i came to tell you that im willing to do as you asked me
ive watched that door all day
she tied the knot of the last lacing and put her boot heel down firmly no im telling you what ive made up my mind to do
hilda hid her face in her hands
ive been up in canada with my bridge and i arranged not to come to new york until after you had gone
but we sail on tuesday
then i wouldnt have come
under such circumstances infinitely
its because they cant be at the mercy of the man they love any longer
there is a letter for you there in my desk drawer
you are not that kind of woman
the yellow light from the students lamp fell on his hands and the purple sleeves of his velvet smoking jacket but his flushed face and big hard head were in the shadow
sit down hilda youre wet through
alexanders big work table stood in front of one of the three windows and above the couch hung the one picture in the room a big canvas of charming color and spirit a study of the luxembourg gardens in early spring painted in his youth by a man who had since become a portrait painter of international renown
besides his sleeping room and bath there was a large room formerly a painters studio which he used as a study and office
thats what i wanted to see you about bartley
im too fond of him
hilda youd better think a while longer before you do that
when hilda rose he sat down on the arm of her chair and drew her back into it
she closed her eyes her lips and eyelids trembled
indeed im not
only one
try him again hilda
he rose and crossed the room quickly
alexander started up and began to walk up and down the room
he heard hilda moving about behind him
alexander started to speak but caught himself
oh it doesnt matter much
he stood for a moment in awkward constraint his pipe in his hand
good night im going now she turned and her hand closed on the door knob
i was afraid to take a cab
he pointed to a chair by the fire and went back to his worktable
come in he said to hilda at last and closed the door behind her

ah father said hansel i am looking at my white cat sitting upon the roof of the house and trying to say good bye
be quiet grethel said he do not cryi will help you and as soon as their parents had gone to sleep he got up put on his coat and unbarring the back door went out
we are going into the forest to hew wood and in the evening when we are ready we will come and fetch you again
oh how horribly the witch howled but grethel ran away and left her to burn to ashes
they knocked at the door and when the wife opened it and saw hansel and grethel she exclaimed you wicked children
why did you sleep so long in the wood
as soon as it was noon they saw a beautiful snow white bird sitting upon a bough singing so sweetly that they stood still and listened to it
come in and stop with me and no harm shall come to you and so saying she took them both by the hand and led them into her cottage
they waited so long that at last their eyes closed from weariness and they fell fast asleep
had we only been eaten by the wild beasts in the wood then we should have died together but the old witch called out leave off that noise it will not help you a bit
the next morning before the sun arose the wife went and awoke the two children
hansel thought the roof tasted very nice and so he tore off a great piece while grethel broke a large round pane out of the window and sat down quite contentedly
we cannot get over said hansel i can see no bridge at all and there is no boat either said grethel but there swims a white duck i will ask her to help us over and she sang
you simpleton said the wife that is not a cat it is only the sun shining on the white chimney but in reality hansel was not looking at a cat but every time he stopped he dropped a pebble out of his pocket upon the path
when they had gone a little distance hansel stood still and peeped back at the house and this he repeated several times till his father said hansel what are you looking at and why do you lag behind
a good meal of milk and pancakes with sugar apples and nuts was spread on the table and in the back room were two nice little beds covered with white where hansel and grethel laid themselves down and were happy as could be
first we will bake however said the old woman i have already heated the oven and kneaded the dough and so saying she pushed poor grethel up to the oven out of which the flames were burning fiercely
hansel why do you stop and look about said the father keep in the path i am looking at my little dove answered hansel nodding a good bye to me simpleton said the wife that is no dove but only the sun shining on the chimney but hansel kept still dropping crumbs as he went along
so he sprang out like a bird from his cage when the door was opened and they were so glad that they fell upon each others neck and kissed each other over and over again
we must be off now said hansel and get out of this enchanted forest but when they had walked for two hours they came to a large piece of water
oh you simpleton said she then we must all four die of hunger you had better plane the coffins for us but she left him no peace till he consented saying ah but i shall miss the poor children
then grethel gave her a push so that she fell right in and shutting the iron door bolted it
see i could even get in myself and she got up and put her head into the oven
hansel and grethel
once upon a time there dwelt near a large wood a poor wood cutter with his wife and two children by his former marriage a little boy called hansel and a girl named grethel
so a nice meal was cooked for hansel but grethel got nothing else but a crabs claw
grethel wept bitterly and said to hansel what will become of us
nevertheless he comforted grethel saying do not weep sleep in quiet the good god will not forsake us
he had little enough to break or bite and once when there was a great famine in the land he could hardly procure even his daily bread and as he lay thinking in his bed one night he sighed and said to his wife what will become of us how can we feed our children when we have no more than we can eat ourselves
the children however had heard the conversation as they lay awake and as soon as their parents went to sleep hansel got up intending to pick up some pebbles as before but the wife had locked the door so that he could not get out
but her husband felt heavy at heart and thought it were better to share the last crust with the children his wife however would listen to nothing that he said and scolded and reproached him without end
will they not be sweet so hansel reached up and broke a piece off the roof in order to see how it tasted while grethel stepped up to the window and began to bite it
little duck good little duck grethel and hansel together we stand there is neither stile nor bridge take us on your back to land
no wife replied he that i can never do how can you bring your heart to leave my children all alone in the wood for the wild beasts will soon come and tear them to pieces
these are better than pebbles said hansel putting as many into his pocket as it would hold while grethel thought i will take some home too and filled her apron full
we thought you were never coming home again but their father was extremely glad for it had grieved his heart to leave them all alone
hansel kept saying to grethel we will soon find the way but they did not and they walked the whole night long and the next day but still they did not come out of the wood and they got very hungry for they had nothing to eat but the berries which they found upon the bushes
dear good god help us now she prayed
then they set fire to them and as the flame burnt up high the wife said now you children lie down near the fire and rest yourselves whilst we go into the forest and chop more wood when we are ready we will come and call you
take care and remember your legs
soon they were so tired that they could not drag themselves along then they lay down under a tree and again went to sleep
it was now the third morning since they had left their fathers house and they still walked on but they only got deeper and deeper and deeper into the wood and hansel felt that if help did not come very soon they must die of hunger
when noon came grethel shared her bread with hansel who had strewn his on the path
and now as there was nothing to fear they went back to the witchs house where in every corner were caskets full of pearls and precious stones
just then the door opened and a very old woman walking upon crutches came out
on the way hansel broke his in his pocket and stopping every now and then dropped a crumb upon the path
we will go in here said hansel and have a glorious feast
no replied grethel that will be too much for the duck she shall take us over one at a time
then they began to run and rushing into the house they fell upon their fathers neck
now she ran to hansel and opening the door called out hansel we are saved the old witch is dead
hansel and grethel sat down by the fire and when it was noon each ate the piece of bread and because they could hear the blows of an axe they thought their father was near but it was not an axe but a branch which he had bound to an old tree so as to be blown to and fro by the wind
this the good little bird did and when both were happily arrived on the other side and had gone a little way they came to a wellknown wood which they knew the better every step they went and at last they perceived their fathers house
every morning the old witch came to the cage and said hansel stretch out your finger that i may feel whether you are getting fat but hansel used to stretch out a bone and the old woman having very bad sight thought it was his finger and wondered very much why he did not get fat
hansel and grethel were so much frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands but the old woman nodding her head said ah you dear children what has brought you here
he who says a must say b too and he who consents the first time must also the second
i will eat a piece of the roof and you can eat the window
witches have red eyes and cannot see very far but they have a fine sense of smelling like wild beasts so that they know when children approach them
so the duck came to them and hansel sat himself on and bade his sister sit beside him
when they awoke it was quite dark and grethel began to cry
all night long they walked on and as day broke they came to their fathers house
early in the morning the stepmother came and pulled them out of bed and gave them each a slice of bread which was still smaller than the former piece
so early in the morning grethel was compelled to go out and fill the kettle and make a fire
go back to the regiment he said smiling all will be needed
yet it looked very bad for us
nine oclock came and now we knew that the great assault was to be made
had he done so all would have been killed on the morrow
at last the chance came and for my regiment it was an awful onethe battle of iuka
the moon shone so brightly the men in the lines tired though they were could scarcely sleep
iuka the fiercest battle of the war two hundred seventeen men out of four hundred eighty two of my regiment are shotthe awful rebel charge at corinthmoonlight on the battlefieldbushels of arms and legstombstones for fireplacesone of grants mistakes
the cloud of rebels we had seen divided itself into three columns
the night before the battle of corinth the fifth iowa regiment lay across the purdy road in the bright moonlight
my friend with many others was being carried out to die elsewhere
suddenly we heard something almost like a distant whirlwind
it was a strange horrible sightbut it was war
even a foe could feel pity to see brave men so cruelly slaughtered
and so it was that within two weeks my regiment was placed outside the breastworks at corinth to wait and receive another awful assault
the enemy had not had time to bury them
while mothers and sisters at home were praying for the safety of these dear ones at the front their spirits that night were leaving their torn bodies in the dark and ascending heavenward
indeed we of the rank and file had little confidence in grant in those days
that evening an order came for ushamiltons divisionto assault the enemys left flank at midnight
never will i forget the horrible scenes of that night
the enemy lost more than one thousand men in trying to destroy that single brigade and its ohio battery
we now camped on the edge of the town and went on building still other and greater forts
the woods were in their fairest foliage and it seemed too lovely a day for war and bloodshed
one morning before daylight while camped in the woods near jacinto half expecting to be attacked we heard that prices army was in iuka some eighteen miles away and that if we would hurry there and attack from one side general grant with ords troops would attack from another side
our own division though fighting some had lost but few men
one daring rebel was shot down and bayoneted clear behind the line of company b where he had broken through to seize the flag of my regiment
these recklessly advanced on the forts climbing over the fallen trees and bending their heads against the awful storm of grape and canister from all our cannon
there were simply bushels of them and the floor was running blood
it was fought by a handful of the troops of general rosecrans against half the army of general price
the bugles played occasionally as the men hurried along but not a shot was fired
there were no breastworks yet that one little brigade of hamiltons division stood there in the open and repulsed assault after assault
that order was one of the mistakes of grants earlier days as a commander
with a few lanterns our men then went about and tried to gather up the wounded the dead were left till morning
at another spot one hundred eighty two rebel corpses lay in a row covered by tarpaulins
my canteen was full of water and i pressed it to the lips of many a dying enemyenemy no longer
our regiment now pursued the flying rebels with great vigor
that night i stood guard under an oak tree on the battlefield among the unburied dead
my own regiment was in the advance
our grape shot had torn whole companies of men to pieces
it was too late for he was dying
we looked for it against our own division as we lay in the grass waiting
once in the night i slipped away from the bivouac and hurried to the old tishimingo hotel to see a lieutenant of my company who had been shot through the breast
as i entered the building a cannonball from the enemy crashed through the house and killed four soldiers by the stairway
many of the wounded even had not yet been gathered up
another had taken his fine gold watch
the rebels were charging works that they themselves had built when they held the town during hallecks siege general haccelman and many other of our officers had fallen
there were seven hundred eighty two union men lying there in their blood that long night six hundred eight of them out of a single small brigade
we reflected that at shiloh he was miles away from the battlefield at the critical moment
it was lieutenant william dodd a classmate in school
rosecrans protested
all that summer after taking corinth we chased up and down the state of mississippi trying to get fair battle with the rebel army
at corinth he was forty miles away and now when we had the enemy almost within our grasp he suddenly called us back
the burying party the next morning found nineteen dead rebels lying together at one place
the pursuit of the enemy was being pushed with vigor when the army was ordered to desist and return to camp
charge after charge was made upon our little line and the eleventh ohio battery which the regiment was protecting was taken and retaken three times
at iuka grant though commander did not even know a battle was going on
our own loss had been two thousand two hundred dead and wounded
not balaklava nor the alma saw such fighting
our brigade was fearfully outnumbered rosecrans had ten thousand soldiers within five miles of the battlefield yet let three or four small regiments and a battery do all the fighting
how little anyone dreamed that before the sun set two hundred seventeen of that little command would be stretched dead or dying among the autumn leaves
it was the storming of fort robinett
it required months and great events to make grant the hero of the army which he afterward became
general rogers who had led a brigade into the hopeless pit lay on his back dead with his flag in his hand
they lay in heaps of dozens even close up to the works
god could not answer the prayers of the men in both armies that night
yes it was hell i hastened back to the lines
it was soon full day
all the night we lay there under the brightest moonlight i ever saw
how eagerly the regiment made the forward march on that beautiful autumn day
every house in town was full of our wounded and our dead lay everywhere
possibly the best friend i had in the world save my kin was killed at that bridge
the town seemed full of the groans of dying men
the order more imperative than before was repeated
instantly we changed direction a little and without further firing witnessed one of the greatest assaults of any war
under the same quiet moonlight and only six hundred yards away from us also lay the victorious rebel army
brick was scarce and in a few instances the men used the stone slabs from a graveyard close at hand
that night the enemy slipped away leaving hundreds and hundreds of his dead and wounded on the field
there were only four hundred eighty two of my little regiment now marching there hoping almost praying the enemy might only wait
it was the iowa the missouri and the ohio boys against the boys of alabama and mississippi and the grass and leaves were covered with the bodies in blue and gray
five of my eight messmates of the day before were shot
fifteen officers of our little half regiment were dead or wounded
antietam gettysburg the wilderness could show nothing like it only the setting sun put an end to what was part of the time a hand to hand conflict
when the assault had failed and the noise of battle was stilled i hurried down in front of robinett
they had time for reflection as they marched and they knew now they were going to battle
poor jimmy king he survived the war only to be murdered later on a plantation in mississippi
rosecrans is at present the hero of this army and with him leading it the boys would storm hades
in one of the rooms i saw the floors tables and chairs covered with amputated limbs some white and some broken and bleeding
a perfect blaze of close range musketry too mowed them down like grass
it was an astounding order as it was in our power to destroy the defeated and flying columns
it was a relief to me to get back into the moonlight and out of the horror yet out there lay thousands of others in line only waiting the daylight to be also mangled and torn like these
for some reason the dead at hatchie bridge were not buried
on inquiry for certain ones i learned that they were dead and lying out in the improvised graveyard near by
before the hour came however the move was decided to be too dangerous and we changed our position to one nearer the forts
when morning came the firing opened and for all that day the battle raged fiercely at the left and center left we getting the worst of it too
many of the soldiers made huts for themselves
his head was shot off by a cannonball just as his regiment was charging at the bridge
my regiment rose to its feet fired a few moments at scattering rebels in our front and were amazed to see a great black column ten thousand strong moving like a mighty storm cloud out of the woods and attacking the forts and troops at our left
it was getting cooler now and little fireplaces were built in the huts and tents
ten miles away in another direction lay general grant and general ord with many other thousands as silent as if paralyzed an unlucky wind blew they said and the sound of our cannon that was to have been the signal for them to attack also was unheard by them
it was just two oclock when the regiment ran on to the army of the enemy lying in line right across the road close to iuka
sherman had saved the union army from destruction there
it is not for the youngest and most childish one of us to make the plans she said
she was as completely unconscious as her sister
its surely a terrible storm outside said the merchants eldest daughter as the wind rattled the tiles of the roof and the rain beat in torrents against the doors and windows
the eldest daughter blushed and hung her head
the doors were strong and held securely
be sure that you admit no one commanded the merchant
when the merchant had heard the whole story he said after this we must all give ear to the wisdom of this little maid
the little girl flew down the stairs and closed the doors of the store securely
now outside this city there was a band of bold robbers
every year at a certain day of a certain month he went away to a distant city to collect money on an account
i am thinking that our dear father would be anxious if he knew that we had broken our promise so easily said the youngest sister
i do not trust your promises replied the little maid
we two are older and wiser than you are it is for us to determine what shall be done
oh why didnt we keep our promise to our father cried the middle one
his wife and daughters remained at home and all went well until one sad day the wife died
our father has always taught us to show mercy and kindness to the aged
he is old as well as poor she said
the youngest sister peeped through her long heavy eyelashes and watched the beggar
if we decide to show mercy to this poor beggar it is not for you to oppose it
the captain of the band had watched the merchants departure and when he was safely away the thief dressed himself in the disguise of an old beggar when it was evening he led his band into a nearby street and in his disguise approached the merchants house
thanks to our youngest sister we are safe
it was the youngest one who deceived me cried the robber chieftain i knew all the time that she did not want to let me in
we can give this poor beggar some alms and send him away with a blessing
great danger threatened us while you were away she said
she may not be so wise as she appears
she did not stir and he knew that the sleeping powder had thoroughly done its work
then you can pull my charm out in safety
she quickly ran upstairs and got the robbers sword which he had left on a chair in the dining room
the beggar entered the room
however in spite of all she could say the elder sisters opened the door and admitted the beggar
the man went to the bed of the eldest sister and stuck a pin into her foot to see if she were completely unconscious
the second daughter added
then she heard him go down the stairway and unbolt the heavy doors which led into the store
the youngest one was so frightened that she could not sleep a single wink
i have left my charm behind he cried
soon she heard footsteps outside
they were big and heavy but her great fear gave her strength
as soon as they had eaten the girls went to their room and the two eldest were overcome with sleep almost before they had time to get into bed
the merchants daughter at first did not answer but as he kept on calling to her she finally asked him what it was that he wanted
put your hand through the hole in the door replied the little maid then ill give you your charm
its in the fire replied the girl
our little sister was wiser than we were said the middle daughter
it was not until their little sister had shown them the robbers hand and the great sword that they were convinced that she had told them the truth
it is a fearful night to send away a beggar said the eldest sister while they were eating
you are making it up
she knew that the thief had brought back others with him
how do you know asked their father
when they heard their sisters story they were filled with amazement
she struck it with all her might with the great sword and cut it off
i cannot bear to go away he said to them
have pity upon a poor unfortunate one he called out
that year the merchant looked forward to his journey with dread for he would have to leave his daughters alone
now it happened that there was a little hole in the door just large enough for a mans hand to enter
do not be afraid to leave us dear father said his daughters nothing will harm us while you are away
we can lock ourselves securely in the house and not let any one enter said the three daughters
i was suspicious of her from the first
they gave him their promise and he started on his journey nevertheless he went with an anxious heart
the youngest one pretended that she too was asleep
she was so terribly frightened that it was all she could do to keep her teeth from chattering
then he went to the bed of the second sister and did the same
they led him into the kitchen to dry his clothes
you shall not come into my fathers house
she threw the apple away
long ago there lived a merchant who had three daughters
in the morning the effect of the sleeping powder wore off and the two elder sisters awoke
i see that no harm befell you in my absence he said as he embraced them fondly
they gave him his supper in the kitchen and then they ate their own
let me enter i pray you to pass the night under your roof
go throw vinegar on the fire and put it out said the captain of the thieves
pray let me enter to get it i promise you i will do you no harm
however the question of leaving three such pretty girls unprotected was a thing not to be regarded lightly
my heart is filled with fear lest some evil may befall you during my absence
pass the charm out to me then said the robber
the eldest daughter frowned
he knocked at the door
remember our promise to our father cried the youngest one
the robber thought that she was as completely overcome by the sleeping powder as the others
for shame cried the eldest
at last it was daylight and the band of thieves had to flee
it hurt terribly when he stuck the pin into the foot of the youngest but she did not stir
the second daughter peeped out of the window at the beggar
hell find it difficult to get into our house again she said to herself as she waited to see if the robber returned
i dont believe a word of it cried the oldest
the cries and curses of the robbers filled the air
i am older and wiser than you are and i know that there are many evils which might come upon you there are many bold thieves in this city for instance who would be only too ready to take advantage of my absence and rob my home of all i possess
they tried in vain to break down the great doors
all my worries about you were foolish
she saw to her surprise that he had laid aside the heavy ragged old coat which he had kept wrapped about him even while he ate underneath he was dressed like a robber with a sword pistols and dagger
he worried about the matter night and day
i had such a nightmare myself that i have a headache this morning
soon she heard footsteps
when at last the merchant returned from the distant city where he had been to collect money he was delighted to find his house and his three daughters safe
the leader of the band of thieves went up close to the keyhole and whispered kind lady of the house have pity on me
the two eldest ate their apples but the youngest could not eat that night
while they were talking the beggar had taken the apples which the girls were to eat for dessert and had sprinkled a sleeping powder over them
perhaps you can
how quickly he disappeared
the weapon must still have been there
but the blood
yes
so they tell me
what do you make of it gryce
the task of the translator and with all humility be it spoken is one of some self denial
then when i say dear song i know i add a stanza as it were handmaid to the others wherein i say what i desire from this my poem
the second begins here an angel the third here dear song i know the first part is divided into four
the poem begins here
whereupon i declare that my tongue spake as though by its own impulse and said ladies that have intelligence in love these words i laid up in my mind with great gladness conceiving to take them as my commencement
the second begins here and i declare the third here wherefore i will not speak the fourth here with you alone then when i say an angel i begin treating of this lady and this part is divided into two
the third is as it were a handmaid to the preceding words
in the first i say to whom i mean to speak of my lady and wherefore i will so speak
in the third i say what it is i purpose to speak so as not to be impeded by faintheartedness
thereafter this sonnet bred in me desire to write down in verse four other things touching my condition the which things it seemed to me that i had not yet made manifest
and when i had come close up with them and perceived that they had not among them mine excellent lady i was reassured and saluted them asking of their pleasure
and i said these four things in a sonnet which is this
through the sore change in mine aspect the secret of my heart was now understood of many
and as i was going that way by chance but i think rather by the will of fortune i heard one of them call unto me and she that called was a lady of very sweet speech
then i being almost put to shame because of her answer went out from among them and as i walked i said within myself seeing that there is so much beatitude in those words which do praise my lady wherefore hath my speech of her been different and then i resolved that thenceforward i would choose for the theme of my writings only the praise of this most gracious being
the second is the matter treated of
but when i still spake not one of them who before had been talking with another addressed me by my name saying to what end lovest thou this lady seeing that thou canst not support her presence
the first part is a proem to the words following
and that every vicious thought may be discarded herefrom let the reader remember that it is above written that the greeting of this lady which was an act of her mouth was the goal of my desires while i could receive it
in the first i tell what is understood of her in heaven
and for that the occasion of what i then wrote may be found pleasant in the hearing i will relate it as briefly as i may
but albeit i spake not to her again yet it behoved me afterward to write of another matter more noble than the foregoing

organ of rut not reason is the lord who from the body politic doth drain lust for himself instead of toil and pain leaving us lean as crickets on dry sward well too if he like love would filch our hoard with pleasure to ourselves sluicing our vein and vigour to perpetuate the strain of life by spilth of life within us stored loves cheat yields joy and profit

twenty three
the choice of arms was thine yet art thou scoffed at by the crucified he livesthy loss
she that was thine excellent lady hath been taken out of life then i began to weep very piteously and not only in mine imagination but with mine eyes which were wet with tears
a few days after this my body became afflicted with a painful infirmity whereby i suffered bitter anguish for many days which at last brought me unto such weakness that i could no longer move
in the first speaking to a person undefined i tell how i was aroused from a vain phantasy by certain ladies and how i promised them to tell what it was
just then you woke me of your complaisaunce
the second part begins here saying be now the third here then while it was his pleasure the third part divides into two
and i remember that on the ninth day being overcome with intolerable pain a thought came into my mind concerning my lady but when it had a little nourished this thought my mind returned to its brooding over mine enfeebled body
the second part begins here i was a thinking the first part divides into two
and as i said these words with a painful anguish of sobbing and another prayer unto death a young and gentle lady who had been standing beside me where i lay conceiving that i wept and cried out because of the pain of mine infirmity was taken with trembling and began to shed tears
and so strong was my phantasy that i wept again in very truth and said with my true voice o excellent soul how blessed is he that now looketh upon thee
after this empty imagining it happened on a day as i sat thoughtful that i was taken with such a strong trembling at the heart that it could not have been otherwise in the presence of my lady
and i became so humble in my grief seeing in her such deep humility that i said death i hold thee passing good henceforth and a most gentle sweet relief since my dear love has chosen to dwell with thee pity not hate is thine well understood lo
then my heart that was so full of love said unto me it is true that our lady lieth dead and it seemed to me that i went to look upon the body wherein that blessed and most noble spirit had had its abiding place
whereby other ladies who were about the room becoming aware of my discomfort by reason of the moan that she made who indeed was of my very near kindred led her away from where i was and then set themselves to awaken me thinking that i dreamed and saying sleep no longer and be not disquieted
in the second i tell what these ladies said to me after i had left off this wandering and it begins here but uttered in a voice then when i say i was a thinking i say how i told them this my imagination and concerning this i have two parts
wherefore come now unto me who do greatly desire thee seest thou not that i wear thy colour already and when i had seen all those offices performed that are fitting to be done unto the dead it seemed to me that i went back unto mine own chamber and looked up towards heaven
also after i had recovered from my sickness i bethought me to write these things in rhyme deeming it a lovely thing to be known
a short while after these words which my heart spoke to me with the tongue of love i saw coming towards me a certain lady who was very famous for her beauty and of whom that friend whom i have already called the first among my friends had long been enamoured
in the second i say how i told them
i do so desire to see thy face that i am like as one who nears the tomb my soul entreats thee come then i departed having made my moan and when i was alone i said and cast my eyes to the high place blessed is he fair soul who meets thy glance
the third tells how after he had in such wise been with me a space i saw and heard certain things
whereof i wrote this poem
in the first i tell in order this imagination
the second says how it appeared to me that love spake within my heart and what was his aspect
i smile at your question was the answer of the wind
alas what he said was true and before many days had passed the shattered carnations were rotted with lying in the wet and dirt on the ground
the convolvulus fared still worse
indeed not a flower escaped his mischievous suggestions
the white lily still stood somewhat upright though no friendly pole supported her juicy stem but alas it was only by a painful effort she could hold herself in that position
i am not thinking about the garden mamma replied the young girl without lifting up her face we can plant new flowers and tie up even some of these afresh
not more than mine does cried the proud white lily leaning as heavily as she could against the strip of matting that tied her to her stick
then the wind took another frolic round the garden and made up to the large white lily into whose refined ear he whispered a doubt as to the necessity or advantage of her thick powerful stem being propped up against a stupid ugly stick
sometimes she takes a turn upon the ground sometimes she enters a hedge and plays at bo peep with the birds in the thorn and nut treestwisting here curling there and at last perhaps coming out at the top and overhanging the edge with a canopy of green leaves and pretty white flowers
making a sort of eddying circuit round the garden he knocked over the convolvulus pole tore the strips from the stick that held up the white lily loosed all the carnation flowers from their fastenings broke the rose tree down and levelled the sweet peas to the ground
really with your natural grace and beauty i think you might be trusted to yourself a little more
now the convolvulus was quite abashed by the words of the wind for she was conscious of feeling very conceited that morning in consequence of having heard the gardener say something very flattering about her beauty so she hung down her rich bell flowers rather lower than usual and made no reply
before the day closed the gardener came whistling from his farm work to look over his pretty charges
perhaps i am prejudiced but as to be deprived of freedom would be to me absolute death so my soul revolts from every shape and phase of slavery
but for the sight that awaited him he was not prepared at all struck dumb with astonishment he never spoke at first but kept lifting up the heads of the trailing dirtied flowers in succession
in short in one half hour he desolated the pretty garden and when his work was accomplished he flew off
to which the wicked wind seeing that his temptations had succeeded replied in great glee that he would do his best and so he went away chuckling at the discontent he had caused
but i cannot say so now i see the result
presently with sorrowing steps she bent her way round the flower beds weeping afresh at every one she looked at and then she sat down upon the lawn and hid her face in her hands in this position she remained until a gentle hand was laid upon her shoulder
the wind and the flowers
this is a sad sight indeed my darling said her mothers voice
then the white lily called out to him in great wrath and told him he mistook their characters altogether
at length one day before the fortnight was over the house dog was heard to bark his noisy welcome and servants bustled to and fro the mistress had returned and the young lady was with her and hurried at once to her favourite garden
and what is the matter with the beautiful straggling branches that they are to be cut off as fast as they appear
i have been watching your friend the gardener for some time to day and now that he is gone at last i am quite curious to hear what you think and feel about your unnatural bringing up
why must every single flower betied up by its delicate neck to a stick the moment it begins to open
by mrs alfred gatty
she came bounding towards the wellknown spot with a song of joyous delight but on reaching it suddenly stopped short and in a minute after burst into a flood of tears
with my natural grace and beauty repeated she to herself they might certainly trust me to myself a little more
why not allow the healthy rose tree its free and glorious growth
the honeysuckle escaped no better and the carnation was ready to die of vexation at finding that her coveted freedom had levelled her to the dirt
oh that she were once more climbing up the friendly fir pole
weeds meanwhile sprang up and a dreary confusion reigned in the once orderly and brilliant little garden
the wind was scarcely gone before a sudden and heavy rain followed so that all was confusion for some time
my young plants require heat or they would not live and the pots we are kept in protect us from those cruel wire worms who delight to destroy our roots
but towards the evening the weather cleared up and our friends began to look around them
he murmured among them alllaughed the trim cut box edges to scornmaliciously hoped the sweet peas enjoyed growing in a circle and running up a quantity of crooked sticksand told the flowers generally that he should report their unheard of submission and meek obedience wherever he went
you surely cannot suppose that in a natural state you would be forced to climb regularly up one tall bare stick such as i see you upon now
i quite feel for you
they only submitted to these degrading restraints because they could not help themselves but if he would lend them his powerful aid they might free themselves from at least a part of the unnatural bonds which enthralled them
he really grieved to see it
she felt the muddy weight as it soaked into her beautiful velvet bells and could have cried for grief she could never free herself from this nuisance
why not allow your silver tufts to luxuriate in a natural manner
the garden beds sloped towards the south and when our friend was laid on the earthher pole having fallenher lovely flowers were choked up by the wet soil which drained towards her
he managed the affair very cleverly it must be confessed
she runs along and climbs about just as the whim takes her
oh rose tree you know your own surpassing merits too well to make you think this possible
and so she did and a new light seemed to dawn upon her as she recollected the spring and autumnal prunings she regularly underwent and the quantities of little branches that were yearly cut from her sides and carried away in a wheel barrow
always this tying up and restraint pursued the wind with an angry puff
i am not aware that i have any poor relations in this country and i myself certainly require all the care that is bestowed upon me this climate is both too cold and too damp for me
its all over with them i fear and the gardener went his way
meanwhile how fared it with the flowers
and the carnation began to think so too and her colour turned deeper as a feeling of indignation arose within her at the childish treatment to which she had been subjected
what a fuss is made about you my dear little friends murmured the wind one day to the flowers in a pretty villa garden
did that lovely creature suppose that nature who had done so much for her that the fame of her beauty extended throughout the world had yet left her so weak and feeble that she could not support herself in the position most calculated to give her ease and pleasure
what a difference in size in colour and in fragrance
it is rather a silly thing to do said deucalion and yet there can be no harm in it and we shall see what will happen
and yet what could he mean by the bones of our mother
perhaps he meant the stones of the earth said pyrrha
is there anything that you wish he asked
these men he said to his mighty company are nothing but a source of trouble
when they were good and happy we felt afraid lest they should become greater than ourselves and now they are so terribly wicked that we are in worse danger than before
once every year he had gone to the land of the caucasus to talk with his father who was hanging chained to the mountain peak
let us go on down the mountain and as we go let us pick up the stones in our path and throw them over our shoulders behind us
but let us think a moment
while they were talking and trying to think what they should do they heard a voice behind them
surely i do not know said deucalion
be sure that you are ready for it my son
who is our mother if it is not the earth from whom all living things have sprung
he drew near trembling and wondering and knelt beside her
the king in hopes of preventing what the old fairy had foretold immediately issued an edict by which he forbade all persons in his dominion from spinning or even having spindles in their houses under pain of instant death
then the prince took the princess by the hand she was dressed in great splendour but he did not hint that she looked as he had seen pictures of his great grandmother look he thought her all the more charming for that
the turn of the old fairy had now come and she declared while her head shook with malice that the princess should pierce her hand with a spindle and die of the wound this dreadful fate threw all the company into tears of dismay when the young fairy who had hidden herself came forward and said
when they left the castle the next day to return to the princes home they were followed by all the retinue of the princess
the young prince at these words felt himself on fire
he walked toward the castle which appeared now at the end of a long avenue but when he turned to look for his followers not one was to be seen the woods had closed instantly upon him as he had passed through
his steps resounded as he passed over the marble pavement and up the marble staircase
the son of the king was hunting one day when he discovered the towers of the castle above the tops of the trees and asked what castle that was
the king looked sorrowfully upon her
how do you do it
the prince did not know what to believe when finally an old peasant said
it is true i cannot entirely undo what my elder has done
outside they met the princes followers who were overjoyed to see their master he turned to show them the castle but behold there was no castle to be seen and no wood castle and wood had vanished but the prince and princess went gayly away and when the old king and queen died they reigned in their stead
when at last the queen gave birth to a daughter the king was so overjoyed that he gave a great christening feast the like of which had never before been known
once upon a time there was a king and a queen who grieved sorely that they had no children
give it to me that i may see if i can do it she had no sooner taken up the spindle than being hasty and careless she pierced her hand with the point of it and fainted away
at that moment the enchantment being ended the princess awoke and looking drowsily and tenderly at the young man said
but the faces of the men were rosy and the goblets by them had a few drops of wine left
be of good cheer king and queen your daughter shall not so die
the king came forward to receive her and showed his grief
all manner of answers were given to him
even the spits before the fire laden with partridges and pheasants went to sleep and the fire itself went to sleep also
have you come my prince
they passed into a hall of mirrors where they supped attended by the officers of the princess the violins and haut boys played old but excellent pieces of music and after supper to lose no time the grand almoner married the royal lovers in the chapel of the castle
he asked all the fairies in the landthere were seven all toldto stand godmothers to the little princess hoping that each might give her a gift and so she should have all imaginable perfections
it was the work of a moment
she touched the governesses maids of honour women of the bedchamber gentlemen officers stewards cooks scullions boys guards porters pages footmen she touched the horses in the stable with their grooms the great mastiffs in the court yard and even little pouste the tiny lap dog of the princess that was on the bed beside her
he had not a moments doubt that he was destined to this great adventure and full of ardour he determined at once to set out for the castle
the youngest for her gift decreed that she should be the most beautiful person in the world the next that she should have the mind of an angel the third that she should be perfectly graceful the fourth that she should dance admirably well the fifth that she should sing like a nightingale the sixth that she should play charmingly upon every musical instrument
he passed through one apartment after another where were ladies and gentlemen asleep in their chairs or standing
the lady in waiting became very impatient and at length announced to the princess that they all waited for her
the king and queen kissed their daughter farewell and left the castle issuing a proclamation that no person whatsoever was to approach it
a hundred years went by and the kingdom was in the hands of another royal family
i am spinning my fair child said the old woman who did not know her
her hand lay upon her breast and he touched his lips to it
he knew that she would not awake for a hundred years
before each was set a magnificent plate with a gold knife and a gold fork studded with diamonds and rubies
people came running in from all sides they threw water in the princesss face and did all they could to restore her but nothing would bring her to
but he managed to assure her of his love and they soon forgot all else as they talked and talked
the sleep will last a hundred years and at the end of that time a kings son will come to wake her
the princess will pierce her hand with a spindle but instead of dying she will only fall into a deep sleep
the prince was overjoyed at the words and at the tender voice and look and scarcely knew how to speak
the fairies now began to endow the princess
she touched with her wand everybody that was in the castle except the king and queen
what are you doing asked the princess
the good fairy who had saved her life and turned her death into sleep was in the kingdom of mataquin twelve thousand leagues away when this happened but she learned of it from a dwarf who had a pair of seven league boots and instantly set out for the castle where she arrived in an hour drawn by dragons in a fiery chariot
that was needless for in a quarter of an hour there had grown up about it a wood so thick and filled with thorns that nothing could get at the castle and the castle top itself could only be seen from a great distance
they marched down the long avenue and the wood opened again to let them pass
how pretty it is exclaimed the princess
so this is what she did
the men had plainly fallen asleep
he entered the guard room there the guards stood drawn up in line with carbines at their shoulders but they were sound asleep
the good fairy was very wise and saw that the princess when she woke would find herself all alone in that great castle and everything about her would be strange
the water said i and the forests sound are combating within me my new faith in something which i heard opposed to this
its tresses which so much the more dilate as higher they ascend had been by indians among their forests marvelled at for height
and saw their school diminished by the loss not only of elias but of moses and the apparel of their master changed
for such a prayer twas said unto me pray matilda that she tell thee and here answered as one does who doth free himself from blame
nor even thus our way continued far before the lady wholly turned herself unto me saying brother look and listen
and beatrice compassionate and sighing listened to them with such a countenance that scarce more changed was mary at the cross

i saw upon its right wing wheeled about the glorious host returning with the sun and with the sevenfold flames upon their faces
therefore my answer is with greater care that he may hear me who is weeping yonder so that the sin and dole be of one measure
but so much more malignant and more savage becomes the land untilled and with bad seed the more good earthly vigour it possesses
think reader if within myself i marvelled when i beheld the thing itself stand still and in its image it transformed itself
when from the flesh to spirit i ascended and beauty and virtue were in me increased i was to him less dear and less delightful
underneath which had she devoutly stayed i sooner should have tasted those delights ineffable and for a longer time
o thou who art beyond the sacred river turning to me the point of her discourse that edgewise even had seemed to me so keen
and lo a sudden lustre ran across on every side athwart the spacious forest such that it made me doubt if it were lightning
thus beatrice and i who at the feet of her commandments all devoted was my mind and eyes directed where she willed
as soon as on my vision smote the power sublime that had already pierced me through ere from my boyhood i had yet come forth
but when i had approached so near to them the common object which the sense deceives lost not by distance any of its marks
the callow birdlet waits for two or three but to the eyes of those already fledged in vain the net is spread or shaft is shot
and beatrice perhaps a greater care which oftentimes our memory takes away has made the vision of his mind obscure
then forth she drew me and all dripping brought into the dance of the four beautiful and each one with her arm did cover me
the ice that was about my heart congealed to air and water changed and in my anguish through mouth and eyes came gushing from my breast
even as in heaven star followeth after star there came close after them four animals incoronate each one with verdant leaf
but issues from a fountain safe and certain which by the will of god as much regains as it discharges open on two sides
plumed with six wings was every one of them the plumage full of eyes the eyes of argus if they were living would be such as these
up to my throat she in the stream had drawn me and dragging me behind her she was moving upon the water lightly as a shuttle
even as a cross bow breaks when tis discharged too tensely drawn the bowstring and the bow and with less force the arrow hits the mark
and now they seemed conducted by the white now by the red and from the song of her the others took their step or slow or swift
therefore i pass to what time i awoke and say a splendour rent from me the veil of slumber and a calling rise what dost thou
my faculties were in so great confusion that the voice moved but sooner was extinct than by its organs it was set at large
but read ezekiel who depicteth them as he beheld them from the region cold coming with cloud with whirlwind and with fire
the faculty that lends discourse to reason did apprehend that they were candlesticks and in the voices of the song hosanna

but us virgilius of himself deprived had left virgilius sweetest of all fathers virgilius to whom i for safety gave me
but because she her wanton roving eye turned upon me her angry paramour did scourge her from her head unto her feet
some time did i sustain him with my look revealing unto him my youthful eyes i led him with me turned in the right way
thou by so many circumstances only the justice of the interdict of god morally in the tree wouldst recognize
and if her speech were more diffuse i know not because already in my sight was she who from the hearing of aught else had shut me
while with amazement filled and jubilant my soul was tasting of the food that while it satisfies us makes us hunger for it
then when the heart restored my outward sense the lady i had found alone above me i saw and she was saying hold me hold me
alone she sat upon the very earth left there as guardian of the chariot which i had seen the biform monster fasten
cast down the seed of weeping and attend so shalt thou hear how in an opposite way my buried flesh should have directed thee
over her snow white veil with olive cinct appeared a lady under a green mantle vested in colour of the living flame
not only rome with no such splendid car eer gladdened africanus or augustus but poor to it that of the sun would be
as soon as i was with her as i should be she said to me why brother dost thou not venture to question now in coming with me
thou makest me remember where and what proserpina that moment was when lost her mother her and she herself the spring
but since the lightning ceases as it comes and that continuing brightened more and more within my thought i said what thing is this
in rear of all the group here treated of two old men i beheld unlike in habit but like in gait each dignified and grave
such had this man become in his new life potentially that every righteous habit would have made admirable proof in him
note thou and even as by me are uttered these words so teach them unto those who live that life which is a running unto death
they all were saying benedictus qui venis and scattering flowers above and round about manibus o date lilia plenis
and my own spirit that already now so long a time had been that in her presence trembling with awe it had not stood abashed
a softly breathing air that no mutation had in itself upon the forehead smote me no heavier blow than of a gentle wind
within which a five hundred ten and five one sent from god shall slay the thievish woman and that same giant who is sinning with her
thereafter four i saw of humble aspect and behind all an aged man alone walking in sleep with countenance acute

when forcibly my sight was turned away towards my left hand by those goddesses because i heard from them a too intently
it me befell that without perfect sound began i my necessity madonna you know and that which thereunto is good
as soon as she was where the grasses are bathed by the waters of the beauteous river to lift her eyes she granted me the boon
truly from this time forward shall my words be naked so far as it is befitting to lay them open unto thy rude gaze
with feet i stayed and with mine eyes i passed beyond the rivulet to look upon the great variety of the fresh may
then backward did i turn me wholly round unto my poets and saw that with a smile they had been listening to these closing words
already my slow steps had carried me into the ancient wood so far that i could not perceive where i had entered it
mine eyes fell downward into the clear fountain but seeing myself therein i sought the grass so great a shame did weigh my forehead down
and as my countenance was lifted up mine eye perceived those creatures beautiful had rested from the strewing of the flowers
weeping i said the things that present were with their false pleasure turned aside my steps soon as your countenance concealed itself
even as children silent in their shame stand listening with their eyes upon the ground and conscious of their fault and penitent
three maidens at the right wheel in a circle came onward dancing one so very red that in the fire she hardly had been noted
for this i visited the gates of death and unto him who so far up has led him my intercessions were with weeping borne
the good supreme sole in itself delighting created man good and this goodly place gave him as hansel of eternal peace
and into ways untrue he turned his steps pursuing the false images of good that never any promises fulfil
look at me well in sooth im beatrice how didst thou deign to come unto the mountain didst thou not know that man is happy here
and such as thou shalt find them in his pages such were they here saving that in their plumage john is with me and differeth from him

dante because virgilius has departed do not weep yet do not weep yet awhile for by another sword thou needst must weep
motionless halted the veracious people that came at first between it and the griffin turned themselves to the car as to their peace
and i beheld the flamelets onward go leaving behind themselves the air depicted and they of trailing pennons had the semblance
the interval between these four contained a chariot triumphal on two wheels which by a griffins neck came drawn along
so i gave way beneath that heavy burden outpouring in a torrent tears and sighs and the voice flagged upon its passage forth
may the desire come unto thee to draw near to this rivers bank i said to her so much that i might hear what thou art singing
then back i turned my face to those high things which moved themselves towards us so sedately they had been distanced by new wedded brides
even as the blessed at the final summons shall rise up quickened each one from his cavern uplifting light the reinvested flesh
i heard them murmur altogether adam then circled they about a tree despoiled of blooms and other leafage on each bough
so that it overhead remained distinct with sevenfold lists all of them of the colours whence the suns bow is made and delias girdle
and there appeared to me even as appears suddenly something that doth turn aside through very wonder every other thought
that soldiery of the celestial kingdom which marched in the advance had wholly passed us before the chariot had turned its pole
and i as by a signet is the wax which does not change the figure stamped upon it my brain is now imprinted by yourself
beneath her veil beyond the margent green she seemed to me far more her ancient self to excel than others here when she was here
less than of rose and more than violet a hue disclosing was renewed the tree that had erewhile its boughs so desolate
in grace do us the grace that thou unveil thy face to him so that he may discern the second beauty which thou dost conceal
to the left hand i turned with that reliance with which the little child runs to his mother when he has fear or when he is afflicted
then all the seven in front of her she placed and after her by beckoning only moved me and the lady and the sage who stayed
i do not think there shone so great a light under the lids of venus when transfixed by her own son beyond his usual custom
as soon as ever of my second age i was upon the threshold and changed life himself from me he took and gave to others
than i upraised at her command my chin and when she by the beard the face demanded well i perceived the venom of her meaning
erect upon the other bank she smiled bearing full many colours in her hands which that high land produces without seed
thus singing they began and afterwards unto the griffins breast they led me with them where beatrice was standing turned towards us
i saw the lady who erewhile appeared veiled underneath the angelic festival direct her eyes to me across the river
and when the car was opposite to me thunder was heard and all that folk august seemed to have further progress interdicted
but when i heard in their sweet melodies compassion for me more than had they said o wherefore lady dost thou thus upbraid him
in front of them the tigris and euphrates methought i saw forth issue from one fountain and slowly part like friends from one another
and as a wasp that draweth back its sting drawing unto himself his tail malign drew out the floor and went his way rejoicing
then to the wheels the maidens turned themselves and the griffin moved his burden benedight but so that not a feather of him fluttered
and turning to the pole which he had dragged he drew it close beneath the widowed bough and what was of it unto it left bound
reader to trace their forms no more i waste my rhymes for other spendings press me so that i in this cannot be prodigal

by his default short while he sojourned here by his default to weeping and to toil he changed his innocent laughter and sweet play
therefore for that worlds good which liveth ill fix on the car thine eyes and what thou seest having returned to earth take heed thou write
even as a painter who from model paints i would portray how i was lulled asleep he may who well can picture drowsihood
between her steps and mine were not a hundred when equally the margins gave a turn in such a way that to the east i faced
more hatred from leander did not suffer for rolling between sestos and abydos than that from me because it oped not then
the first were horned like oxen but the four had but a single horn upon the forehead a monster such had never yet been seen
the lady chid me why dost thou burn only so with affection for the living lights and dost not look at what comes after them
apart three paces did the river make us but hellespont where xerxes passed across a curb still to all human arrogance
confusion and dismay together mingled forced such a yes from out my mouth that sight was needful to the understanding of it
the lady fair who drew me through the ford followed with statius and myself the wheel which made its orbit with the lesser arc
i will too if not written at least painted thou bear it back within thee for the reason that cinct with palm the pilgrims staff is borne
whence her i answered i do not remember that ever i estranged myself from you nor have i conscience of it that reproves me
so high they rose that they were lost to sight his limbs were gold so far as he was bird and white the others with vermilion mingled
so i revived and saw that piteous one above me standing who had been conductress aforetime of my steps beside the river
and one of them as if by heaven commissioned singing veni sponsa de libano shouted three times and all the others after
now helicon must needs pour forth for me and with her choir urania must assist me to put in verse things difficult to think
after this fashion round the tree robust the others shouted and the twofold creature thus is preserved the seed of all the just
but with full ravishment the hours of prime singing received they in the midst of leaves that ever bore a burden to their rhymes
ye are new comers and because i smile began she peradventure in this place elect to human nature for its nest
short while shalt thou be here a forester and thou shalt be with me for evermore a citizen of that rome where christ is roman
yet not from their upright direction swayed so that the little birds upon their tops should leave the practice of each art of theirs
so pricked me then the thorn of penitence that of all other things the one which turned me most to its love became the most my foe
so she moved onward and i do not think that her tenth step was placed upon the ground when with her eyes upon mine eyes she smote
nor prayer for inspiration me availed by means of which in dreams and otherwise i called him back so little did he heed them
thereafter saw i leap into the body of the triumphal vehicle a fox that seemed unfed with any wholesome food
some apprehension keeps you marvelling but the psalm delectasti giveth light which has the power to uncloud your intellect
purgatorio canto twenty eight
it should not seem a marvel then on earth this being heard whenever any plant without seed manifest there taketh root
o virgins sacrosanct if ever hunger vigils or cold for you i have endured the occasion spurs me their reward to claim
but wherefore so beyond my power of sight soars your desirable discourse that aye the more i strive so much the more i lose it
even so when she had taken hold of me the beautiful lady moved and unto statius said in her womanly manner come with him
then by the way that it before had come into the chariots chest i saw the eagle descend and leave it feathered with his plumes
the beautiful lady opened wide her arms embraced my head and plunged me underneath where i was forced to swallow of the water
but said morrel the culpritthe murdererthe assassin
but he stopped on the landing he had not the courage to again visit the death chamber
but in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight
villefort rose half ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of grief
sir cried morrel seizing the moist hand of the paralytic they ask me who i am and what right i have to be here
the procureur
yes
no
villefort met them at the door of his study having in a few words thanked the district doctor he turned to davrigny and saidand now the priest
see my father see
he therefore approached the bed and while his companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in chloride of lime he uncovered the calm and pale face which looked like that of a sleeping angel
no said villefort fetch the nearest
yes indicated the old man
yes
gentlemen he said in a hoarse voice give me your word of honor that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves the two men drew back
gentlemen said morrel reading all that passed through the minds of the witnesses to the scene i know what i am saying and you know as well as i do what i am about to sayvalentine has been assassinated villefort hung his head davrigny approached nearer and noirtier said yes with his eyes
the district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just unclosed the lips
the terrible office he had held for twenty five years had succeeded in making him more or less than man
villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man who almost a stranger to him called noirtier his father
yes yes continued morrel recall the scene for the words you thought were only given to silence and solitude fell into my ears
oh said villefort inexpressibly delighted to think that the inquiries were to be made by him aloneoh be satisfied i can understand my father davrigny took the young mans arm and led him out of the room
at the end of a quarter of an hour a faltering footstep was heard and villefort appeared at the door of the apartment where davrigny and morrel had been staying one absorbed in meditation the other in grief
i know it sir the servants who fled from the house informed me
yes
for some temperaments work is a remedy for all afflictions
the doctor of the dead then laid his permit on the corner of the table and having fulfilled his duty was conducted out by davrigny
but can he understand you
no
valentine now requires only the ministrations of the priest
thank you sir said davrigny since you have commenced your sacred office deign to continue it
do you wish to see him
take a last farewell sir of her sad remains take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own and then separate yourself from her forever
i am stricken by fate
i am going sir and i do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than mine davrigny took the priests hand and without meeting villefort who was engaged in his study they reached valentines room which on the following night was to be occupied by the undertakers
i only wish to be alone
it was something terrible to witness the silent agony the mute despair of noirtier whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks
i tell you that the dose has been double the poison changed and that this time it has succeeded
the doctor
as the doctors entered the street they saw a man in a cassock standing on the threshold of the next door
my father has revealed the culprits name my father thirsts for revenge as much as you do yet even he conjures you as i do to keep this secret
davrigny accosted the priest
who are you sir he asked that forget that this is not the manner to enter a house stricken with death go sir go but morrel remained motionless he could not detach his eyes from that disordered bed and the pale corpse of the young girl who was lying on it
sir said villefort striving to struggle against this triple force and his own emotionsir you are deceived no one commits crimes here
one could have thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding death
the two doctors therefore entered the room alone
i tell you sir that two persons exist in you the father has mourned sufficiently now let the procureur fulfil his office
noirtier was near the bed pale motionless and silent as the corpse
alas said davrigny she is indeed dead poor child
but you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left this earthshe has nothing more to do with the adoration of men
oh you rave sir exclaimed villefort in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was taken
and the cry issued from his pores if we may thus speaka cry frightful in its silence davrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful restorative
and i say that murders are committed here said morrel whose voice though lower in tone lost none of its terrible distinctness i tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four months
is there any particular priest you wish to pray with valentine asked davrigny
it is a young girl
godo you hear said villefort while davrigny advanced to lead morrel out
villefort continued he knows me and i have pledged my word to him
we have before stated that all the servants had fled
is it not so father
morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him
yes replied noirtier
maximilian
tell themoh tell them that corpse belongs to me
noirtier wishes to speak
yes replied noirtier with an expression of sinister joy
his glance at first wandering fixed itself upon morrel
you will excuse me will you not
i was about to offer myself sir said the priest it is our mission to forestall our duties
at length happier than the young man who sobbed without weeping tears glistened in the eyes of noirtier
do you wish me to leave said morrel sadly
and will you direct us exclaimed the young man
see what they have done cried morrel with one hand leaning on the back of the chair and the other extended towards valentine
do you not father
ah said the priest in a marked italian accent yes i have heard that death is in that house
you can come he said and led them back to noirtier morrel looked attentively on villefort
mr procureur said morrel with increasing vehemence no mercy is allowed i denounce the crime it is your place to seek the assassin the young mans implacable eyes interrogated villefort who on his side glanced from noirtier to davrigny
yes replied noirtier
the eyes of noirtier glistened and davrigny approached
alas alas sir have pity on me
do not alarm yourself sir justice will be done said villefort
sir he said are you disposed to confer a great obligation on an unhappy father who has just lost his daughter

the three friends were astounded
i declared myself quite willing for it was necessary to brazen it out after having ventured as far as i had done
i confess candidly that i deceived them as the papa deldimopulo used to deceive the greeks who applied to him for the oracles of the virgin
in every one of the seventy two parishes of the city of venice there is a large public house called magazzino
we would very often spend the whole night rambling about the city inventing and carrying into execution the most impertinent practical jokes
i played the violin in one of the numerous bands engaged for the balls which were given for three consecutive days in the soranzo palace
the young womans husband was a weaver by trade and so were his two friends
our chief a noble venetian belonging to the balbi family said to us it would be a good joke to carry off those three blockheads and to keep the pretty woman in our possession he immediately explained his plan and under cover of our masks we entered their room balbi at the head of us
whenever we could contrive to get into a church tower we thought it great fun to frighten all the parish by ringing the alarm bell as if some fire had broken out but that was not all we always cut the bell ropes so that in the morning the churchwardens had no means of summoning the faithful to early mass
i rubbed it with all my strength but he told me in a sort of indistinct whisper that the numbness was spreading all along the left side and that he was dying
an invincible self love would have prevented me from declaring myself unworthy of their friendship either by my ignorance or by my pride and i should have been guilty of great rudeness if i had ceased to visit them
we took our three prisoners to a large boat
by scraping my violin i earned enough to keep myself without requiring anybodys assistance and i have always thought that the man who can support himself is happy
it was during the carnival of seventeen forty five after midnight we were all the eight of us rambling about together with our masks on in quest of some new sort of mischief to amuse us and we went into the magazzino of the parish of the holy cross to get something to drink
we intend only to take some refreshment at the rialto and then we will take you home in safety
i jumped out of the gondola and found myself on the very spot where three years before i had taught razetta such a forcible lesson i enquired for a surgeon at the first coffee house and ran to the house that was pointed out to me
i accepted gratefully and sat down near him
i threw myself at his feet to assure him of my gratitude and embraced him calling him my father
but what i could not and probably never shall understand was the reason for which the fathers who were not so simple or so ignorant as our evangelists did not feel able to deny the divinity of oracles and in order to get out of the difficulty ascribed them to the devil
our chief as a matter of right claims the privilege of opening the ball and by dint of sweet words he overcomes the very natural repugnance she feels at consummating the sacrifice in so numerous company
whoever you may be i am indebted to you for my life
not one of us knew where balbi wanted to take the three poor devils
the offer of that reward would have made us tremble if our leader precisely the one who alone had no interest in turning informer had not been a patrician
the complaint was candidly written and contained nothing but the truth but the criminal portion of the truth was veiled by a circumstance which must have brought a smile on the grave countenances of the judges and highly amused the public at large the complaint setting forth that the eight masked men had not rendered themselves guilty of any act disagreeable to the wife
the nobility the merchants even workmen in good circumstances are never seen in the magazzino for cleanliness is not exactly worshipped in such places
never fear you shall see him again to morrow
i kept silent looking very modest but hardly able to control my mirth whilst the doctor was staring at me with a mixture of astonishment and of spite evidently thinking me some bold quack who had tried to supplant him
they were in despair they had enquired about the accident from the gondoliers and having been told that i knew more than they did they loaded me with questions which i answered
you need not think of the future think only of enjoying yourself and take me as your adviser in everything that may happen to you in everything you may wish to undertake and you may be certain of always finding me your friend
with an education which ought to have ensured me an honourable standing in the world with some intelligence wit good literary and scientific knowledge and endowed with those accidental physical qualities which are such a good passport into society i found myself at the age of twenty the mean follower of a sublime art in which if great talent is rightly admired mediocrity is as rightly despised
this sententious answer struck them with astonishment as i expected it would and they looked at each other in great surprise
we soon manage to reconcile her to her fate by the gallantry of our proceedings encouraged by a good supper and by the stimulus of wine prepared by our compliments and by a few kisses she realizes what is in store for her and does not seem to have any unconquerable objection
he wrote the question and gave it to me i read it i could not understand either the subject or the meaning of the words but it did not matter i had to give an answer
the hermit remarked the senator has without informing you of it linked an invisible spirit to the calculus he has taught you for simple numbers can not have the power of reason
when the play was over i went with them to the drinking booth which we often left intoxicated to spend the night in houses of ill fame
two days afterwards our nocturnal orgy began to be talked of
yet there are a few private rooms which contain a table surrounded with benches in which a respectable family or a few friends can enjoy themselves in a decent way
we take off our masks and the sight of eight young healthy faces seems to please the beauty we had so unceremoniously carried off
he entreated me to tell him the truth
i might be told that if i had wished to follow the rules of pure morality i ought either to have declined intimate intercourse with them or to have undeceived them
i was compelled by poverty to become a member of a musical band in which i could expect neither esteem nor consideration and i was well aware that i should be the laughing stock of the persons who had known me as a doctor in divinity as an ecclesiastic and as an officer in the army and had welcomed me in the highest society
it would be hard to say who was the more astonished the doctor when he saw an unknown young man whom he must have taken for an impostor declared more learned than himself or i when i saw myself transformed into a physician at a moments notice
your first protectors wanted to make you a priest a doctor an advocate a soldier and ended by making a fiddler of you those persons did not know you
the city was alive with complaints and we laughed at the useless search made by the police to find out those who disturbed the peace of the inhabitants
we did the same with physicians whom we often sent half dressed to some nobleman who was enjoying excellent health
i turn out a worthless fellowmy good fortunei become a rich nobleman
their infatuation encouraging me i spoke like a learned physician i dogmatized i quoted authors whom i had never read
i was greatly frightened i opened the curtain took the lantern and found him almost insensible and the mouth drawn on one side
after they had assured themselves of the reality of my cabalistic science by questions respecting the past they decided to turn it to some use by consulting it upon the present and upon the future
with all these oddities the three friends were truly intelligent and even witty and at the beginning of my acquaintance with them i could not reconcile these antagonistic points
after this the boatman is ordered to take us to saint genevieve where we land after paying for the boat
it is the sum i used to receive from my father when i was your age
an hour later two noblemen friends of the senator came in one a few minutes after the other
i knocked as hard as i could the door was at last opened and i made the surgeon follow me in his dressing gown as far as the gondola which was waiting he bled the senator while i was tearing my shirt to make the compress and the bandage
but although believing fully in my oracles they were too kind hearted to think them the work of the devil and it suited their natural goodness better to believe my answers inspired by some heavenly spirit
he received it with many thanks and enquired where i lived
people can likewise eat in the magazzino but they must obtain what they want from the pork butcher near by who has the exclusive sale of eatables and likewise keeps his shop open throughout the night
i certainly did not act towards them with a true sense of honesty but if the reader to whom i confess myself is acquainted with the world and with the spirit of society i entreat him to think before judging me and perhaps i may meet with some indulgence at his hands
he was celebrated in venice not only for his eloquence and his great talents as a statesman but also for the gallantries of his youth
three or four months afterwards the chevalier nicolas iron then one of the inquisitors astonished me greatly by telling me the whole story giving the names of all the actors
you possess a real treasure and you may derive great advantages from it
i examined him closely and found him hardly able to breathe
i grant that my profession was not a brilliant one but i did not mind it and calling prejudices all the feelings which rose in my breast against myself i was not long in sharing all the habits of my degraded comrades
there was no cowardly traitor amongst us although we were all poor but fear had its effect and our nocturnal pranks were not renewed
my brother francois alone exempted himself from paying the tribute saying that he was ill the only excuse which could render his refusal valid for we had established as a law that every member of our society was bound to do whatever was done by the others
they were not only good christians and faithful to the church but even real devotees and full of scruples
how so
he had been very extravagant with women and more than one of them had committed many follies for him
he sails all along the canal gets out of it takes several turnings and in a quarter of an hour we reach saint george where balbi lands our prisoners who are delighted to find themselves at liberty
i know you and appreciate you
i understood that he was seized with an apoplectic stroke and called out to the gondoliers to land me at once in order to procure a surgeon to bleed the patient
where is my husband
in the evening one of the two friends told me that if i had any business to attend to i could go because they would both pass the night on a mattress near the patient
the rank of balbi quieted my anxiety at once because i knew that even supposing one of us were vile enough to betray our secret for the sake of the reward the tribunal would have done nothing in order not to implicate a patrician
all visitors were sent away by my advice and the two noblemen and myself were the only persons in the sick mans room
the incarnation of the word they would say was a trifle for god and therefore easy to understand and the resurrection was so comprehensible that it did not appear to them wonderful because as god cannot die jesus christ was naturally certain to rise again
unwilling to hurt his vanity by telling him that he was mistaken i took the wild resolution of informing him in the presence of his two friends that i possessed a certain numeral calculus which gave answers also in numbers to any questions i liked to put
they did not know who i was and did not like to ask me whilst i thought it better to preserve a modest silence
in taking his handkerchief out of his pocket he let a letter drop on the ground
god had evidently instructed your guardian angel to bring you to me
the waiter of the magazzino came to be paid and our chief gave him what was due enjoining silence under penalty of death
the three plaintiffs had not been able to leave the island of saint george until day break and the husband on reaching his house had found his wife quietly asleep in her bed
they were not married and after having renounced all commerce with women they had become the enemies of the female sex perhaps a strong proof of the weakness of their minds
if the question was so obscure that i could not make out the sense of it it was natural that i should not understand the answer
through the friendship of those three men i was certain of obtaining consideration and influence in my own country
your apartment is ready you may send your clothes you shall have a servant a gondola at your orders my own table and ten sequins a month
doctor the person who has delivered me from your mercury which was killing me is a more skilful physician than you and saying these words he pointed to me
he did not tell me whether any one of the band had betrayed the secret and i did not care to know but i could clearly see the characteristic spirit of the aristocracy for which the solo mihi is the supreme law
we took good care to be careful for if we had been discovered we stood a very fair chance of being sent to practice rowing at the expense of the council of ten
what extraordinary things will sometimes occur from mere chance or from the force of circumstances
i must confess that i was very glad of it and i told my patient that a proper diet was all he needed and that nature assisted by the approaching fine season would do the rest
they joined together to address a complaint to the council of ten
but a prejudiced mind cannot reason well and the faculty of reasoning is the most important of all i often laughed when i heard them talk on religious matters they would ridicule those whose intellectual faculties were so limited that they could not understand the mysteries of religion
my readers may imagine whether we felt inclined to laugh when the charming creature bade us good night thanking us all with perfect good faith
as for the eucharist transubstantiation the real presence it was all no mystery to them but palpable evidence and yet they were not jesuits
a few minutes afterwards he asked me to rub his left arm which he said was so benumbed that he could not feel it
he had gambled and lost a great deal and his brother was his most bitter enemy because he was infatuated with the idea that he had tried to poison him
do not weep my beauty says balbi to her we will not hurt you
taking everything upon myself i ordered a servant to hurry out for a physician who came in a short time and ordered the patient to be bled again thus approving the first bleeding prescribed by me
on the third day towards the end of the dancing an hour before day break feeling tired i left the orchestra abruptly and as i was going down the stairs i observed a senator wearing his red robes on the point of getting into a gondola
the said lady having been handsomely entertained by the eight masked men had been escorted to her house where she had been politely requested to excuse the joke perpetrated upon her husband
i felt that in my first profession as i was not blessed with the vocation necessary to it i should have succeeded only by dint of hypocrisy and i should have been despicable in my own estimation even if i had seen the purple mantle on my shoulders for the greatest dignities cannot silence a mans own conscience
our scandalous proceedings often exposed us to the greatest danger
there is also another consideration dear reader and as i love you i will tell you what it is
she doubtless thinks the offering agreeable for when i present myself as the priest appointed to sacrifice a second time to the god of love she receives me almost with gratitude and she cannot conceal her joy when she finds out that she is destined to make us all happy
i saw how easy it must have been for the ancient heathen priests to impose upon ignorant and therefore credulous mankind
i told him and he insisted upon my coming with him in the gondola saying that he would leave me at my house
and i sir i said will remain near his bed in this arm chair for if i went away the patient would die and he will live as long as i am near him
not exactly returned kaliko
in the metal forest
king kaliko
oh no im quite sure he didnt
so i think i will assemble the chief nomes of my kingdom in this throne room and tell them that i am their new king then i can ask them to assist us in searching for the secret passages
dont worry replied quox
i hope he doesnt work too hard said shaggy
the ugly one
he doesnt work at all
do you suppose ruggedo destroyed them
me stammered the chamberlain greatly surprised by the question well i couldnt be a worse king im sure
however said shaggy they are gone that is certain so we cannot help them or be helped by them
all the trees are gold and silver and the ground is strewn with precious stones so it is a sort of treasury
kaliko hesitated
quox did not have much to say until the conversation was ended but then he turned to kaliko and asked
but is my dear brother well he added anxiously
next instant shaggy was himself again and quox said to him grumblingly
thats funny remarked betsy thoughtfully
please get off my left toe shaggy man and be more particular where you step
they fell into the big pit in the passage and we put the cover on to keep them there but when the executioners went to look for them they had all disappeared from the pit and we could find no trace of them
of course not said he jumping up from the throne where he had seated himself
betsy laughed and shaggy seemed rather hurt but polychrome relieved his embarrassment by saying softly one can be ugly in looks but lovely in disposition
hooray cried betsy im glad of that
they agreed that it did but no one could explain the mystery
but to disappear like that seems like magic now doesnt it
where is that
very willingly replied kaliko
true agreed kaliko
of course said kaliko
portrait painting is a bad pursuit for an emotional artist as it destroys his personality and his sympathy however even for the emotional artist there is hope as a portrait can be converted into a picture by adding to the likeness of the sitter some dramatic interest or some picturesque adjunct
as for etchings they are of two kindsbritish and foreign
it is really impossible not to be touched by so charming a description
we fully admit that it is extremely amusing and no doubt mr quilter is quite earnest in his endeavours to elevate art to the dignity of manual labour but the extraordinary vulgarity of the style alone will always be sufficient to prevent these sententiae artis from being anything more than curiosities of literature mr quilter has missed his chance for he has failed even to make himself the tupper of painting
that there is a difference between colour and colours that an artist be he portrait painter or dramatist always reveals himself in his manner are ideas that can hardly be said to occur to him but mr quilter really does his best and bravely faces every difficulty in modern art with the exception of mr whistler
and then the picture he draws of the ideal home where everything though ugly is hallowed by domestic memories and where beauty appeals not to the heartless eye but the family affections babys chair there and the mothers work basket near the fire and the ornaments fred brought home from india on the mantel board
a jolly art critic
painting he tells us is of a different quality to mathematics and finish in art is adding more fact
mr quilter is entirely free from affectation of any kind
sculpture he regards as paintings poor relation so with the exception of a jaunty allusion to the rough modelling of tanagra figurines he hardly refers at all to the plastic arts but on painters he writes with much vigour and joviality
to many no doubt he will seem to be somewhat blatant and bumptious but we prefer to regard him as being simply british
far from it
on the whole the book will not do
after listening so long to the don quixote of art to listen once to sancho panza is both salutary and refreshing
sententiae artis first principles of art for painters and picture lovers
by harry quilter m a isbister
he rollicks through art with the recklessness of the tourist and describes its beauties with the enthusiasm of the auctioneer
there is a healthy bank holiday atmosphere about this book which is extremely pleasant
about artists and their work mr quilter has of course a great deal to say
he was unhappily conscious of his total exhaustion
he could feel with acute sensitivity hear and see clearly when he opened his eyes
dont talk like an idiot
a red haired mountain of a man with an apparently inexhaustible store of energy
one minute a voice said and the time buzzer sounded
but as soon as the scores began to mount and eliminations cut into their ranks there was complete silence after dark
the slap of the button on flesh and the arc of steel that reached out and ended on irolgs chest over his heart
the other voice snapped with a harsh urgency clearly used to command
that was really all that counted now
all you need is a touch to win
stephen crane
at last
he reactedbut his blade just met air
thats all he needs too brion grunted opening his eyes to look at the wiry length of the man at the other end of the long mat
youre being a fool
for my mother and father
this is physically impossible when conscious
whoever said you could was making a big mistake and there is going to be trouble
how do we stand he asked the handler who was kneading his aching muscles
this was allowed
no not walking falling
out was the single snarled word of the response
only his heart and lungs worked on at a strong measured rate
then the powerful twist that thrust it aside
working with this as a clue brion had developed a self hypnotic technique that allowed him to tap this reservoir of unknown strengththe source of second wind the survival strength that made the difference between life and death
his eyes closed and he was only distantly aware of his handlers catching him as he fell carrying him to his bench while they massaged his limp body and cleansed the wound all of his attention was turned inward
the force of his rush was so great that the guards on their weapons locked and their bodies crashed together
berserkers and juramentados continue to fight and kill though carved by scores of mortal wounds
just thrust and parry and victory to the stronger
there was silence then and still wondering brion was once more asleep
ten seconds
particularly so on this last night when only two of the little cubicles were occupied the thousands of others standing with dark empty doors
of course not
when the buzzer sounded he pulled his foil from his seconds startled grasp and ran forward
he had a standing order with off planet agents for archaic chess books the older the better
he didnt attempt to attack just let brion wear himself out against the firm shield of his defense
the contestants in the twenties needed undisturbed rest therefore nights in the dormitories were as quiet as death
and when he attacked it was always there to beat him aside
the month of continuous mental and physical combat had taken its toll
it would be hard to stay on his feet much less summon the strength and skill to fight and win a touch
if anything he was pressing the attack
four four
except that something was wrong and it was like walking through warm glue
the nagging memory of the previous night loomed up then and he turned it over and over in his mind examining it from all sides
walking on his knees
thrustthrustand each time the parrying sword a little slower to return
someone spoke his name
brion saw something close to panic on his opponents face when the man finally recognized his error
death seemed an inescapable part of this kind of strength but there was another type that could easily be brought about in any deep trancehypnotic rigidity
he must have drawn his gun because the intruder said quickly put that away
with each passing second the power drew at the basic reserves of life draining it from his body
now stand aside
self hypnosis was an accepted tool
the buzzers whirr triggered his muscles into complete relaxation
the words were whispered but cleartwo voices just outside the thin metal of his door
brion had carefully conditioned the reflex in himself
brion wasnt tiring
in and under the guard
common as the phenomenon seemed to be in the textbooks it proved impossible to duplicate
others had died before during the twenties and death during the last round was in some ways easier than defeat
every man who entered the twenties had his own training tricks brion had a few individual ones that had helped him so far
im not to go in there says the ex bank clerk drawing back in dismay from the cloud of foul faces which lowered upon him
hold on to me miss nancy said the giant im big enough to carry double
kirkland only breathed harder and looked round for mr north but mr north had gone
fretted hisself to sleep yer reverence said hailes in accents of parental concern
oh mr north
if he was dying i cant
his flogging wouldnt have killed a flea
mr north cried a voice for the love of god let me out of this place
chapter thirteen
mr north
i wont have my men knocked up with flogging these rascals
he had hardly uttered the words when the boy flung himself beneath the log
the commandant roused from slumber told mr north that kirkland might stop where he was and that hed thank the chaplain not to wake him up in the middle of the night because a blank prisoner set up a blank howling
oh he said that such a wretch as i should live
its no good being in the mopes you know
now then miss nancy said one of the men whats the matter with you kirkland shuddered and his pale face grew crimson
do him good curse him
a prisoner refractory your reverence said the watchman
oh for gods sake mr north
your blessed hidell feel for this see if it dont
ill blank soon cure you of that and forthwith ordered him to the chain gang for insubordination
what have you been doing to get into this scrape
youll see if you wont remember this day
but kirkland kept steadily on for the river
but kirkland could do nothing but cryoh mr north
get in so kirkland aged twenty two and the son of methodist parents went in
would you see me perish body and soul in this place
whats the matter here he asked
north rushed away to the commandant and the instant his back was turned hailes the watchman flung open the door and darted into the dormitory
just as he reached it however the figure of mr north rose from behind a pile of stones
mr north im sorry you should have had the trouble to come here but will you let me go to sleep
but mr troke
if you fall we must fall over you and then youre done for
so doubtless it was and might have been had not an untoward accident occurred
north returned to the prison disconsolately found the dutiful hailes at his post and all quiet
trokepick out some likely man will you
about dawn the next morning mr northwho amongst other vagaries not approved of by his bishop had a habit of prowling about the prison at unofficial hourswas attracted by a dispute at the door of the dormitory
let him out watchman said north
good evening sir
i order you sir north cried indignant
wants to come out
mr north
rufus dawes among whose sinister memories this yard was numbered sighed
poor young chap
kirkland belonged to a methodist family and owned a piety utterly out of place in that region
very sorry your reverence but your reverence knows that i darent do such a thing mr
yes sir said troke
kirkland jumped for the jetty missed his footing and fell into the arms of the chaplain
what do they do if you try to bolt whispered kirkland
ill be down in the morning myself if i can
kirkland ghastly pale bleeding with his woollen shirt torn and his blue eyes wide open with terror was clinging to the bars
you young verminyou shall pay for this cries troke
what kirkland cried north who was ignorant of the vengeance of the commandant
impertinent young beggar said burgess
north screamed kirkland
whats become of kirkland he asked
his name was kirkland and he belonged to what were known as the educated prisoners
his face was of a greenish tint and wore an expression of bewildered horror
kill you returned dawes in a tone of surprise at so preposterous a question
if the scourger wont do his duty tie him up and give him five and twenty for himself
you can guess what that unhappy boy has suffered
they wont do it
silence cried troke
kirkland was put into a separate cell that night and troke by way of assuring him a good nights rest told him that he was to have fifty in the morning
hold up my lad
cant sir without an order from the commandant
must stop that
oh mr north
i cant
cheer up man said dawes touched with momentary pity
oh you ministers of christwolves in sheeps clothingyou shall be judged for this
for gods sake mr north and beat on the bars with white and sweating hands
troke reported the ex bank clerk that night to burgess and burgess who was about to go to dinner with the new chaplain disposed of his case out of hand
theres more trouble with you bloody aristocrats than enough
oh mr north says kirkland why did you stop me
the toil was severe and the companionship uncouth but despite his blistered hands and aching back he had not experienced anything so very terrible after all
halt you young fool roared troke raising his carbine
but my good sir protested north restraining his impulse to overstep the bounds of modesty in his language to his superior officer you know the character of the men in that ward
what does he care
the work of the gang that afternoon was the carrying of some heavy logs to the water side and rufus dawes observed that kirkland was exhausted long before the task was accomplished
have you ever been in thatthat place i was in last night asked kirkland
thank god said kirkland
stow your gaff says troke with another oath and impatiently striking the lad with his thongi cant argue here all night
i suppose so
tell macklewain to be readyor stay ill tell him myselfill break the young devils spirit blank him
fifty lashes troke
that last fellow you had ought to have been tied up himself
tried to bolt eh
march
you blank blank is that your blank game
let him out cried north again stamping his foot
rufus dawes nodded
so fierce was the glamour of the place however that when locked into his cell he felt ashamed for that sigh and strove to erase the memory of it
lie quiet
in the morning rufus dawes coming to his place on the chain gang was struck by the altered appearance of kirkland
he had been a clerk in a banking house and was transported for embezzlement though by some grave doubts as to his guilt were entertained
this of course was mere bravado on the part of the commandant
then he began to walk up and down to fling himself on the sofa to read to pray
whom is he going to flog now
hullo north whats the matter
you have not been long in the colony mr meekin
that at all times debasing at this particular time it was infamous that a vice unworthy of any man was doubly sinful in a man of education and a minister of god
no no it will pass
he saw in the darkness the brandy bottlevulgar and terrible apparition
he saved her life you know
the dinner went off successfully
abandoned indeed by god and manalmost
i hope he is said north
fifty lashes
if you please said meekin gravely
everything must give way to that
good night once more
he went into his bedroom and flung himself on the bed but only to toss from side to side
he has the strangest fits at times
do you know captain frere
sleep would not come to him
he mixed a teaspoonful of this in a pannikin of water and drank it
ill report this to the government said north aghast
look here mr north i dont interfere with what you do to the prisoners souls dont you interfere with what i do to their bodies
i have a headache his manner of speech and action was so awkward that a silence fell upon the party caused by each one wondering why mr north should grow confused and drum his fingers on the table and stare everywhere but at the decanter
you dont mean to say hes going to flog kirkland
he seems to me to be truly penitent for his offencesa misguided but not a hypocritical man if my knowledge of human nature goes for anything
burgessdesirous perhaps of favourably impressing the chaplain whom the bishop delighted to honourshut off his blasphemy for a while and was urbane enough
so captain frere thinks
this is murderous
how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon that bank
we cant do anything without evidence
it relieved him for a while
mr meekindr
so they went on to the verandah and looked down upon the lights of the prison and listened to the sea lapping the shore
the government may go to and you too roared burgess
i shall find my portmanteau in my room you said
besides hes not the sort of creature to complain
sometimes a party comes over with a recommendation from the governor and i show them over the place but as a rule we see no one but ourselves
there lurked something that fascinated him
a romantic story captain burgess
unless its a cancer in the stomach i dont know what it can be
ha said north looking wildly round upon them
youll find us rough mr meekin he said but youll find us all there when were wanted this is a little kingdom in itself
here attention was called by the strange behaviour of mr north
well hell be put into the hospital for a week or so to morrow said macklewain and thatll give him a spell
it has made me heartsick
in the midst of his arguments he found himself at the cupboard with the bottle at his lips in an attitude that was at once ludicrous and horrible
north knew well that he would never dare to attempt any such act of violence but the insult stung him like the cut of a whip
a great rascal put in north
the two men looked at each other and presently burgesss eyes fell before those of the chaplain
not at this moment sir said burgess with dignity
to see him rolling on the sofa in agony to see his white face his parched lips and his contracted brow to hear his moans and muttered prayers one would have thought him suffering from the pangs of some terrible disease
i must keep my wits for to morrow
the taste of the liquor maddened him for more
thats macklewains business
macklewain shook his head seriously
i wouldnt trust him
meekin too will suspect
i have seen him and his condition of mind is pitiable
he had no cancer
i should say so returned burgess with a laugh modelled upon maurice freres own
captain burgess macklewain tells me you are going to flog kirkland
he attempted suicide to dayunhappy creature
good night
complain
very few
he raised it to his lips and eagerly drank
he opened the book again and forced himself to read but his eyes wandered to the cupboard
captain frere takes a deep interest in all relating to convict discipline went on meekin unheeding the interruption and is anxious that mrs frere should see this place
youre a dismissed officer of the government sir
you wont have a nip of brandy before you start asked burgess
help me
thank you none said north filling a tumbler with water
yes it is very complete he said almost too complete
chapter fourteen
oh this must be stopped cried north in great alarm
the lad has been cruelly punished already
then captain burgess cried north his pale face flushing i tell you the boys blood will be on your head
the reverend meekin was not accustomed to clergymen who wore black neckties smoked clay pipes chewed tobacco and drank neat brandy out of tumblers
there were a few matters i noticed in hobart town that did not quite please methe frequent use of profane language for instancebut on the whole i was delighted with the scheme
frere
that young butler fellow of his what kirkland cried north
mr norths disposition
in vain he repeated texts of scripture and scraps of verse in vain counted imaginary sheep or listened to imaginary clock tickings
well now said meekin with asperity i dont agree with you everybody seems to be against that poor fellowcaptain frere tried to make me think that his letters contained a hidden meaning but i dont believe they did
damn your impertinence sir burst out burgess
he cant stand it
i struggle but i am weak
meekinever softly at his easewas the first to speak
perhaps youll have the goodness to allow me to be the best judge of that returned macklewain drawing up his little body to its least insignificant stature
captain burgess you have no right to mock at my office
a nice example to set
he was put into the long dormitory said north you know what sort of a place that is
north returned home in great agitation
hes too weak
the boys made his bed and he must lie on it
well hows forrest cried burgess
thats better
i suppose severity is necessary returned meekin though to my ears a flogging sounds a little distasteful
ill teach my prisoners to attempt suicide
do you persist in having this boy flogged
macklewain have a glass of wine but macklewain was tired and wanted to get home
i thought it was a little paradise said meekin
or like sancho panzas island said north
it is so complete
i am a minister of god sir and i forbid you to commit this crime
no
the reverend meekin eyed his clerical brother with horror
it was as though he had reached the crisis of a disease which had been for days gathering force i must have a teaspoonful he said to allay the craving
and let us hope poor mr north will succeed in his labour of love said meekin shutting the little gate and save the unfortunate kirkland
yes yes
they shall not flog that boy he said
it is a brutal punishment
pray dont hurry said meekin politely
i hope you will be comfortable
if the boy has anything to complain of why dont he complain
miss vickers a charming young person
weve got the fellows here you know
the condition of those dormitories is infamous
cancer in the stomach
good night sir
well sir what of that said burgess
my dear sir replied north alive to the importance of conciliating the surgeon you havent seen him lately
still he could not sleep
captain burgess was shutting his verandah window when north hurried up
i doubtforgive me for expressing myself so freelyif you quite know of our convict system
i must also be thinking of repose said meekin the journeythough most enjoyablehas fatigued me
then dont you interfere with me sir
i saw them tried at hobart town said meekin
mr meekin heres the gate and your room is on the right hand
mr north sighed again
ill be back shortly
mr meekin expressed some alarm but dr macklewain re assured him that sort of nonsense must be stopped said he
an admirable one
twice he paused on the way to the sitting room and twice was he driven on by a power stronger than his will
he saw its amber fluid sparkle he heard it gurgle as he poured it out
he got up at length went into the kitchen and found a packet of red pepper
they are going to sydney where captain frere has some interest and frere thinks of taking port arthur on his way down
he made a stride towards the commandant as though to seize him by the throat but checking himself in time stood still with clenched hands flashing eyes and beard that bristled
its a punishment for brutes said burgess and laughed pleased with the nearest approach to an epigram he ever made in his life
pray help yourself to wine
he reached it at length and opening the cupboard pulled out what he sought
i was quartered with him at sarah island
captain burgess protested north i assure you that he does not deserve punishment
fool that i am
well thats just what im flogging him for
i heard something about it too
the reverend mr north in this cool atmosphere seemed to recover himself and conversation progressed with some sprightliness
there is something wrong about him but i cant make out what it is
no i say
good night
his staff you know mr north
ill go back and see burgess said north
confound itanother of my best men grumbled burgess
how delightful the grass smells
burgess white with rage rang the bell that summoned his convict servant
he tried to drown himself this morning
north pursed up his lips
oh theres no fear of him said burgess cheerily if he grows uproarious well soon give him a touch of the cat
if burgess flogs him ill report it to the governor cries north in great heat
a spasm
nothing said north recovering himself with an effort
he wept he prayed he fought with his desire as with a madness
captain frere says that the scenery is delightful so it is returned north looking askance but the prisoners are not delightful
oh god give me strength
he is just married you know
the devil he is
up at daylight i suppose again
hed rather kill himself
this seems a very pleasant place and i think i shall enjoy myself very much
macklewain i want to speak with you a moment
dear me how dreadful says meekin
ill report this to the government
ah doctor we all have our crosses have we not
i cant help it
i wonder burgess didnt give him a hundred
their vanguard confined with difficulty for three centuries beyond the eastern alps at the expense of sanguinary wars had been adopted wherever it was practicable into the service of the empire and the hearts core of the roman legion was composed of gothic officers and soldiers
i can only say that i have laboured honestly and industriously to discover the truth even in its minutest details and to sketch the age its manners and its literature as i found them altogether artificial slipshod effete resembling far more the times of louis quinze than those of sophocles and plato
and the new blood at the era of this story was at hand

preface
but now the main body had arrived
they brought before the minds of churchmen a thousand new questions which must be solved unless the church was to relinquish for ever her claims as the great teacher and satisfier of the human soul
he dare not tell how evil people were he will not be believed if he tells how good they were
by charles kingsley
how iniquitous was the conduct of the sons of theodosius in refusing the usual bounty by which the goths were bribed not to attack the empirethe whole pent up deluge burst over the plains of italy and the western empire became from that day forth a dying idiot while the new invaders divided europe among themselves
so thought many then and as i believe not unwisely
that very peculiar turn of the graeco eastern mind which made them the great thinkers of the then world had the effect of drawing them away from practice to speculation and the races of egypt and syria were effeminate over civilised exhausted by centuries during which no infusion of fresh blood had come to renew the stock
for a time had arrived in which no teacher who did not put forth the most lofty pretensions to righteousness could expect a hearing
a picture of life in the fifth century must needs contain much which will be painful to any reader and which the young and innocent will do well to leave altogether unread
hypatia
for somewhat more than four hundred years the roman empire and the christian church born into the world almost at the same moment had been developing themselves side by side as two great rival powers in deadly struggle for the possession of the human race
monastic isolation from family and national duties especially fitted the fathers of that period for the task by giving them leisure if nothing else to face questions with a lifelong earnestness impossible to the more social and practical northern mind
the egyptian and syrian churches therefore were destined to labour not for themselves but for us
in the present case that disadvantage is doubled for while the sins of the church however heinous were still such as admit of being expressed in words the sins of the heathen world against which she fought were utterly indescribable and the christian apologist is thus compelled for the sake of decency to state the churchs case far more weakly than the facts deserve
this is a librivox recording
and their strength was felt at once
here and there an abuse was lopped off or an edict was passed for the visitation of prisons and for the welfare of prisoners or a theodosius was recalled to justice and humanity for a while by the stern rebukes of an ambrose
the fifteen years before the time of this tale had decided the fate of greece the last four that of rome itself
it has to represent a very hideous though a very great age one of those critical and cardinal eras in the history of the human race in which virtues and vices manifest themselves side by sideeven at times in the same personwith the most startling openness and power
and he who excited the craving was also furnishing that which would satisfy it and was teaching mankind by a long and painful education to distinguish the truth from its innumerable counterfeits and to find for the first time in the worlds life a good news not merely for the select few but for all mankind without respect of rank or race
how can he whose sphere lies above the stars stoop every moment to earth
the inexpressible must be expressed the work must be done if it cost me the squaring of the circle
yes
strange that men should be content to grovel and be men when they might rise to the rank of gods
foolishfoolish of me a philosopher
i quite agree that there are very great practical inconveniences of this kind in the newi mean the catholic faith but the world is full of inconveniences
if those christians would but lend me their money instead of building alms houses and hospitals with it they might burn the jews quarter to morrow for aught i care
but while we are in this prison house of matter we must wear our chain even wear it gracefully if we have the good taste and make the base necessities of this body of shame symbolic of the divine food of the reason
why not
we shall conquer yet
if there is faith in pythagoras the symbol should be an expanding series of the powers of three and yet that accursed binary factor will introduce itself
for aught i know or care the plot may be an exactly opposite one and the christians intend to murder all the jews
ah so they sayyour excellent father has vanished
on the left of the garden stretched the lofty eastern front of the museum itself with its picture galleries halls of statuary dining halls and lecture rooms one huge wing containing that famous library founded by the father of philadelphus which hold in the time of seneca even after the destruction of a great part of it in caesars siege four hundred thousand manuscripts
recollect that you are a christian answered hypatia half smiling
listen
but there is my father pacing up and down in the library
does your excellency or this proud bishop govern alexandria
how the finances of the provinces would go on without their kind assistance i dare not think
he was a greek also but of a more common and perhaps lower type dark and fiery thin and graceful his delicate figure and cheeks wasted by meditation harmonised well with the staid and simple philosophic cloak which he wore as a sign of his profession
well my dear lady and has not the villainous demagogue got the whole mob on his side
ah that your excellency but saw the great duel which depends on you alone
his excellency madam the prefect
but now
justice
what men those barbarians do breed
i expect every time i ride to have my brains knocked out by some mad monk
you have tasted no food yet this day
the alcoves are silent
you must not be hard on us
i to believe against the authority of porphyry himself too in evil eyes and magic
i will ask the prefect to find out who she is and get rid of her before she fascinates me with that evil eye
however i got rid of them quoted all the geographical lies i had ever heard and a great many more quickened their appetite for their fools errand notably and started them off again
did not you work the sum out once hypatia
but how go on the schools
the oracles are dumb
i was afraid of being crushed under the elephants foot at every step i took with him
but i must take some notice of the letter
six new pupils in the mathematical school this morning
in an age when as has been well and often said emperors and consulars crawl to the tombs of a tent maker and a fisherman and kiss the mouldy bones of the vilest slaves

to tell you the truth he had some forty stout countrymen of his with him who might have been troublesome to a perplexed prefect not to mention that it is always as well to keep on good terms with these goths
ah fairest wisdom dont mention that horrid word out of the lecture room
in theory it is all very well but in poor imperfect earthly practice a governor must be content with doing very much what comes to hand

what do i care for food
and as for the great brute himself he has rank enough in his wayboasts of his descent from some cannibal god or otherreally hardly deigned to speak to a paltry roman governor till his faithful and adoring bride interceded for me

school after school they had all walked and taught and sung there beneath the spreading planes and chestnuts figs and palm trees
really after the sack of rome and athens cleaned out like a beehive by wasps things begin to look serious
let them go
that it never will be as long as hypatia lives to illuminate the earth and as far as i am concerned i promise you a clear stage anda great deal of favour as is proved by my visiting you publicly at this moment before i have given audience to one of the four hundred bores great and small who are waiting in the tribunal to torment me
and why should that disturb me
he paced impatiently up and down the chamber while his keen glittering eyes and restless gestures betokened intense inward thought i have it
well i will eat and be ashamed of eating
why not among a people whose god is the crucified son of a carpenter
i plead guilty myself
here is the precious documentdo look at it in pity
it grows
what am i to do
the statues there are broken
stay did i tell you
and to whom pray
it spreads
if the gods have deserted their oracles they have not deserted the souls who aspire to them
why if anything did happen after all conceive the missives which would be sent flying off to constantinople against me
you philosophers however raised above your own bodies you may be must really not forget that we poor worldlings have bones to be broken
there it towered up the wonder of the world its white roof bright against the rainless blue and beyond it among the ridges and pediments of noble buildings a broad glimpse of the bright blue sea
well there will be less loss to the empire if i have to crucify a dozen or two as i positively will the next riot
there is fruit with lentils and rice waiting for you in the next room and bread unless you despise it too much
thank the gods there she moves away
it is really a great comfort to a statesman that the masses are so well aware that they deserve hanging and therefore so careful to prevent any danger of public justice depopulating the province
i see her everywheretill the last month at leastand here she is again
that is my bitterest grief to see those who have been pretending in the morning lecture room to worship every word of mine as an oracle lounging in the afternoon round pelagias litter and then at nightfor i know that they do itthe dice and the wine and worse
to show oneself superior to the herd by seeing boundless depths of living glory in myths which have become dark and dead to them
and multiplying i dont doubt
but out of the lecture room i prefer a practical expedient for instance cyril writes to me hereplague on him he would not let me even have a weeks hunting in peace that there is a plot on the part of the jews to murder all the christians
the place seemed fragrant with all the riches of greek thought and song since the days when ptolemy philadelphus walked there with euclid and theocritus callimachus and lycophron
if they have ceased to guide nations they have not ceased to speak to their own elect

addisons note was a fiction in which unconnected fragments of his lucubrations were purposely jumbled together in as odd a manner as he could in order to produce a laughable effect
it must indeed be allowed that the structure of his sentences is expanded and often has somewhat of the inversion of latin and that he delighted to express familiar thoughts in philosophical language being in this the reverse of socrates who it was said reduced philosophy to the simplicity of common life

he certainly was mistaken or if he imagined at first that he was imitating temple he was very unsuccessful for nothing can be more unlike than the simplicity of temple and the richness of johnson
the disposition to derision and insult is awakened by the softness of foppery the swell of insolence the liveliness of levity or the solemnity of grandeur by the sprightly trip the stately stalk the formal strut and the lofty mien by gestures intended to catch the eye and by looks elaborately formed as evidences of importance

you are however not to make unkind inferences when i forbear to reply to your kindness for be assured i never receive a letter from you without great pleasure and a very warm sense of your generosity and friendship which i heartily blame myself for not cultivating with more care

it can be accounted for only in this way that by reading and meditation and a very close inspection of life he had accumulated a great fund of miscellaneous knowledge which by a peculiar promptitude of mind was ever ready at his call and which he had constantly accustomed himself to clothe in the most apt and energetick expression

if you write down minutely what you remember of her from your earliest years you will read it with great pleasure and receive from it many hints of soothing recollection when time shall remove her yet farther from you and your grief shall be matured to veneration
why have you thrown that away asked boris
berg and boris having rested after yesterdays march were sitting clean and neatly dressed at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to them playing chess
i say berg my dear fellow said rostov when you get a letter from home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk everything over with and i happen to be there ill go at once to be out of your way
its a lackeys job
so far everythings all right but i confess i should much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front
you know of course that his imperial highness rode with our regiment all the time so that we had every comfort and every advantage
but our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemys fire
still i remained silent
boris made a grimace
after reading a few lines he glanced angrily at berg then meeting his eyes hid his face behind the letter
i am speaking of the staff in general
berg who had obtained his captaincy during the campaign had gained the confidence of his superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money matters very satisfactorily
but thats not the point
our stories have some weight not like the stories of those fellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything
both had changed greatly since they last met and both were in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them
in the middle of his story just as he was saying you cannot imagine what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack prince andrew whom boris was expecting entered the room
go across to our hosts they invited you added boris
berg held a smoking pipe between his knees
he would drink with you
i only sent you the note yesterday by bolkonskian adjutant of kutuzovs whos a friend of mine
it was not a matter of life but rather of death as the saying is
on the twelfth of november kutuzovs active army in camp before olmutz was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two emperorsthe russian and the austrian
he looked intently and inquiringly into his friends eyes evidently trying in vain to find the answer to some question
in spite of prince andrews disagreeable ironical tone in spite of the contempt with which rostov from his fighting army point of view regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer was evidently one rostov felt confused blushed and became silent
as for us count we get along on our pay
what dinners and balls
at that moment the door opened
eh is she pretty he asked with a wink
well how are you going to get out of that he remarked
berg returned and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three officers became animated
why
they spoke of the sayings and doings of their commander the grand duke and told stories of his kindness and irascibility
besides to tell everything as it really happened it would have been necessary to make an effort of will to tell only what happened
i did not think he would get it to you so quickly
this letter would be of great use to you
i say send for some wine
do go somewhere anywhere to the devil he exclaimed and immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking amiably into his face evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his words he added dont be hurt my dear fellow you know i speak from my heart as to an old acquaintance
with a pleasant smile berg related how the grand duke had ridden up to him in a violent passion shouting arnauts arnauts was the tsarevichs favorite expression when he was in a rage and called for the company commander
he wanted to pinch him push him do anything but kiss hima thing everybody did
yes yes said boris with a smile
the guards just arrived from russia spent the night ten miles from olmutz and next morning were to come straight to the review reaching the field at olmutz by ten oclock
of whom you imagine me to be one said prince andrew with a quiet and particularly amiable smile
yes many stories
why not inquired boris
they had not met for nearly half a year and being at the age when young men take their first steps on lifes road each saw immense changes in the other quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken those first steps
i cant tell you
were you there
the next day it was not even mentioned in the orders of the day
what nonsense
as to your business prince andrew continued addressing boris we will talk of it later and he looked round at rostov
his hearers expected a story of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement he had flown like a storm at the square cut his way in slashed right and left how his saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted and so on
they had come by easy stages their knapsacks conveyed on carts and the austrian authorities had provided excellent dinners for the officers at every halting place
come to me after the review and we will do what is possible
boris rose to meet rostov but in doing so did not omit to steady and replace some chessmen that were falling
he had on a shabby cadet jacket decorated with a soldiers cross equally shabby cadets riding breeches lined with worn leather and an officers saber with a sword knot
i quite understand said berg getting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice
why
i want nothing and i wont be anyones adjutant
i did not expect you today he added
oh dear what a beast i am muttered rostov as he read the letter
he ordered his horse at once and coldly taking leave of boris rode home
he asked him to tell them how and where he got his wound
i cant
indeed
yes stories repeated rostov loudly looking with eyes suddenly grown furious now at boris now at bolkonski
oh you damned dandies
he is a very very nice honest and pleasant fellow answered boris
glancing however at boris he saw that he too seemed ashamed of the hussar of the line
dear me how you have changed
the german landlady hearing rostovs loud voice popped her head in at the door
well how are you
been under fire already asked boris
what receptions we had in poland
clean and fresh as if youd been to a fete not like us sinners of the line cried rostov with martial swagger and with baritone notes in his voice new to boris pointing to his own mud bespattered breeches
the pavlograds held feast after feast celebrating awards they had received for the campaign and made expeditions to olmutz to visit a certain caroline the hungarian who had recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses
berg took the opportunity to ask with great politeness whether as was rumored the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be doubled
thats what keeping ones head means
i can tell you for myself
boris inquired what news there might be on the staff and what without indiscretion one might ask about our plans
and berg too
however he added rising you know my name and where to find me but dont forget that i do not regard either myself or you as having been at all insulted and as a man older than you my advice is to let the matter drop
and so he told them all that
but notwithstanding this boris embraced him in a quiet friendly way and kissed him three times
the guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip parading their cleanliness and discipline
well as you see
and we too have had a splendid march
prince andrew who liked to help young men was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed toward boris who had managed to please him the day before he wished to do what the young man wanted
now im very glad very glad indeed that my brother has distinguished himself so
its true that all you women are crybabies remarked petya pacing the room with large resolute strides
petya paced the room in silence for a time
sonya became thoughtful
himi just shut my eyes and remember but boris
dont come in she said to the old count who was following her
im not going to
what
no
and so it was decided to send the letters and money by the grand dukes courier to boris and boris was to forward them to nicholas
not a word about himself
no she shut her eyes no theres nothing at all
not till midwinter was the count at last handed a letter addressed in his sons handwriting
her face wore the proud expression of a surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation and admits the public to appreciate his skill
if id been in nikolenkas place i would have killed even more of those frenchmen he said
shall you write to him she asked
anna mikhaylovna though her circumstances had improved was still living with the rostovs
she felt that sonya was speaking the truth that there was such love as sonya was speaking of
thank god said sonya crossing herself
vera natasha sonya and petya now entered the room and the reading of the letter began
you wont
on retiring to her own room she sat in an armchair her eyes fixed on a miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox while the tears kept coming into her eyes
do you remember him natasha suddenly asked after a moments silence
i remember nikolenka too i remember him well she said
not forgetting anyone
anna mikhaylovna practical woman that she was had even managed by favor with army authorities to secure advantageous means of communication for herself and her son
she rushed to sonya hugged her and began to cry
a letter from nikolenka
hold your tongue petya what a goose you are
auntie darling do tell me what it is
my dear friend said she in a tone of pathetic inquiry prepared to sympathize in any way
and i should be ashamed to write to boris
its not that i dont rememberi know what he is like but not as i remember nikolenka
when she saw the count she stretched out her arms to him embraced his bald head over which she again looked at the letter and the portrait and in order to press them again to her lips she slightly pushed away the bald head
do i remember nicholas
then i will go and tell at once
now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero would it be right to remind him of herself and as it might seem of the obligations to her he had taken on himself
petya youre a stupid said natasha
i dont know
no sonya but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly remember everything said natasha with an expressive gesture evidently wishing to give her words a very definite meaning
bold as she was natasha who knew how sensitive her mother was to anything relating to nikolenka did not venture to ask any questions at dinner but she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on her chair regardless of her governess remarks
sonya smiled
i think if he writes i will write too she said blushing
i dont remember him a bit
the count sobbed yet more
what nasty brutes they are
from all he says one should be glad and not cry
and how he has remembered everybody
but i dont remember boris
a little wound but he has been made an officer he is well now he wrote himself said she through her tears
but natasha had not yet felt anything like it
nothing my dear
what a style
it was long since the rostovs had news of nicholas
the count put his ear to the keyhole and listened
natasha smiled through her tears
anna mikhaylovna opened the door
im not a goose but they are who cry about trifles said petya
anna mikhaylovna with the letter came on tiptoe to the countess door and paused
why should you be ashamed
how charmingly he describes said she reading the descriptive part of the letter
but perhaps she deceived you
about some denisov or other though he himself i dare say is braver than any of them
nicholas was all sonya said instantly turning white
no dearest sweet one honey i wont give upi know you know something
she had opportunities of sending her letters to the grand duke constantine pavlovich who commanded the guards
and what a soul
i always said when he was only so highi always said
after dinner she rushed head long after anna mikhaylovna and dashing at her flung herself on her neck as soon as she overtook her in the sitting room
she believed it could be but did not understand it
he says nothing about his sufferings
let us go to mamma
well i dont know
no on my true word of honor said natasha crossing herself i wont tell anyone and she ran off at once to sonya
come later and she went in closing the door behind her
not a word
natasha looked at sonya with wondering and inquisitive eyes and said nothing
her sons growth toward manhood at each of its stages had seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed the millions of human beings who grew up in the same way
in the spring he was taken to montreal or quebec for trial and was honorably acquitted
maurice gerald was not the mannor louise poindexter the womanto shun such a consummation
he had no suspicionnot the slightest
the noose settled over the cutwater of the skiff and closing around the stem enabled him to tow the tiny craft to the side on which he stood
it was a glance of inquiry ending in a look of chagrin with some muttered phrases that rendered it more emphatic
they are but lukewarm lovers who can content themselves with a dialogue carried on at bowshot distance
her ready obedience had almost influenced him to regret the prohibition walking in confidence by day and sleeping in security by night he fancied it might be recalled
in an instant after he stood upon the bank at the convexity of the rivers bend and directly opposite the spot where a skiff was moored under the sombre shadow of a gigantic cotton tree
if he be abroad theres a good chance of his seeing me on the open ground not that i should care a straw if it were only myself to be compromised
it is also known that at the same place it traversed a stretch of open prairie with only a piece of copsewood midway between two extensive tracts of chapparal
leaping out he secured it as it had been before against the drift of the current and then taking stand under the shadow of the cotton tree he appeared to await either a signal or the appearance of some one expected by appointment
becoming satisfied that no one was there he raised the loop end of his lazofor it was this he carried over his armand giving it half a dozen whirls in the air cast it across the stream
the sagittary correspondence could not last for long
he could well concede so much to her caprice since her staying at home could be no disadvantage to the cause that had prompted him to the stern counsel
by saint patrick i see no alternative but risk it
no i must chance it in the clear light
here goes
chapter thirty one
saying this with a swift but stealthy step the dismounted horseman glided across the treeless tract and soon readied the escarpment of the cliff that formed the second height of land rising above the channel of the leona
for a short while he stood gazing across the stream with a glance that told of scrutiny
it is already known that this road passed the hacienda of casa del corvo at some distance from the house and on the opposite side of the river
no use waiting for that beauty to go to bed
twice had they stood together in that garden grovetwice had they exchanged love vowsunder the steel grey light of the stars and a third interview had been arranged between them
on reaching the copse he dismounted led his horse in among the underwood hitched him by looping his bridle rein around the topmost twigs of an elastic bough then detaching a long rope of twisted horsehair from the horn of his saddle and inserting his arm into its coil he glided out to the edge of the island on that side that lay towards the hacienda
little suspected the proud planterperhaps prouder of his daughter than anything else he possessedthat she was daily engaged in an act of rebellionthe wildest against which parental authority may pronounce itself
its very monstrosity would have disarmed him had the thought been suggested
he did not stay ten seconds in this conspicuous situation but by a path that zigzagged down the bluffand with which he appeared familiarhe descended to the river bottom
could he have but dreamt it when slumbering upon his soft couch the dream would have startled him from his sleep like the call of the eternal trumpet
his own daughterhis only daughterof the best blood of southern aristocracy beautiful accomplished everything to secure him a splendid allianceholding nightly assignation with a horse hunter
the droll conceit which has so oft amused the nocturnal inebriate of great cities appeared to produce a like affect upon the night patroller of the prairie and for a moment the shadow late darkening his brow disappeared
hearts brimful of passion must beat and burn togetherin close proximityeach feeling the pulsation of the other if there be an elysium on earth it is this
she dont go down for hours and theres not the sign of a cloud
a stream cleverly crossed
he did not find such as have deserved a place in history
it was garcilaso de la vega the prince of spanish poesy the spanish petrarch according to his fellow countrymen
montmorency signed a similar one for piedmont
the dauphin henry and his brother charles duke of orleans arriving boot and spur from provence came up at this moment shouting likewise hurrah for the emperor and the king charles the fifth dropped on his knees says the narrator and embraced the two young princes affectionately
in those days of war and discord fraught with violence there was no man who was more personally rough and violent than montmorency
he was a man of capacity who had the gift of resolutely continuing a moderate course of policy well calculated to gain time but insufficient for the settlement of great and difficult questions
charles put the ring on his finger and taking from his neck the collar of the order the golden fleece he was wearing he put it upon the kings neck
for two months charles the fifth prosecuted this campaign without a fight marching through the whole of provence an army which fatigue shortness of provisions sickness and ambuscades were decimating ingloriously
queen eleanor before long went and tapped at his door and sent word to the king that the emperor was awake
queen mary of hungary his sister and deputy in the government of the low countries advised a local truce his other sister eleanor the queen of france was of the same opinion francis the first adopted it and the truce in the north was signed for a period of three months
francis with the cardinal de lorraine and the constable de montmorency soon arrived
well brother said the king how do you feel
have you rested well yes said charles i had made such cheer that i was obliged to sleep it off
it was charles the fifth who tackled them
at last he decided upon retreating
in fifteen sixty two at the battle of dreux he was aged and so ill that none expected to see him on horseback
francis did the converse with his own collar only seven of the attendants remained in the emperors chamber and there the two sovereigns conversed for an hour after which they moved to the hall where a splendid supper awaited them
pope paul the third alexander farnese who on the thirteenth of october fifteen thirty four had succeeded clement the seventh came forward as mediator
go hang me such a one he would say according to brantome
on entering the chamber he found the emperor still lying down and chatting with his sister the queen who was seated beside him on a chair
he did accept his disgrace he retired first to chantilly and then to ecouen and there he waited for the dauphin when he became king henry the second to recall him to his side and restore to him the power which francis the first on his very death bed had dissuaded his son from giving back
you dont see then said clement the sevenths ambassador that she brings france three jewels of great price genoa milan and naples when this language was reported at the court of charles the fifth it caused great irritation there
montmorency made up his mind to defend on the whole coast of provence only marseilles and arles he pulled down the ramparts of the other towns which were left exposed to the enemy
they all repaired together to the house prepared for their reception and after dinner the emperor being tired lay down to rest on a couch
the ungratefulnesses of kings are sometimes as capricious as their favors
the tower was taken and charles the fifth avenged his poets death by hanging twenty five of these patriot peasants being all that survived of the fifty who had maintained the defence

rough variety very dense and wiry heightnot exceeding sixteen inches
it is useless to lay down any hard and fast rule as to colour
but puppies are usually sent out to walk and may easily be procured to be kept and reared until they are old enough to be entered to their work doubtless the rearing of a harrier puppy is a great responsibility but it is also a delight to many who feel that they are helping in the advancement of a great national sport
earslong set on low fine in texture and hanging in a graceful fold close to the cheek
either is a good workable size and such hounds should be able to slip along fast enough for most people
noseblack broad and nostrils well expanded
beagle owners like the masters of foxhound kennels have never been very partial to the ordinary dog shows and so the development of the uptodate beagle as seen at recent shows is somewhat new
there is nothing to surpass the beauty of the beagle either to see him on the flags of his kennel or in unravelling a difficulty on the line of a dodging hare
then they seemed to spring from every part of the country
dorsetshire used to be the great county for beagles
sixty years ago such hounds were common enough but possibly through the adoption of the more prevalent plan of beating coverts and spaniels being in more general use the vocation of the beagle in this particular direction died out and a big rough coated beagle is now very rarely seen
colourany recognised hound colour
sternmoderate length set on high thick and carried gaily but not curled over the back
there was the cheshire the christ church oxford mr t johnsons the royal rock the thorpe satchville the worcestershire etc and of late there have been many more that are as well known as packs of foxhounds
nevertheless in general appearance the harrier and the foxhound are very much alike the one obvious distinction being that of size
coatsmooth variety smooth very dense and not too fine or short
it is quite possible therefore that the beagle was crossed with the welsh southern or otterhound to get more size and power as there certainly was a welsh rough coated beagle of good eighteen inches and an almost identical contemporary that was called the essex beagle
then how quick he is in his casts and when he is fairly on a line of course he sticks to it as the saying is like a beagle
it is so much a matter of individual taste
opinions differ as to what standard of height it is advisable to aim at
neckmoderately long slightly arched the throat showing some dewlap
bodyshort between the couplings well let down in chest ribs fairly well sprung and well ribbed up with powerful and not tucked up loins hind quartersvery muscular about the thighs stifles and hocks well bent and hocks well let down
it is just as it should be and if more people take up beagling it may not be in the least surprising
as in the case of the foxhound the harrier is very seldom kept as a companion apart from the pack
if you want to hunt your harriers on foot sixteen inches is quite big enoughalmost too big to run with but if you are riding to them twenty inches is a useful height or even nineteen inches
the uses of the beagle in the early days of the last century however were a good deal diversified
shouldersclean and slightly sloping
the downs there were exactly fitted for them and years ago when roe deer were preserved on the large estates beagles were used to hunt this small breed of deer
in eighteen ninety six one became well acquainted with many packs that had apparently held aloof from the dog shows
description of the beagle headfair length powerful without being coarse skull domed moderately wide with an indication of peak stop well defined muzzle not snipy and lips well flewed
feetround well knuckled up and strongly padded
pocket beagles must not exceed ten inches
eyesbrown dark hazel or hazel not deep set nor bulgy and with a mild expression
if a stout runner can keep within fairly easy distance of a pack of well bred beagles on the line of a lively jack hare he is in the sort of condition to be generally envied
in neatness he is really the little model of a foxhound
mr cranes beagles were noted at the time and also those of a colonel harding
for whether things exist or do not exist whenever we contemplate their essence we see that it involves neither existence nor duration consequently it cannot be the cause of either the one or the other
corollaryhence it follows that god is not only the cause of things coming into existence but also of their continuing in existence that is in scholastic phraseology god is cause of the being of things essendi rerum
wherefore if the idea of god expressed in the attribute thought or indeed anything else in any attribute of god for we may take any example as the proof is of universal application follows from the necessity of the absolute nature of the said attribute the said thing must necessarily be infinite which was our first point
whatsoever follows from any attribute of god in so far as it is modified by a modification which exists necessarily and as infinite through the said attribute must also exist necessarily and as infinite
but in so far as it possesses the idea of god it is supposed finite
furthermore a thing which thus follows from the necessity of the nature of any attribute cannot have a limited duration
we have now granted therefore thought not constituting the idea of god and accordingly the idea of god does not naturally follow from its nature in so far as it is absolute thought for it is conceived as constituting and also as not constituting the idea of god which is against our hypothesis
proofconceive if it be possible supposing the proposition to be denied that something in some attribute of god can follow from the absolute nature of the said attribute and that at the same time it is finite and has a conditioned existence or duration for instance the idea of god expressed in the attribute thought
for if it can suppose a thing which follows from the necessity of the nature of some attribute to exist in some attribute of god for instance the idea of god expressed in the attribute thought and let it be supposed at some time not to have existed or to be about not to exist
therefore the idea of god expressed in thought or anything which necessarily follows from the absolute nature of some attribute of god cannot have a limited duration but through the said attribute is eternal which is our second point bear in mind that the same proposition may be affirmed of anything which in any attribute necessarily follows from gods absolute nature
this will be made still clearer by the following corollary
god is the efficient cause not only of the existence of things but also of their essence
all things which follow from the absolute nature of any attribute of god must always exist and be infinite or in other words are eternal and infinite through the said attribute
the essence of things produced by god does not involve existence
corollaryindividual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of god or modes by which the attributes of god are expressed in a fixed and definite manner
proofthe proof of this proposition is similar to that of the preceding one
every mode which exists both necessarily and as infinite must necessarily follow either from the absolute nature of some attribute of god or from an attribute modified by a modification which exists necessarily and as infinite
for that of which the nature considered in itself involves existence is selfcaused and exists by the sole necessity of its own nature
when the first list was made out to be submitted to the president a difficulty was found to exist which had not occurred either to colonel cooper or myself
he had been appointed neither as a whig nor as a democrat but merely as the fittest candidate for the place in the estimation of the chief of the bureau to which it belonged
although warmly attached to mr pierce personally and entertaining the highest estimate of his character and political principles private and personal reasons led me to decline the offer
i assured the general that this was altogether immaterial adding that it was a very pretty quarrel as it stood and that i had no desire to effect a settlement of it on any inferior issue
the officers of these regiments were chosen partly by selection from those already in service in the regular army and partly by appointment from civil life
under former administrations of the war office it had not been customary to make removals or appointments upon political grounds except in the case of clerkships
thenceforward however i was but little troubled with any pressure for political appointments in the department
this was followed by an invitation to attend the ceremony of his inauguration which took place on the fourth of march eighteen fifty three
the quartermaster general on hearing of this conversation hastened to inform me that it was all a mistakethat the appointee to the office had been confounded with his father who was a wellknown whig but that he the son was a democrat
the chief clerk who had been removed by my predecessor had peculiar qualifications for the place and although known to me only officially he was restored to the position
while in washington on this visit i was induced by public considerations to reconsider my determination and accept the office of secretary of war the public records of that period will best show how the duties of that office were performed
to this usage i not only adhered but extended it to include the clerkships also
after some further discussion of the question the visitors withdrew dissatisfied with the result of the interview
i further gave them to understand that the same principle of selection would be followed in similar cases so far as my authority extended
this as i am happy to remember was the only occasion in which the current of my official action while secretary of war was disturbed in any way by sectional or political considerations
inquiries were made with regard to gunpowder which subsequently led to the use of a coarser grain for artillery
chapter four
the only discrimination made was in the more prompt and thorough equipment of the parties for the extreme northern line and this was only because that was supposed to be the most difficult of execution of all the surveys
under instructions from the president the list was therefore revised and modified in accordance with this new element of geographical distribution
during my administration of the war department material changes were made in the models of arms
certainly not i answered
the arguments which i had used as a senator were the military necessity for such means of transportation and the need of safe and rapid communication with the pacific slope to secure its continuance as a part of the union
in the organization and equipment of these parties and in the selection of their officers care was taken to provide for securing full and accurate information upon every point involved in the determination of the route
this was that the officers selected purely on their military record did not constitute a roster conforming to that distribution among the different states which for political considerations it was thought desirable to observethat is to say the number of such officers of southern birth was found to be disproportionately great
a day or two afterward certain democratic members of congress called on me and politely inquired whether it was true that i had appointed a whig to a position in the war office
the hoosier had played the mischief with the gravity of the whole party even the old maid had to put her handkerchief to her face and the young ladys eyes were filled with tears for half an hour afterward
no says the gentleman
swearin says the old preacher is a terrible bad practice and there aint no use in it nohow
we had a good teamspanking horses fine coaches and one of them drivers you read of
yours is a great beef country i believe says the old gentleman
theres very little grazing here and the range is pretty much wore out
there was myself and an old gentleman with large spectacles gold headed cane and a jolly soldering iron looking nose by him was a circus rider whose breath was enough to breed yaller fever and could be felt just as easy as cotton velvet
the old preacher listened to him with evident signs of displeasure twistin and groanin till he couldnt stand it no longer
its astonishin to hear what wonderful things he has seen
this aint no great stock country says he to the old gentleman with the cane
the old gentleman with the cane took a part in the conversation and the hoosier listened without ever opening his head
ah says the old gentleman with the cane
well sir it aint anything else
a man thats got sense enuff to foller his own cow bell with us aint in no danger of starvin
we rolled along for some time
i never enjoyed traveling so well as in the slow coaches
in the course of his argument he undertook to prove the scriptures to be true and told us all about the miracles and prophecies and their fulfilment
the bible says swear not at all and i spose you know the commandments about swearin
a cross old woman came next whose look would have given any reasonable man the double breasted blues before breakfast alongside of her was a rale backwoods preacher with the biggest and ugliest mouth ever got up since the flood
i never was better amused in my life
he was at sodom and gomorrow and seen the place whar lots wife fell
well sir says indiany all ive got to say is if shed dropped in our parts the cattle would have licked her up afore sundown
right out in the open air he asked
then there was nothing said again for some time
such a corps such a time you never did see
well there was nine insiders and i dont believe there ever was a stage full of christians ever started before so chuck full of music
im gwine down to orleans to see if i cant git a contract out of uncle sam to feed the boys whats been lickin them infernal mexicans so bad
by danforth marble
is it possible says the old gentleman
the old gentleman with the cane didnt say nothing and the preacher gave a long groan
ive just heard of a gentleman says the preacher thats been to the holy land and went over the bible country
the young lady smiled through her veil and the old lady snapped her eyes and looked sideways at the speaker
indiany he stuck his mug out of the window and criticized the cattle we now and then passed
im sorry said dan as he knocked the ashes from his regalia as he sat in a small crowd over a glass of sherry at florences new york one eveningim sorry that the stages are disappearing so rapidly
no sir says the old gentleman
he shut his mouth right in the middle of what he was sayin and looked at the preacher while his face got as red as fire
i was wishing somebody would give the conversation a start when indiany made a break
ive made a good many passages over the alleghanies and across ohio from cleveland to columbus and cincinnati all over the south down east and up north in stages and i generally had a good time
what says the hoosier real genewine good salt
dont make much beef here i reckon says the hoosier
yes sir he seen the salt standin thar to this day
yes standin right in the open field whar she fell
my friend says he you must excuse me but your conversation would be a great deal more interesting to meand im sure would please the company much betterif you wouldnt swear so terribly
when i passed over from cleveland to cincinnati the last time in a stage i met a queer crowd
the scene is wholly enchanting and such a view from some sheltered sunny corner in a garden which blazes with masses of red and golden flowers tends to feelings of inexpressible satisfaction with all things
the water gained in spite of every effort
the large green tent was put up and proper supports made for it
through stormy seas
the engine room staff and andersons people on the engines scientists were stowing their laboratories the cook refitting his galley and so forthnot a single spot but had its band of workers
oates and atkinson with intermittent assistance from others were busy keeping the ponies on their legs
even our poor animals will get rest and sleep in spite of the violent motion
yesterday he was developing plates with the developing dish in one hand and an ordinary basin in the other
meanwhile the huts were erected on the waste ground beyond the harbour works
i think priestley is the most seriously incapacitated by sea sicknessothers who might be as bad have had some experience of the ship and her movement
thank god the gale is abating
we are not out of the wood but hope dawns as indeed it should for me when i find myself so wonderfully served
bowers attacked the ships stores surveyed relisted and restowed them saving very much space by unstowing numerous cases and stowing the contents in the lazarette
the outlook appeared grim
everything was overhauled sorted and marked afresh to prevent difficulty in the south
to use the pump it was necessary to go ahead
to town hall to see mayor
kinsey will act as my agent in christchurch during my absence i have given him an ordinary power of attorney and i think have left him in possession of all facts
tales of ponies down came frequently from forward where oates and atkinson laboured through the entire night
meares with some helpers had constantly to be rescuing these wretched creatures from hanging and trying to find them better shelter an almost hopeless task
everything seems to have gone without a hitch
the seas continually break on the weather bulwarks and scatter clouds of heavy spray over the backs of all who must venture into the waist of the ship
ponting busy with cinematograph
the first three weeks of november have gone with such a rush that i have neglected my diary and can only patch it up from memory
on one occasion i was waist deep when standing on the rail of the poop
we have managed to wedge in all the dog biscuits the total weight being about five tons meares is reluctant to feed the dogs on seal but i think we ought to do so during the winter
the ship was over two feet by the stern but this will soon be remedied
the stream which was visible and audible inside the stern has been entirely stopped
all in good spirits except one or two sick
the seas were continually breaking over these people and now and again they would be completely submerged
occasionally a heavy sea would bear one of them away and he was only saved by his chain
without steam the leak can now be kept under with the hand pump by two daily efforts of a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes
meanwhile we have been thinking of a way to get at the suction of the pump a hole is being made in the engine room bulkhead the coal between this and the pump shaft will be removed and a hole made in the shaft
when the ship came out of dock she presented a scene of great industry
the bilge pump is dependent on the main engine
our meals are simple enough but it is really remarkable to see the manner in which our two stewards hooper and neald provide for all requirements washing up tidying cabin and making themselves generally useful in the cheerfullest manner
there are generally one or two on watch which eases matters but it is a squash
awoke to much motion
the sea is still mountainously high but the ship is not labouring so heavily as she was
we walked over the hills to sumner
we managed to get three tons of ice one hundred sixty two carcases of mutton and three carcases of beef besides some boxes of sweetbreads and kidneys into this space
soon we were plunging heavily and taking much water over the lee rail
we stayed with the kinseys at their house te han at clifton
chapter one
lashley to his neck in rushing water stuck gamely to the work of clearing suctions
it blew very hard and the sea got up at once
we are not taking any corn
from four oclock last night the wind freshened with great rapidity and very shortly we were under topsails jib and staysail only
with so much water coming on board it is impossible to open the hatch over the shaft
what was to be done
all these cases are covered with stout tarpaulin and lashed with heavy chain and rope lashings so that they may be absolutely secure
things for the moment appeared very black
the dates seem unimportant but throughout the period the officers and men of the ship have been unremittingly busy
the dogs sit with their tails to this invading water their coats wet and dripping
not a single one has lost his good spirits
his interest in the expedition is wonderful and such interest on the part of a thoroughly shrewd business man is an asset of which i have taken full advantage
we came home in the harbour tug two other tugs followed the ship out and innumerable small boats
williams had to confess he was beaten and must draw fires
at such times they had to cling for dear life to some fixture to prevent themselves being washed overboard and with coal bags and loose cases washing about there was every risk of such hold being torn away
a great mass of people assembled
ship pitching with south westerly swell
his kindness to us was beyond words
the extra consists of five tons of hay five or six tons of oil cake four or five tons of bran and some crushed oats
anton is suffering badly from sea sickness but last night he smoked a cigar
found all well on board
wilson mrs evans and k left at heads and back in harbour tug
far away beyond the plains are the mountains ever changing their aspect and yet farther in over this northern sweep of sea can be seen in clear weather the beautiful snow capped peaks of the kaikouras
if anything more craft following us than at lytteltonmrs
another dog has just been washed overboardalas
it is a pathetic attitude deeply significant of cold and misery occasionally some poor beast emits a long pathetic whine
the voyage out
pennell swung the ship for compass adjustment then away
abaft the fore hatch is the ice house
williams is working in sweltering heat behind the boiler to get the door made in the bulkhead
millers men were building horse stalls caulking the decks resecuring the deckhouses putting in bolts and various small fittings
there are four ponies outside the forecastle and to leeward of the fore hatch and on the whole perhaps with shielding tarpaulins they have a rather better time than their comrades
a third sledge stands across the break of the poop in the space hitherto occupied by the after winch
miller made the excellent job in overcoming this difficulty which i expected and since the ship has been afloat and loaded the leak is found to be enormously reduced
bright sunshine
rhodes met us timaru
we left port chalmers with four hundred sixty two tons of coal on board rather a greater quantity than i had hoped for and yet the load mark was three inches above the water
the sacks containing this last added to the goods already mentioned make a really heavy deck cargo and one is naturally anxious concerning it but everything that can be done by lashing and securing has been done
below one knows all space is packed as tight as human skill can deviseand on deck
from this moment about four a m the engine room became the centre of interest
the afterguard were organised in two parties by evans to work buckets the men were kept steadily going on the choked hand pumpsthis seemed all that could be done for the moment and what a measure to count as the sole safeguard of the ship from sinking practically an attempt to bale her out
meanwhile our good friend miller attacked the leak and traced it to the stern
we manage somehow to find a seat for everyone at our cabin table although the wardroom contains twenty four officers
you know how carefully everything had been lashed but no lashings could have withstood the onslaught of these coal sacks for long they acted like battering rams
we found the false stem split and in one case a hole bored for a long stem through bolt which was much too large for the bolt
wilson joined train
the final preparations in new zealand
the ship a queer and not altogether cheerful sight under the circumstances
within five days she was in dock
some four or five tons of fodder and the ever watchful anton take up the remainder of the forecastle space
before the ship left dock bowers and wyatt were at work again in the shed with a party of stevedores sorting and relisting the shore party stores
found all well
there was nothing for it but to grapple with the evil and nearly all hands were labouring for hours in the waist of the ship heaving coal sacks overboard and re lashing the petrol cases etc in the best manner possible under such difficult and dangerous circumstances
the carcases are stowed in tiers with wooden battens between the tiersit looks a triumph of orderly stowage and i have great hope that it will ensure fresh mutton throughout our winter
oates has gradually persuaded us that this is insufficient and our pony food weight has gone up to forty five tons besides three or four tons for immediate use
they must perforce be chained up and they are given what shelter is afforded on deck but their position is not enviable
we have run one hundred ninety miles to day a good start but inconvenient in one respectwe have been making for campbell island but early this morning it became evident that our rapid progress would bring us to the island in the middle of the night instead of to morrow as i had anticipated
the amount of water which was being made with the ship so roughly handled was most uncertain
later in the day the wind has veered to the westward heading us slightly
and geraint came to where arthur was and saluted him heaven protect thee said arthur and the welcome of heaven be unto thee
then they set forth towards the court of arthur
and that night they went to sleep
and arthur gave away the maiden to geraint
and the day after the followers of arthur intended to go away
and so they came to the palace
and he greets thee well as an uncle should greet his nephew and as a vassal should greet his lord
and that day and that night were spent in the utmost enjoyment
and thereupon her fame increased and her friends became more in number than before
i am lord said he and i have met with much trouble and received wounds unsupportable then he told arthur all his adventure
and the steward of the household so ordered her
and the neighboring chiefs knowing this grow insolent towards him and covet his land and possessions
and unto him he represents that it were better for him to spend the flower of his youth and the prime of his age in preserving his own boundaries than in tournaments which are productive of no profit although he obtains glory in them
now this is how arthur hunted the stag
and they passed that day and that night in the utmost enjoyment
it is too soon for you to go away yet said he stay with me until i have finished receiving the homage of my chief men who have agreed to come to me and they remained with him until he had done so
and the head of the stag was given to enid
and kadyriath came to them to know what were their requests
rightly did i judge said she concerning the head of the stag that it should not be given to any until geraints return and behold here is a fit occasion for bestowing it
and they all said that it would be the fulness of joy and honor to them for geraint to come and receive their homage
and the next day the ambassadors were permitted to depart and they were told that geraint should follow them
and guenever was sorry when she saw the condition he was in even though he was accompanied by the churlish dwarf
and there was great rejoicing and gladness throughout the whole court and through all the country concerning geraint because of the greatness of their love to him and of the greatness of the fame which he had gained since he went from amongst them and because he was come to take possession of his dominions and to preserve his boundaries
heaven prosper you said arthur and whence do you come
and they were not long in giving so eager was every one to bestow gifts and of those who came to ask gifts none departed unsatisfied
and arthur told geraint the cause of the mission and of the coming of the ambassadors to him out of cornwall
enid
and every one asked that which he desired and the followers of arthur began to make gifts and immediately the men of cornwall came and gave also
miserable and broken is the armor that he wears and the hue of blood is more conspicuous upon it than its own color knowest thou his name said she
and that day and that night were spent in abundance of feasting
and from that time she became his wife
he was the chief physician
and geraint went to bear them company and enid also as far as diganwy there they parted
i know not who they are said he but i know said guenever this is the knight whom geraint pursued and methinks that he comes not here by his own free will
and in the court they had ample entertainment and a multitude of gifts and abundance of liquor and a sufficiency of service and a variety of games
chapter six
and geraint greets thee well and in greeting thee he compelled me to come hither to do thy pleasure for the insult which thy maiden received from the dwarf now where did he overtake thee
and the last dog that was let loose was the favorite dog of arthur cavall was his name
and experienced guides and the chief men of his country went with him
at the place where we were jousting and contending for the sparrow hawk in the town which is now called cardiff
then arthur came to them
one wished that it should be given to the lady best beloved by him and another to the lady whom he loved best
and a year and a second and a third he proceeded thus until his fame had flown over the face of the kingdom
and they came to the court
lord said he behold yonder is guenever and none with her save only one maiden command gildas the son of caw and all the scholars of the court said arthur to attend guenever to the palace and they did so
and the next day arthur satisfied all the claimants upon geraint with bountiful gifts
and he saluted arthur and arthur gazed a long time upon him and was amazed to see him thus
and at the second turn the stag came toward the hunting party of arthur
and guenever caused a watch to be set upon the ramparts for geraints coming
and after midday they beheld an unshapely little man upon a horse and after him a dame or a damsel also on horseback and after her a knight of large stature bowed down and hanging his head low and sorrowfully and clad in broken and worthless armor
lady said he at the gate there is a knight and i saw never a man of so pitiful an aspect to look upon as he
right gladly shall it be so said arthur
yes said he and it was not to my advantage and that was not his fault but mine lady
so he received the homage of such as were there
and thereupon we encountered each other and he left me lady as thou seest sir said she when thinkest thou that geraint will be here to morrow lady i think he will be here with the maiden
and to do honor to geraint all the chief men of the country were invited that night to visit him
and if he live he shall do such satisfaction as shall be judged best by the men of the court
then they all set forth holding converse together concerning the head of the stag to whom it should be given
but geraint has overtaken him and avenged the insult to the maiden to the uttermost and thereupon behold a porter came to the spot where guenever was
and geraint from that time forth loved the hunt and the tournament and hard encounters and he came victorious from them all
then geraint sent ambassadors to the men of cornwall to ask them this
and arthur considered that it would go hard with him to let geraint depart from him and from his court neither did he think it fair that his cousin should be restrained from going to protect his dominions and his boundaries seeing that his father was unable to do so
and the maiden took up her abode in the palace and she had many companions both men and women and there was no maiden more esteemed than she in the island of britain
well said arthur go and divest yourselves of your accoutrements and take food and refresh yourselves after your fatigues and before you go from hence you shall have an answer and they went to eat
and i do not believe that any will begrudge it her for between her and every one here there exists nothing but love and friendship much applauded was this by them all and by arthur also
will i grant to him since it is as insulting to thee that an insult should be offered to me as to thyself thus will it be best to do said arthur let this man have medical care until it be known whether he may live
the men and the dogs were divided into hunting parties and the dogs were let loose upon the stag
lady said he geraint the son of erbin thy best and most valiant servant greets thee did he meet with thee she asked
and arthur caused morgan tud to be called to him
and when it was time for them to go to sleep they went
said geraint i think i shall have enough of knighthood with me and they set forth
behold a good earldom together with myself will i bestow upon thee be therefore happy and joyful i declare to heaven said she that henceforth i shall never be joyful while i live come said he and eat no by heaven i will not but by heaven thou shalt said he
and he became acquainted with valiant and mighty men until he had gained as much fame there as he had formerly done elsewhere
heaven prosper thee said geraint and whence dost thou come
behold then chieftain this is most expedient for thee to do to save me from all reproach come here to morrow and take me away as though i knew nothing thereof i will do so said he
then geraint went to see erbin
and thus also he slew the fourth
and he had a small blue pitcher in his hand and a bowl on the mouth of the pitcher
and he did not choose the pleasantest and most frequented road but that which was the wildest and most beset by thieves and robbers and venomous animals
take heed therefore unto thy possessions until my return
behold what thou must do said he take the four horses and drive them before thee and proceed forward as i bade thee just now
piercing and loud and thrilling was the cry that enid uttered
i will said he and heaven reward thee for it
then he offered her a goblet of liquor
then the third set upon him and he killed him in like manner
and geraint looked upon enid and he was grieved for two causes one was to see that enid had lost her color and her wonted aspect and the other to know that she was in the right
meanwhile geraint followed the giants and overtook them
then they all sat down according to their precedence in honor
these tidings came to erbin
then all left the board and fled away
and at the beginning of the night enid slept a little and at midnight she arose and placed all geraints armor together so that it might be ready to put on
and he rode forward
and although fearful of her errand she came to the side of geraints bed and she spoke to him softly and gently saying my lord arise and clothe thyself for these were the words of the earl to me and his intention concerning me so she told geraint all that had passed
and as they journeyed thus they heard an exceeding loud wailing near to them
and she came and stood over him where he had fallen
one morning in the summer time they were upon their couch and geraint lay upon the edge of it
and when he reached the place where she was he fell down lifeless from his horse
not i by my confession unto heaven said she there is nothing more hateful unto me than this and she knew not what she should do for although it was hard for her to own this to geraint yet was it not more easy for her to listen to what she heard without warning geraint concerning it
and they went up out of the river by a lofty steep and there they met a slender stripling with a satchel about his neck and they saw that there was something in the satchel but they knew not what it was
and there was murmuring and scoffing concerning him among the inhabitants of the palace on account of his relinquishing so completely their companionship for the love of his wife
then he asked of geraint have i thy permission to go and converse with yonder maiden for i see that she is apart from thee thou hast it gladly said he
and he desired enid to mount her horse and to ride forward and to keep a long way before him
so he took her with him to the table against her will and many times desired her to eat
yonder by the high road she replied
but the third turned upon him and struck him with his club so that he split his shield and crushed his shoulder
i wish but for silence and not for warning
when enid saw this she cried out saying o chieftain whoever thou art what renown wilt thou gain by slaying a dead man o heaven said he is it geraint yes in truth said she and who art thou
and say not one word unto me unless i speak first unto thee
the next morning they went to seek physicians and it was not long before they came and they attended geraint until he was perfectly well
when he knew that it was thus he began to love ease and pleasure for there was no one who was worth his opposing
i will do so said he but it is strange to me that thou shouldst go so suddenly
sad and sorrowful was the maiden as she saw all this
leave there the candle said he and desire the man of the house to come here then she went and the man of the house came to him
thereupon she raised a loud and piercing shriek and her lamentations were much greater than they had been before for she considered in her mind that had geraint been alive he durst not have struck her thus
i will prove that i can said she
so the earl went to the place where the maiden was and spake with her
and having drawn it forth again he pierced another of them through likewise
stay thou here said he and i will go and see what is the cause of this wailing i will said she
then the second horseman attacked him furiously being wroth at the death of his companion but with one thrust geraint overthrew him also and killed him as he had done the other
ah lady said he be not so sorrowful for this matter it were hard to persuade me to be otherwise said she
and they were received there with gladness and they met with hospitality and attention
in the evening behold the earl came to visit geraint and his twelve honorable knights with him
and after they had eaten and drank geraint went to sleep and so did enid also
and at the usual hour they went to sleep
so he arose and took his leave and went forth with his attendants
and there was a river before them and the horses bent down and drank of the water
then he went forward into an open glade that was near the road
geraint as he had been used to do when he was at arthurs court frequented tournaments
then they washed and took their repast
what sort of meal he inquired
and she lighted a candle that he might have light to do so
then he rushed upon one of them and thrust his lance through his body
then he arose and said unto her take the horses and ride on and keep straight on as thou didst yesterday and they left the wood and they came to an open country with meadows on one hand and mowers mowing the meadows
so geraint left him thus and returned to enid
i know nothing lord said she of thy meaning neither wilt thou know at this time said he
wilt thou follow my counsel said the youth and take thy meal from me
then he went to sleep in his armor and thus passed the night which was not long at that season
and the two damsels went to the court and when they arrived there geraint was placed upon a little couch in front of the table that was in the hall
and she was very sorrowful
so geraint alighted and the youth took the maiden from off her horse
i will not by heaven said she
so the maiden went forward keeping in advance of geraint as he had desired her and it grieved him as much as his wrath would permit to see a maiden so illustrious as she having so much trouble with the care of the horses
enid
thou hast neither youths nor maidens to serve thee said he
come with me to the court of a son in law of my sister which is near here and thou shalt have the best medical assistance in the kingdom
god be praised that he is well
i beat about my chamber like a silly bird in a cage
write only one word to your own
until my messenger return i can imagine only evil
think of me always
i dare not now own how foolish i was
i have not lain down the whole night
sweetest love let me come on to you
see they fall upon the page
if you feel the least unwell send immediately for advice
i dared not confess to you before what evils i anticipated
i almost wish papa would return though i dread to see him
i know not what to do
god bless you my ferdinand
let us pause
your page is inexorable
he will not let me write another line god bless you my henrietta my beloved my matchless henrietta
how often i was on the point of sending out the household and yet i thought it must be useless and might displease him
they are images full of distress and misery and gloom
heaven be with you and guard over you and cherish you and bless you think always of me
mine own
days must elapse before you can reach bath and i know ferdinand i know your office is more difficult than you will confess but come back my own as soon as you can and write to me at the post office as you settled
no you must not come here
the morning which broke sweet and soft and clear brought ferdinand with its first glimmer a letter from henrietta
o ferdinand what has that separation not cost me
do not think of moving to day
do you know i was so foolish that i thought every flash of lightning must descend on your head
i feel the desolation of this house i am so accustomed to see you here
but i regret it now because my henrietta did not sleep
the storm was magnificent i would not have missed it for the world
how i longed to be with you
my tears are too evident
ferdinand
i know it must be more than a week i know that that prospect was only held out by your affection
he is on my pony he promises to return in a very very short time
i knew not what to do
i do not like to say anything that can annoy you especially at this moment when i feel from my own heart how you must require all the support and solace of unbroken fondness
no pity for them so abounding with love
if you have the slightest cold dearest do not move
i am quite well and love you if that could be more than ever darling to send to see after her ferdinand
farewell ferdinand
henrietta
postpone that journey on which all our hopes are fixed colds bring fever
it seems to me now that happiness can never come again
write to me one line only one line to tell me you are well
i wish to meet him with as much calmness as i can command
it makes the heart ache but to picture such vicissitudes to the imagination
do not keep the messenger an instant
and yet i ought to be grateful that he was uninjured last night
if you knew how desolate this house is
the emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one of the officers as he went have these gentlemen attended to and taken to my bivouac let my doctor larrey examine their wounds
prince repnin named lieutenant sukhtelen
your regiment fulfilled its duty honorably said napoleon
the stretchers moved on
having said this napoleon rode on to meet marshal lannes who hat in hand rode up smiling to the emperor to congratulate him on the victory
there is nothing certain nothing at all except the unimportance of everything i understand and the greatness of something incomprehensible but all important
either to a power indefinable incomprehensible which i not only cannot address but which i cannot even express in wordsthe great all or nothing said he to himself or to that god who has been sewn into this amulet by mary
the flag had already been taken by the french as a trophy
napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield and addressing him again used the epithet young man that was connected in his memory with prince andrew
he did not know how long his unconsciousness lasted
and who is that young man beside you
after looking at him napoleon smiled
fine men remarked napoleon looking at a dead russian grenadier who with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape lay on his stomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide
toward morning all these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness of unconciousness and oblivion which in the opinion of napoleons doctor larrey was much more likely to end in death than in convalescence
bonaparte having come up at a gallop stopped his horse
during this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look about him and even speak
prince andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced but the little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest outside his uniform
prince andrew remembered nothing more he lost consciousness from the terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher the jolting while being moved and the probing of his wound at the dressing station
he is a nervous bilious subject said larrey and will not recover
how do you feel mon brave
everything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the stern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood suffering and the nearness of death aroused in him
he heard the speaker addressed as sire
it was napoleon accompanied by two aides de camp
thats a fine death said napoleon as he gazed at bolkonski
but where am i
which is the senior he asked on seeing the prisoners
suddenly he again felt that he was alive and suffering from a burning lacerating pain in his head
lift this young man up and carry him to the dressing station
ah
the quiet home life and peaceful happiness of bald hills presented itself to him
the soldiers who had carried prince andrew had noticed and taken the little gold icon princess mary had hung round her brothers neck but seeing the favor the emperor showed the prisoners they now hastened to return the holy image
not only did they not interest him but he took no notice of them and at once forgot them
but he heard the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly
well and you young man said he
there are so many prisoners today nearly the whole russian army that he is probably tired of them said another officer
he listened and heard the sound of approaching horses and voices speaking french
he opened his eyes
but to whom should i say that
young man you will go far
i bestow it with pleasure said napoleon
prince andrew who had also been brought forward before the emperors eyes to complete the show of prisoners could not fail to attract his attention
he feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak sickly groan which aroused his own pity
all the same
looking into napoleons eyes prince andrew thought of the insignificance of greatness the unimportance of life which no one could understand and the still greater unimportance of death the meaning of which no one alive could understand or explain
so insignificant at that moment seemed to him all the interests that engrossed napoleon so mean did his hero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appear compared to the lofty equitable and kindly sky which he had seen and understood that he could not answer him
hes very young to come to meddle with us
he collected all his strength to stir and utter a sound
yes i did not know anything anything at all till now
beside him stood a lad of nineteen also a wounded officer of the horse guards
toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still
his face shone with self satisfaction and pleasure
youth is no hindrance to courage muttered sukhtelen in a failing voice
he did not turn his head and did not see those who judging by the sound of hoofs and voices had ridden up and stopped near him
he knew it was napoleonhis herobut at that moment napoleon seemed to him such a small insignificant creature compared with what was passing now between himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over it
at every jolt he again felt unendurable pain his feverishness increased and he grew delirious
very well
why did you not follow him
no doubt growled the chief
you will have to find him block and that speedily within twenty four hoursto day indeedor i will break you like a stick and send you into the gutter
the inspector is there said the guard pointing to the outer room
monsieur you shall hear the exact truth
of course such a consummate ass as you have proved yourself would not think of searching the restaurant or the immediate neighbourhood or of making inquiries as to whether he had been seen or as to which way he had gone
it was a small brass bound note book or diary and was full of close writing in pencil
forgive me monsieur but it is all part of my story
not perfectly but i can read it
he was a colleague
he was much pressed in a great hurry
i suspected nothing when he brought out his pocketbookit was stuffed full monsieur i saw that and my confidence increasedcalled for the reckoning and paid with an italian bank note
it is that or your great gluttony
when block appeared it was evident that something had gone wrong with him
could you
he ate this devilish italian like three and i too i was so hungryforgive me siri did my share
but then who was to tell he meant to run away
how shall i tell you
great heavens you should be the fat man in a fair not an agent of the detective bureau
book
allow me
he was so artful went on block in further extenuation of his offence
i will charge myself with it certainly
i do not understand not more than a word here and there
it lies with those three of coursethe two women and the italian
why let him out of your sight
directly he crossed the threshold he called the first cab and was driving away but he was stopped
i have been unfortunate a victim to circumstances still i believe i know my duty
his overcoat stick this bookhis own private memorandum book seemingly
a woman
tell me said the chief quick this womanwhat was she like did you get her description
stopped but only for a moment and accosted by a woman
i did think of it monsieur but then he the italian was just the same as myself
i was much surprised but he told me his business often brought him here
alas monsieur
idiot
my man should be here by now and i will instruct him at once
and yougreedy gormandizing beastyou agreed
what is it asked the little chief sharply
returned
we are apt at times to expect others to be intuitively possessed of knowledge that has only come to us at a much later date
why did they not keep him then
it is no doubt italian
gone now just when we most want him
you mean arrived
hah that is greatly against him indeed
my gentleman made himself most pleasant
he left everything behind
he has just returned
block
how asked the chief gruffly but obviously much interested
the devil
he never spoke to the manager but walked out and let the change go
never
a minute after my man got up saying
get on get on come to the essential
her faceit was a policeman who saw her and he said she was good looking dark brunette black hair
impossible
of course you have been drinking
and what of your duty your service pray
i have done wrong i confess
no monsieur returned
i have lost him
what say you
he also turned over the pages pausing to read a passage here and there and nodding his head from time to time evidently struck with the importance of the matter recorded
explain
i had no fear of him not till the very last when he played me this evil turn
yes monsieur
his face wore a look of hot flurried excitement and his manner was one of abject cringing self abasement
you cannot mean it
let us proceed in that way
it was all this that helped me to my destruction
that should be at once remarked the commissary eager as usual for decisive action
he has gonedisappeared
how often must i tell you to get on
it is the maid herself cried the little chief springing up and slapping his thigh in exuberant glee
at court there was an endless whispering of lies and calumny and much plotting and planning among the conspiring courtiers to manipulate the king as the instrument of their own purposes
have we not made elaborately permanent the walls of our social compartments
we have forced living souls into a permanent passivity making them incapable of moulding circumstance to their own intrinsic design and of mastering their own destiny
the same thing is happening now with the people of the west
unless we have true faith in freedom knowing it to be creative manfully taking all its risks not only do we lose the right to claim freedom in politics but we also lack the power to maintain it with all our strength
they will be incapable of holding a just freedom in politics and of fighting in freedoms cause
its thoughts are fashioned according to the plans of organised interest in its choosing of ideas and forming of opinions it is hindered either by some punitive force or by the constant insinuation of untruths it is made to dwell in an artificial world of hypnotic phrases
is it merely a transferable commodity
in the old order the king was given to understand that he was the freest individual in the world
in fact the people have become the storehouse of a power that attracts round it a swarm of adventurers who are secretly investing its walls to exploit it for their own devices
in the age of monarchy the king lived surrounded by a miasma of intrigue
a greater semblance of external freedom no doubt he had than other individuals
but this power is robbed by hosts of self seekers and the horse is captured and stabled because of his gift of freedom over space
in the present age intrigue plays a wider part and affects the whole country
the head keeps its place apart from the feet not through some external arrangement or any conspiracy of coercion
have they faith in it
the spirit of freedom
if we have the hardihood to say yes to that question then how can we blame an alien people for subjecting us to a political order which they are tempted to believe eternal
by squeezing human beings in the grip of an inelastic system and forcibly holding them fixed we have ignored the laws of life and growth
have they acquired a true love of freedom
it represents the active aspect of inertia which has the appearance of freedom but not its truth and therefore gives rise to slavery both within its boundaries and outside
it hardened into an age of inert construction
it is the mentality of mutual distrust and fear
he only has freedom who ideally loves freedom himself and is glad to extend it to others
a letter from new york to the authors own countrymen
we boast that in this world no other society but our own has come to finality in the classifying of its living members
but with the ebb of life in india the spirit of creation died away
we have set up an elaborate ceremonial of cage worship and plucked all the feathers from the wings of the living spirit of our people
but have our social divisions the same inevitableness of organic law
the mob mind is allowed the enjoyment of an apparent liberty while its true freedom is curtailed on every side
forgive forgive and hiding his head under the coverlet he lay quivering all over
now it chanced that the story reached the ears of a certain wandering priest who lodged in the next street
but how you managed to escape and are still alive is more than i can understand
thinking i could divine its cause i came to see you and am glad to find i was not mistaken
he would have fled into the house but the ghost stretched forth its withered arm and clutching the back of his neck scowled at him with a vindictive glare and a hideous ghastliness of mien so unspeakably awful that any ordinary man would have swooned with fear
repent therefore and abandon your evil ways
three years ago at the kuana ferry you flung me into the water and well you remember it
when the boatmen and passengers heard the splash and saw the priest struggling in the water they were afraid and made every effort to save him but the wind was fair and the boat running swiftly under the bellying sails so they were soon a few hundred yards off from the drowning man who sank before the boat could be turned to rescue him
here there is an arm of the sea which is crossed in ferry boats that start as soon as some twenty or thirty passengers are gathered together and in one of these boats the two travellers embarked
now alas by this misfortune my cousin is dead and i am left alone
he spoke so feelingly and wept so freely that the passengers believed his story and pitied and tried to comfort him
thus he held forth and tokubei who had long since repented of his crime implored forgiveness and gave him a large sum of money saying half of this is the amount i stole from you three years since the other half i entreat you to accept as interest or as a gift
he who bears a jewel in his bosom bears poison hardly had the ronin heard these words of the priest than an evil heart arose within him and he thought to himself mans life from the womb to the grave is made up of good and of ill luck
be of good cheer now and look me in the face and you will see that i am really a living man and no vengeful goblin come to torment you
haunted by this thought i lost my nerve till one night i beheld your spirit and from that time forth fell ill
you have done a hateful deed but am i not a priest and have i not forsaken the things of this world
about halfway across the priest was taken with a sudden necessity to go to the side of the boat and the ronin following him tripped him up whilst no one was looking and flung him into the sea
what think you gentlemen added he turning to the other travellers
when he saw this the ronin feigned the utmost grief and dismay and said to his fellow passengers this priest whom we have just lost was my cousin he was going to kiyoto to visit the shrine of his patron and as i happened to have business there as well we settled to travel together
seeing he had no ghost to deal with and overwhelmed by the priests kindness tokubei burst into tears and answered indeed indeed i dont know what to say
fortune befriended me ever after but the richer i grew the more keenly i felt how wicked i had been and the more i foresaw that my victims vengeance would some day overtake me
and would it not ill become me to bear malice
we ought by rights to report this matter to the authorities but as i am pressed for time and the business might bring trouble on yourselves as well perhaps we had better hush it up for the present and i will at once go on to kiyoto and tell my cousins patron besides writing home about it
what says the proverb
on my journey homewards i took a lodging in the next street and there heard of your marvellous ailment
since then all has gone well with me yet had i not been poor i had never turned assassin nor thief
happily continued the priest i had learned to swim and to dive as a boy so i reached the shore and after wandering through many provinces succeeded in setting up a bronze figure to buddha thus fulfilling the wish of my heart
to see you do so i should esteem the height of happiness
but the priest far from guessing the drift of his comrades thoughts journeyed cheerfully on till they reached the town of kuana
in a fit of madness i was tempted to kill and rob you
they of course were only too glad to avoid any hindrance to their onward journey and all with one voice agreed to what the ronin had proposed and so the matter was settled
to be sure it seems a shame yet if i could steal the money this priest is boasting about i could live at ease for the rest of my days and so he began casting about how best he might compass his purpose
then the ronin said to the boatmen
but neither pill nor potion could cure tokubei whose strange frenzy soon became the talk of the whole neighbourhood
when death enters a house in japan there are no undertakers to relieve the family of the painful duty of caring for the dead body and placing it in the coffin
these religious ceremonies must be attended to by the mother or wife
thus the old custom is passing away
the house owner then decides whether the day set by the builder is a lucky one for himself and his family
the single exception to this rule about metal is that small copper coins may be put in to fee the old hag who guards the bank of the river of death
visits to noted temples by relatives and friends often result in additions to the childs collection
on the day after the death often in the evening the body must be placed in the cask shaped coffin that until recently was the style commonly in use in japan
no foreigner can hope to do more than dabble in the shallows of it
at an appointed time all the relatives assemble in the death chamber and preparations are made for the bathing of the corpse
in the old days no one thus defiled was allowed to go about his regular business or to mingle with other men but busy modern japan does not find it convenient to pause long in its work so that government officials and school children are now sent written papers excusing them for coming back to their tasks even while ceremonially unclean
each child as it grows toward maturity gathers from various sources a collection of amulets which while worn always when the child is in full dress are frequently too precious for ordinary play times and the risks and perils of every day life
in the case of a person of wealth and influence there will often be a hundred or more of these watchers who must be fed and cared for and who take turns in watching eating and sleeping
if it is not a delay in the building is always preferable to any danger of incurring the displeasure of the luck gods
there is no official ceremonial mourning of parents for their children nor does custom require them to perform any of the last rites or attend the funeral
these utensils must have no metal of any kind about them
to receive these calls the mourners in full ceremonial dress must sit in the death chamber and remove for each guest the covering from the face of the dead
it is their duty to see that the incense burning before the coffin is never allowed to go out while the food for the dead is renewed at regular intervals by the mourners themselves
as the children arrive at years of discretion these treasures pass out of the mothers faithful keeping into the hands of their actual owners and they are usually kept stored away in some little used drawer or cabinet until death removes the necessity for any further safeguards over life
each animal brings its own kind of good or bad luck into the hour day or year over which it presides and only a skillful balancer of pros and cons can read aright the combinations and understand what the luck of any particular hour in any particular day of any particular year will be
on the other hand their bad luck may be counteracted by the good luck of the tiger or hare for as a rule three animals of different portent are presiding over human prospects every hour
there are few enlightened japanese who will defend the present system of cruelty to the afflicted or who do not long for some change but so great is the force of conservatism in this regard so haunting the fear that any change may indicate a lack of respect for the dead that reform advances slowly
a fortune teller is consulted for important things such as removals or marriages but in every day life one cannot be running to a fortune teller about everything and yet there is bad luck lurking in the background that may baffle all our plans if we do not observe the proper times and seasons for our undertakings
but the luck of the rat may be very seriously interfered with by the bad luck of the monkey or of the proverbially unlucky dog when their days and hours occur in the rat year
the dress which must be appropriate to the season in the making of which all the women of the family must assist is the plain straight kimono but must be folded from right to left instead of from left to right as in life
the subject of what to give when to give to whom to give and how to do up the gift acceptably is one the thorough understanding of which requires the study of years
the proper offerings are flowers cake vegetables candles incense or small gifts of money for the purchase of incense
last of all the vacant spaces in the coffin are filled in with bags of tea
through this growing feeling and the unselfishness of maternal affection may come in time the release from these mournful ceremonies
just before the procession starts a religious ceremony is held at the house which is attended by the friends of the deceased and which is substantially the same as that performed at the cemetery
all come who can and those who cannot come send servants or provisions
for instance the rat which is the companion of daikoku the money god is a lucky animal so far as money is concerned
daily offerings must be made before this shrine and reverence paid by the clapping of hands while on feast days special offerings and invocations are required
this somewhat detailed description of the duties to be performed by the members of a bereaved family in the house of mourning is sufficient to show that the presence of death in the home is made as terrible as possible by the painful ceremonies the continual bustle and excitement and the strain upon the resources and executive ability of the housekeeper and her assistants
a person born in the year of the rat will never need money and will be economical possibly miserly and in one born on the day of the rat in the year of the rat these chances and qualities will be doubled
in his will he provided that his body was to be buried without washing in the clothing in which he died
she it is who sets the rice and wine before the ancestral tablets who lights the little lamp each night and who sees that at each feast day and anniversary season the proper food is prepared and set out for the household gods
the visitors then offer the ceremonial bows to the corpse as if it were alive
these little paper packages each marked with the name of the child to whom it belongs are kept by the mother
if the deceased is a person of rank or distinction the house is flooded with cumbersome and useless offerings
these must be kept carefully by the mother as a safeguard against the many evils that beset child life
at the end of this time some acknowledgment must be sent to every friend who has sent anything to the house at the funeral
a case in point is that of the late mr fukuzawa a man whose life was devoted to the advancement of his countrymen in modern ways and who in his death continued his teaching
so far as possible everything in the old house will be packed and ready the day before and very early in the morning the relatives and friends of the mover will begin to rally around him
another favorite present at this time among buddhists is a cage of living birds to be borne to the grave and released thereon
it seems more like a bridal than a burial
as i have already said much of a womans time and thought must be given to the proper distribution of presents among friends and dependents
were not waiting for you now
oh im only a little stiff still
its all settled gentlemen
dont you see that were playing a very ticklish game
never to come back again said ned sharply
and what about you
nothing sir but wait
dont you
did you canter this morning
but the enemy wont be standing still continued griggs
we start to night
lets see were going to have another look at the place this afternoon arent we
but there i dont want to make speeches
finally just at dusk the animals can be driven in for food and water and
weve been patient enough
i should be running fast and dodging in and out among the rocks and trees
griggs is stubborn
weve got something else to think about besides teasing and bantering
but what about the arrows said ned
youre always seeing indians again
any time the doctor likes
they seem to me to be hatching up some dodge or another replied griggs
serve em right if they did sir
oh yes i hear
the indians have shifted their quarters and theyre in about as awkward a position as they could contrive for our purpose
i shouldnt be a bit surprised if we saw them over the way therejust one or two scouting and if we do i should be for a stand at arms all night for it might mean an attack after dark
well you must talk it over with father said chris
theyd have weeks of work before they could get their horses out but without horses theyd be out in a week
every one was busy for the keeping watch regularly took up a good deal of time
were you listening
i dont know about that said chris anxiously
if they do hear anything were done
serve you right
a thrill of excitement ran through chris and his heart began to beat then he was listening so to speak with all his might
had a good turn at scouting
and all seems favourable for our attempt to morrow
yes of course said chris with a dubious look all the same
why
we went at a good swinging gallop
its all nonsense ned cried chris for them to think they are staying on account of ushullo griggs
the plan is to get out of this valley ourselves where we are regularly locked in and to put the redskins in our place locking them in
what for said griggs sharply
here i want for us to be off
well i do
yes sir
im going to take care they dont hit me
canter
there thats enough cried chris
oh
i shall be all right
because it is a very risky thing to do
going to give up young chriss plan said griggs slowly
not quite my lads
no sir
because ive seen indians again
the days glided by with the stiffness in chris lees limbs growing less painful and the pony recovering fast for the clear mountain air seemed to act like a cure for wounds
we must get away from here to some good hunting ground
right i do neighbour and its very handsome of you to offer me the chance to back out
griggs nodded his head
ive just been trying that place again
splendid
i dont like to bother my father any more but what does he say
yes yes but you know what i mean
oh here you are griggs cried the doctor
he says were to start to morrow at daybreak
dont be so petty ned
not a bit of it sir
how did your pony go this morning
too many redskins about as i told you
never been away at all i believe
but we shant my lad
then what do you propose
very well i can do that said ned haughtily
you mean the shutting up the enemy here to starve said bourne
you propose offering yourself for a mark to the indians arrows and
just halted a little on the bad leg but its better than it was yesterday
i have felt something of the kind but i am convinced now that it will not and that we must chance something and make it
i wish we could charge them boldly and send them flying over the plains
we shall get strong more quickly journeying over the plains or climbing in and out among the mountains
theyre an artful lot
but all the same we can be making our preparations
hear that griggs
the indians can wait we cannot and they seem to know it
it takes a deal to starve a redskin
chapter forty nine
nonsense
ive no doubt about it now
hurrah cried chris
provisions can be packed in our wallets in fact everything held ready for a start
not allowed to go off again
theres a bit ive been looking out quite a quarter of a mile farther off and im going to propose it to the doctor as being safest
there he said ive made up my mind
yes my lad but i want them to be planted farther back still
would be if we let them get the better of us sir
exactly replied the doctor
thats right cried griggs
look here if you say that again we shall quarrel
well they showed themselves to me i didnt want them said griggs dryly
look here lads
im not afraid of them hitting me my lad said griggs confidently being shot at by fellows with bows and arrows sounds bad enough but theres not much risk here
why not
besides the family there were many servants and several others walked beside the slow moving wagon
no indeed
the cook too went with them
when i was young like shriya a beggar boy like that would not have dared come so near a noble child the old woman frowned at the little boy who crept meekly back to his cart
everything was done very leisurely though there was a lot of talking and disputing and the giving of contrary orders
poor little woman
oh the thieves he cried
it is a noble brahmin boy and he must be a little prince at the very least whispered mahala to chola in an awestruck voice
there was quite a procession when at last the big wagon rumbled out through the gateway
they did not see the little brahmin again
no country in the world has so many beggars as india
see his rich dresses and the airs he puts on
this was carried by two men one in front and one behind who rested the end of the poles on their shoulders
first there came a big elephant all decorated with silk and gold and silver
the farmer stopped his oxen in the shadefor oxen also do all the ploughingand began to cut some of the long purple stalks of cane
soon when their own pots and pans were got out and the dishes and the bags of rice and meal the cook made ready the supper
as the wagon came up a young man who accompanied the holy man ran up and held out a begging bowl saying give oh charitable people to this holy one cholas mother threw some cakes into the bowl as the wagon stopped
these rug makers are mostly mohammedans a religious sect entirely different from the hindus
it is a rare sight now a days to see one of these white cobras
the next day everybody in the house began to make preparations for the journey
this is more fun than going to school said chola as the oxen plodded along through clouds of dust
the driver sat on the neck of the elephant and guided the big beast by prodding him on one side or the other with an iron shod stick or goad
he and chola were walking beside the wagon for a change
his long matted hair hung on his shoulders and he was saying his prayers with the help of a rosary of beads which he continually passed through his hands
maybe he will pray that our babe be made well and she sighed as she looked down at the white face of the baby in her arms
as they were about to move on again they saw a great cloud of dust down the road
yes and how he orders every one about him
the first thing chola heard when he woke up the next morning was the cook scolding the doves who were picking out of his meal bags while he was getting breakfast ready
behold a pure white cobra cried the farmer
perhaps we can buy some from the man there he is now ploughing by the stream said chola
it may be a sign that the babe will be healed said the mother hopefully when the children came back with their sugar cane and told about the wonderful cobra
it is an elephant and many men said one of the servants
i take them as an offering to the holy river
she felt ashamed of herself for ceasing to play hide and seek with lelechka before fedosya
why asked fedosya with curiosity
but somehow a sense of fear and of sadness crept into her mood and it was humiliating to feel that an absurd tale should disturb her beloved fancies and should agitate her so deeply
her mother covered her with a blue blanket lelechka drew her sweet little hands from under the blanket and stretched them out to embrace her mother
seven
they left the nursery together
serafima aleksandrovna was tormented by presentiments
its the truth im saying remember my words agathya went on with the same assurance and secrecy
she eagerly complied with her mothers new wishes
shell be up in a minute
it was a sad day for serafima aleksandrovna
why does she not get tired of the same thingof eternally closing her eyes and of hiding her face
she did not oppose him
but it was not these charms in lelechka that gave her mother the keenest joy
lelechka was her mothers only child
sergey modestovich was coming at this moment toward the nursery through the half closed doors he heard the laughter the joyous outcries the sound of romping
this charming inability to speak always made serafima aleksandrovna smile with tender rapture
the mother threw herself after the coffin with despairing sobs but she was held back
a smile of absolute bliss played on her red lips
terribly bad
yes thats bad repeated agathya with conviction
he was not after her dowry though it pleased him to know that she had something
this expression of curiosity gave her face the look of a wooden roughly painted doll
lelechka suddenly glanced toward her mothers corner and screamed with joy
serafima aleksandrovna herself began the game once or twice though she played it with a heavy heart
she suffered as though committing an evil deed with full consciousness
that the mistress does it well thats one thing but that the young lady does it thats bad
then they began to talk of something else
he looked handsome and well bred his intelligent grey eyes always preserved a dignified expression and he fulfilled his obligations of a fiance with irreproachable gentleness
she did not wish to hear any further as to the sort of omen it was and what it foreboded
she did not know that she was dying
fedosya motionless with dejected face sat in a corner and looked frightened at her mistress then she suddenly burst out sobbing and she wailed loudly
lelechka was being carried out
she felt cold with her husband
serafima aleksandrovna drifted farther and farther away from him
serafima aleksandrovna hid her face behind the curtains near lelechkas bed
but she soon found that he listened to her without the slightest interest and only from the habit of politeness
go away she said quietly
please speak in a sensible way observed serafima aleksandrovna dryly
what are you saying exclaimed fedosya frightened
lelechka was asleep and serafima aleksandrovna was sitting in her own room thinking with joy and tenderness of lelechka
what is it fedosya she asked with great concern
what nonsense
is it not a germ of the unconscious non desire to live
her mother went to hide
serafima aleksandrovna tried desperately to amuse lelechka
i knew that id find you here he said with a derisive and condescending smile
with these words she fell asleep her face pressing the pillow
lelechka is playing
even fedosya felt abashed now for her mistress now for herself
lelechka was dressed placed in a little coffin and carried into the parlour
one thing sergey modestovich had not become reconciled to and this was his wifes almost continuous presence in the nursery
when serafima aleksandrovna awakened by fedosya came to lelechka and saw her looking so hot so restless and so tormented she instantly recalled the evil omen and a hopeless despair took possession of her from the first moments
she thought to herself the mother is like a little child herselflook how excited she is
the bride was also good looking she was a tall dark eyed dark haired girl somewhat timid but very tactful
the nesletyevs sergey modestovich and serafima aleksandrovna had married without love or calculation because it was the accepted thing
fedosya had a worried frightened look
how tragic
he took his wife by the arm and cautiously led her away from the coffin
you must resign yourself to your fate
lelechka was a delightful child
then she would look out with a sly glance
her mother was growing more absorbed every moment by her interest in the game her heart beat with short quick strokes and she pressed even closer to the wall disarranging her hair still more
if this is so is it not a sign of organic weakness
i dont insist
its the surest sign
you see madam its a kind of omen explained fedosya abruptly in a shamefaced way
she prayed long that night but the prayer did not relieve her sadness
well said fedosya the ludicrous expression of curiosity on her face becoming more emphatic
lelechka then ran away stamping with her plump little legs over the carpets and hid herself behind the curtains near her bed
sergey modestovich went to his wife and consoling her with cold empty words tried to draw her away from the coffin
he was confused and annoyed
i cant tell you how bad it is said fedosya and her face expressed the most decided confidence
why not good asked serafima aleksandrovna with vexation succumbing involuntarily to vague fears
nonsense said serafima aleksandrovna
lelechka was about to fall asleep
where is my baby girl the mother asked as she looked for lelechka and made believe that she did not see her
that was why every movement of lelechkas bewitched her mother
of course i know that gentlefolk dont believe in omens but its a bad omen madam fedosya went on in a doleful voice the young lady will hide and hide
the nurse fedosya a goodnatured and fine looking if somewhat stupid woman smiled as she looked at her mistress with her characteristic expression which seemed to say that it was not for her to object to gentlewomens caprices
fedosyas face made her anxious
who told you all this asked serafima aleksandrovna in an austere low voice
she made a special effort that evening to occupy her mind with other matters but her thoughts returned involuntarily to the fact that lelechka loved to hide herself
and lelechka grew feebler from hour to hour
a doctor was called and everything was done that is usual on such occasionsbut the inevitable happened
her mother looked at her with sad eyes
no sooner had she climbed into her little bed protected by a network on all sides than her eyes began to close from fatigue
though she reproached herself at once for this unfounded superstitious dread nevertheless she could not enter wholeheartedly into the spirit of lelechkas favourite game and she tried to divert lelechkas attention to something else
she saw clearly that there could be no possible connexion between a childs quite ordinary diversion and the continuation of the childs life
hide and seek
nothing made her so unhappy as the reiterations of fedosya uttered between sobs she hid herself and hid herself our lelechka
lelechka is dead she said in a quiet dull voice
fever was consuming lelechka and there were times when she lost consciousness and spoke in delirium
agathya says so madam answered fedosya its she that knows
to tell the truth serafima aleksandrovna felt happy only in the nursery
serafima aleksandrovna upon reflection attributed these womens beliefs in omens to ignorance
he liked coming here where everything was beautifully arranged this was done by serafima aleksandrovna who wished to surround her little girl from her very infancy only with the loveliest things
the mothers heart seemed to stoplelechka lay there so small so frail so quiet
something rattled in her throat lelechka opened and again closed her rapidly paling lips and died
serafima aleksandrovna tried to console herself with the hope that lelechka would get well and would again laugh and playyet this seemed to her an unthinkable happiness
the priest and deacon paced up and down the room clouds of blue smoke drifted in the air and there was a smell of incense
eight
lelechka laughed long and merrily her head close to her mothers knees and all of her cuddled up between her mothers white hands
her mothers eyes glowed with passionate emotion
she went into the nursery and began to walk round the room looking into those places where lelechka used to hide herself
later however when his wife was about to have a child sergey modestovich established connexions elsewhere of a light and temporary nature serafima aleksandrovna found this out and to her own astonishment was not particularly hurt she awaited her infant with a restless anticipation that swallowed every other feeling
agathya listened and shook her head ominously while her face became grave and reproachful
there was no other such child there never had been and there never would be
he entered in the midst of the lively game and he confused them all by his radiant coldness
sergey modestovich gave a swift glance round the room
in any case this is but my humble opinion
lelechka caught cold
i understand nothing of what you are saying
serafima aleksandrovna stood up erect sighed in a lost way smiled and called loudly lelechka
where is my lelechka
madam madam she said quietly in a trembling voice
three days passed torturing like a nightmare lelechka grew quite feeble
this might at the proper opportunity prove useful
sergey modestovich looked anxiously at her pale face
he had connexions and his wife came of good influential people
always irreproachable and tactful nesletyev got on in his position not so fast that any one should envy him nor yet so slow that he should envy any one elseeverything came in the proper measure and at the proper time
he entered the nursery smiling his genial cold smile he was irreproachably dressed and he looked fresh and erect and he spread round him an atmosphere of cleanliness freshness and coldness
she met her husband
but the thoughts of serafima aleksandrovna were confused and she could not quite grasp what was happening
lelechka was getting nearer her mothers corner
he was always fresh and cool with a frigid smile and wherever he passed cold currents seemed to move in the air
sima my dear dont agitate yourself said sergey modestovich in a whisper
when she entered the parlour there were several people between her and lelechka
a little girl was born serafima aleksandrovna gave herself up to her at the beginning she used to tell her husband with rapture of all the joyous details of lekchkas existence
serafima aleksandrovna did not even notice that fedosya came up to her and paused before her
and the mistress herself is like a little one added fedosya smiling
what nonsense
shell be up in a minute persisted serafima aleksandrovna her eyes fixed on the dead little girl
its just as i thought
the little one did not reply
lelechka was quickly carried away from her mother and those who carried her seemed to run rather than to walk
she hid herself and hid herself our lelechka our angelic little soul
sergey modestovich hurried the funeral
perhaps it was because he himself loved the coldhe loved to drink cold water and to breathe cold air
ill think it over his wife answered smiling as he did coldly but genially
lelechka is asleep may god be with her
the fever came upon her at night
she loved her little girl with the ungratified passion that other women deceived in their husbands show their chance young lovers
her mother stood with suppressed breathing her head pressed against the wall her hair somewhat disarranged
she seemed so small and so frail under the blanket that covered her
after their marriage there was nothing in the manner of sergey modestovich to suggest anything wrong to his wife
this would be a miracle and miracles do not happen in the nineteenth century
fedosya dejected her feelings hurt left her mistress
then she put her head out from behind the door and began to laugh
billy blushed
in the den neither billy nor bertram knew or cared what had become of aunt hannah and pete
thats what ailed me all the time i was painting that miserable portrait
then suddenly bertram stirred
billy im going to marry you to morrow he announced decisively
your wedding
the next moment he fell back in amazement before the impetuous rush of a starry eyed flushed cheeked young woman who demanded
next tuesday
it was one matter for her to object to this thing billy was doingbut quite another for pete to do it
as soon as he quoted then scornfully
why billy cried the man in pained surprise
well dearie i dont know yet what you found but i do know you wouldnt have found it at all if it hadnt been for kateand i wish i had her here this minute
but
something in their smiling faces sent a quick suspicion to her eyes
miss billy gasped the old man
it was aunt hannahs plaintive voice at the doorway a little later
i know he is
great scott billy ill have to trust you five days after all
well what is that
and forthwith he began to tell her how much he did indeed need her
well i suppose i might as well own up now as any time
they certainly are
dont want you to get ready retorted bertram promptly
ill get he stopped short with a sudden frown
but dearest what does it meanyou here like this asked bertram then
its next tuesday you see
ill warrant she did
may i ask why
yes a week
a look that was almost terror came to her eyes she pulled herself half away from bertrams encircling arm
i saw marie get ready and i had all i wanted of it
billy giggled hysterically
but billy looked him now straight in the faceit was a level frank gaze of absolute truth
across his face swept such a radiant look of unearthly joy that pete sobbed audibly and fled to the kitchen
hes in the den
bertram
arkwright
im going to marry you to morrow
billy lifted her head
his face was turned toward the door but his eyes were closed
i seei hope
a flying figure brushed by him and fell on its knees by the couch with a low cry
billy on her knees by the couch snuggled into the curve of the one arm with a contented little sigh
where is he pete
there was a long silence then a little breathlessly billy asked
pete told us she broke off wildly beginning to sob
his face was beaming and his old eyes were shining
bertram do youreally
well i can tell you right now billy you will ruin it if you dont declared bertram
that was what they were afraid of at firstthat id lose my arm but that danger is all past now
billy laughed softly
but thats only a week away gasped aunt hannah
lose me
yes i know that is a good while cut in bertram airily
billy rose at once as aunt hannah entered the room
pete where is he interposed billy
dont you know kate by this time
sweetheart see here dear he cried softly tightening his good left arm
i was scared blue billy with jealousy ofarkwright
as if to make sure that she was here like this he drew her even closerbertram was so thankful that he did have one arm that was usable
you mean itll be beforeoctober aunt hannah glanced from one to the other uncertainly
i wonder if you think i can get ready to be married in five days
i found it everywhere afterwardsin magazines and papers and even in marie
five days indeed sir
billy laughed
well no exploded bertram
this time it was aunt hannah who gasped her name
well bertrams voice was a little strained
oh im so glad you came
dong ling found him there a minute later polishing a silver teaspoon with a fringed napkin that had been spread over bertrams tray
and you dontafter all love mejust to paint
he had not been slow to mark that swift lowering of her eyelids
whatever angels do young women dont go unannounced and unchaperoned into young mens rooms
well i am
good heavens
bertram kissed the finger and subsided
aunt hannahs cheeks too were flushed and her eyes starry but with dismay and angerthe last because she did not like the way pete had said miss billys name
there was another silence
of course its she retorted aunt hannah testily
theres a new law about the license
thank god for that breathed bertram as he drew the bright head nearer and held it close
nonsense she cried
itll be all right nowall right
then he saw aunt hannahaunt hannah with her bonnet askew her neck bow awry one hand bare and the other half covered with a glove wrong side out
when you were so troubled that the picture didnt go well and i found out it was about me you were troubledi
i forgot
why hes going to marry alice greggory
arent lovers the beatem for imagining things she murmured
pete told you that i didnt care for any girl only to paint demanded bertram angry and mystified
well whos doing the marryingshe or i thats what i said tooonly in another way sighed billy
opposite the door on a low couch lay bertram his head bandaged and his right arm in a sling
do you mean to say you really
in the hall above aunt hannah was crying into williams gray linen duster that hung on the hall rackaunt hannahs handkerchief was on the floor back at hillside
billy my dear
i was so worriedfor fear id lose you
billys eyes widened a little
billy stop
mr bertram is up and dressed maam
and you never did think for a minute billy that you cared for him bertrams gaze searched billys face a little fearfully
mr bertram began petebut he got no further
confound that law
i can see it as plain as day in her letters hes there a lot
ill speak to him
if you really must have all those miles of tablecloths and napkins and doilies and lace rufflings well do it afterwardsnot before
billy lifted her head and sat back in palpitating dismay
but bertram what she wrote was true
with stiffly pompous dignity pete opened the door
it was all the others that told me that
great scott billy
pete had recovered himself by now but he did not even glance toward aunt hannah
you seei wasnt in love with mr arkwright
miss billy miss billy youre an angel straight from heaven you areyou are
as if you yourself didnt bring her here with your crazy messages at this time of night
there there dear comforted bertram patting the bronze gold head on his breast
hes in the den miss billy
what an absurd idea
the tender glow on billys face told its own story and bertrams eager eyes were not slow to read it
billy laughed gaylybut she shifted her position and did not meet her lovers eyes
the emphatic we and us were not lost on him but his face was preternaturally grave when he spoke
well to begin with kate said
yes aunt hannah ill come besidesshe glanced at bertram mischievouslyi shall need all the time ive got to prepare formy wedding
we must go home and william is here too and wants to see you
that was bertram stopped suddenly
a shamed red crept to the mans forehead
yes nodded billy demurely
well she wrote a letter
pete once again the punctilious butler stalked to the door of bertrams den and threw it wide open
bertrams eyes flew open
petes lips twitched
why bertram dear dont you see
im loads better
billy turned eagerly but before she could take so much as one step toward the door at the end of the hall aunt hannahs indignant voice arrested her
as for my not painting againyou didnt understand pete dearie
tell mr bertram i am hereor wait
you darling
billy put a soft finger on his lips
is that kate too demanded bertram grimly
more than a hundred professing christian disciples had failed to go to the polls and many more than that number had voted with the whiskey men
under the circumstances i have a great distaste for what seems like display at such times
i feel as you do replied mr maxwell
only this was with a different attitude
so that is how it happened that monday afternoon at the tent the funeral service of loreen was held before an immense audience that choked the tent and overflowed beyond all previous bounds
raymond of course being a railroad town and the centre of the great packing interests for this region is full of saloons
if all the church members of raymond had voted against the saloon it would today be outlawed instead of crowned king of the municipality
the thought that the christian conscience had been aroused too late or too feebly lay with a weight of accusation upon the heart of the editor
i am sure that whatever you and miss page think best will be right
the rumor at the rectangle that the second and third wards had gone no license proved to be false
the body of loreen lay in state at the page mansion on the avenue it was sunday morning and the clear sweet spring air just beginning to breathe over the city the perfume of early blossoms in the woods and fields swept over the casket from one of the open windows at the end of the grand hall
for raymond had awakened that morning to the fact that the city had gone for license after all
every one in the rectangle knew that loreen was at this moment lying in the page mansion up on the avenue exaggerated reports of the magnificence of the casket had already furnished material for eager gossip
would it be public
yes said virginia
the evangelist a man of apparently very simple unassuming style spoke a few words and he was followed by a fine looking man the rev
but the result was the same as if it had been overwhelming
the rectangle was excited to know the details of the funeral
he heard of the contemplated service at the tent and went down
it was a meeting full of broken prayers of contrition of confession of strong yearning for a new and better city life
i cannot describe the effect of that singing
i think the most christian thing will be to let them have the service at the tent
john gray down in the slum district known as the rectangle
that of course is not so strange an effect to be produced at a funeral service but the voice itself was one of thousands
i do not know but that some time i shall know she gave her life for mine
the occasion was caused by the killing of a woman during an election riot last saturday night
and all through it ran one general cry for deliverance from the saloon and its awful curse
let her friends be allowed the gratification of their wishes
there was a very unique and unusual funeral service held here this afternoon at the tent of an evangelist rev
then followed what was perhaps the queer part of this strange service
i caught from the ministers remarks that he had only recently changed his views in regard to license
no man had given or suffered more to influence public opinion that week than norman
the service aside from the singing was peculiar
what do you think mr maxwell
when had the first church yielded to such a baptism of tears
the rectangle had never before mingled even in this distant personal manner with the aristocracy on the boulevard the opportunities for doing so were not frequent
do you think so miss virginia
for her acquaintance was large and many of the recent converts were among her friends
so the arrangements were made with some difficulty for the service at the tent and virginia with her uncle and rollin accompanied by maxwell rachel and president marsh and the quartet from the first church went down and witnessed one of the strange things of their lives
gray and his wife were besieged by inquirers who wanted to know what loreens friends and acquaintances were expected to do in paying their last respects to her
i will be guided by your judgment in the matter
the meeting was tender it glowed with the spirits presence it was alive with strong and lasting resolve to begin a war on the whiskey power in raymond that would break its reign forever
today the entire force of the gathering seemed to be directed to this one large purpose
not a man sang a note
what did miss page intend to do
a fragment of his account belongs to this part of the history of raymond
henry maxwell pastor of the first church of raymond
they had been living so long on their surface feelings that they had almost forgotten the deeper wells of life
who could tell what might have been accomplished by this time
all the time the singing continued softly like rain on a tent cover when the wind is gentle
we certainly cannot and will not use the occasion for vulgar display
for that had been the fact in raymond for years
poor soul
the saloon ruled
it was one of the simplest and at the same time one of the most impressive sights i ever witnessed
gray had gone up to virginias and after talking it over with her and maxwell the arrangement had been made
he certainly made a very striking address and yet it was in no sense inappropriate for a funeral
no one denied that
she will probably be heard from soon
but when the congregation had finally gone and he had entered the lecture room it needed but a glance to show him that the original company of followers had been largely increased
but the most remarkable part of the music was a solo sung by a strikingly beautiful young woman a miss winslow who if i remember right is the young singer who was sought for by crandall the manager of national opera and who for some reason refused to accept his offer to go on the stage
the women in the tent at least a large part of them up near the coffin began to sing in a soft tearful way i was a wandering sheep then while the singing was going on one row of women stood up and walked slowly past the casket and as they went by each one placed a flower of some kind upon it
it was true that the victory was won by a very meager majority
it seems she had been recently converted during the evangelists meetings and was killed while returning from one of the meetings in company with other converts and some of her friends
and this woman who had been brutally struck down by the very hand that had assisted so eagerly to work her earthly ruin what of her
then they sat down and another row filed past leaving their flowers
but if the first church was deeply stirred by the events of the last week the rectangle also felt moved strangely in its own way
what if he had begun to do as jesus would have done long ago
she was a common street drunkard and yet the services at the tent were as impressive as any i ever witnessed in a metropolitan church over the most distinguished citizen
and all through his impassioned appeal this morning there was a note of sadness and rebuke and stern condemnation that made many of the members pale with self accusation or with inward anger
i understand miss winslow sings in the first church of raymond and could probably command almost any salary as a public singer
the christians of raymond stood condemned by the result
the church bells were ringing and people on the avenue going by to service turned curious inquiring looks up at the great house and then went on talking of the recent events which had so strangely entered into and made history in the city
all this with a voice that rang and trembled and broke in sobs of anguish for the result did henry maxwell pour out upon his people that sunday morning
such a voice could win its way anywhere
since the first sunday when the first company of volunteers had pledged themselves to do as jesus would do the different meetings had been characterized by distinct impulses or impressions
the people at the rectangle will not come here to service
what had become of its regular precise conventional order of service undisturbed by any vulgar emotion and unmoved by any foolish excitement
raymond had voted to continue for another year the saloon
i am and always have been opposed to large public funerals said gray whose complete wholesome simplicity of character was one of its great sources of strength but the cry of the poor creatures who knew loreen is so earnest that i do not know how to refuse this desire to see her and pay her poor body some last little honor
over the church in the silence that followed this strange scene sobs and the noise of weeping arose
and men and women wept as he spoke
she had a most wonderful manner in singing and everybody was weeping before she had sung a dozen words
in the first place a most exquisite anthem was sung by a trained choir
mr maxwell did not ask this morning for volunteers to join those who had already pledged to do as jesus would
what would jesus do
but this seems different
at the first church mr maxwell bearing on his face marks of the scene he had been through confronted an immense congregation and spoke to it with a passion and a power that came so naturally out of the profound experiences of the day before that his people felt for him something of the old feeling of pride they once had in his dramatic delivery
i dont want any dinner said charlotte drawing back
its my right pickering you have no father to see to you and ive always wanted to have the best success be yours he turned away his head now a break coming in his voice
sure as i can be phronsie said old mr king smiling
there thats it patting charlottes head with both hands now you look very nice you really dodoesnt she polly
but it was no use and mr king caught her in time to see the quick drops roll down phronsies cheek and to feel them fall on his hand
i dont see pickering he resumed why you shouldnt get along youre through college
felicia a cabot
good by dear
ive been a lazy dog all my life and a good for naught but i hope ive not sunk to that
i couldnt still said phronsie and it looked as if the shower were about to fall again
but what of that child pray
for heavens sake pickering cried his uncle darting in front of the chair and its restless occupant dont say that again
and after this there were no more quiet days for charlotte chatterton everybody who was musical wanted to revel in her voice and everybody who wasnt wanted the same thing because it was so talked about
i heard it raging up and down
but first child tell me what it is and he stroked her yellow hair
the very thing exclaimed jasper with only a thought for pollys pleasure when polly had cried how nice of mrs cabot dont you say so father he added
dont grandpapa dont she caught him around the neck imploringly
not worth it either he added relapsing into his gloom then he shoved his chair so that he could not look his uncle in the face and bent a steady glance out of the window
it would be so nice to have charlotte have some with me
it really does grandpapa
does it make you sorry grandpapa dear to have me want charlotte to have the money with me she asked timidly
then she spoke again
come in called the old gentleman come in
i know child you think your old grandpapa does just about right said mr king soothingly and highly gratified
oh i do so wish i might she said theres so much for a little girl like me
indeed you are not pickering cried mr cabot quickly the color rising to his cheek
im not going to lecture you my boy said mr cabot closing the door then going to the mantel to lean one elbow on it a favorite attitude of his while he scanned his nephew
why isnt the money my very own grandpapa
bless you child cried the old gentleman much moved i wish i could say i believed what you say
wouldnt it make her very glad if i gave charlotte some of the money phronsies red lips were very close to his ear now oh i do want to so much you cant think grandpapa how much
then she sat down on the top step and clasped her hands
now then phronsie you are never going to be too big you know to sit on my knee so hop up now
i wont grandpapa said phronsie obediently and patting his broad back with her soft hand
maybe said the old gentleman with a short laugh and i shouldnt wonder if cousin eunice was sorry over a few other things too phronsie
assuredly said old mr king with great satisfaction in pollys pleasure and at her success in drawing charlotte out
grandpapa asked phronsie suddenly how much money did mrs chatterton say i was to have
let me smooth your hair begged phronsie standing on tiptoe do bend down just a very little please
if mrs chatterton was aunt to charlotte persisted phronsie slowly it seems as if charlotte ought to have some of the money
do dear polly run over to morrow morning early
oh dont begged charlotte looking over at polly
dear me pickering taking off his eyeglasses to blow his nose you neednt pick me up so violently ive been much worried about you settling his glasses again for another look at his nephew
two red spots burned on her cheeks and her pale blue eyes snapped
but cousin eunice didnt think so else shed have left it to charlotte said mr king abruptly and she did choose to leave it to you
why what makes you ask such a question
oh no grandpapa cried phronsie in a rapture i could never be too big for that so she perched up as of old on his knee then she folded her hands and looked gravely in his face
well i wont child promised mr king holding her close
it ran thus
phronsie stood a moment quite still where he left her then she ran up to him and slipped her hand within his
so theres an end of it phronsie
but when she saw polly she said im sorry i frightened you but im best alone
oh nothing nothingim sure i didnt mean cried mr cabot starting back suddenly in astonishment
still no answer
polly is looking out for that
no no child answered mr king hastily and yet i dont know what to say
i didnt mean youd really blame me only
its the best law firm in the town pickering mr cabot brought his elbow off from the mantel enough to smite his palms together smartly in enthusiasm
but many things in my life might have been bettered
see here pickering mr cabot threw wide the door of his private office with a nervous hand
i didnt want you to have it but the thing was fixed and i couldnt help myself
but come in come in he laid hold of pickerings arm and gently forced him into the little room
grandpapa said phronsie wasnt mrs chatterton aunt to charlotte
well what is it uncle
i got you in there
i did really charlotte
and i believe i am going to the dogs
it shall be just a secret between you and me
i do believe something is in the room with charlotte she said as polly came running up the stairs
and neither can we do anything now but take matters as they are
and then he thought no more about it and the bell ringing and mr alstyne coming in he went off into the library for a quiet chat
polly is making her have beautiful times said phronsie happily oh very beautiful times indeed grandpapa
no no dont ask me ejaculated pickering striking his knee with one glove and turning apprehensively in his chair
but something worse than common has come to you
you are sure you wont make your head ache thinking about it grandpapa she asked anxiously
charlotte flung wide the door
do out with it im in no mood for a lecture though this morning
well i cant say but that i was a good deal disturbed at one time said mr cabot frankly but never mind that now you are through and he heaved a sigh of relief and nicely established with van metre and cartwright
there they are coming after us as quick footsteps sounded in the hall below hurry charlotte do
not to be ungracious the young man threw himself into a chair
i do think said phronsie without taking her eyes from his face that maybe mrs chatterton is sorry now and wishes that she had left some money to charlotte
you may do anything you like dear there mopping up her wet little face with his handkerchief now thats a good child phronsie you are not going to cry of course not there do smile a bit thats my girl now as a faint light stole into phronsies eyes
and i cant tolerate any thoughts i cannot speak
come in i never get one nowadays
oh no grandpapa protested phronsie in a tone of horror they couldnt have been better
indeed but you must come down said polly firmly holding out her hand
so she was asked to sing at musicales and receptions without end until alexia exclaimed at last they are all raving stark mad over her and its all pollys own fault the whole of it
oh bless me exclaimed mr king with a start
blame you
well then phronsie if you want it i suppose it must be said mr king quite as a matter of course
ive seen this thing whatever it is coming upon you for sometime said mr cabot too nervous to notice the entreaty in pickerings voice and manner and i cannot wait any longer to find out the trouble
so you did dear said mr king highly gratified and pushing away his writing table he held out his hand
there there my sisters boy shall never say that
which is a wonder interpolated pickering
oh hang it uncle why cant you let me alone
really you must else i am afraid grandpapa will be up here after you
dont you suppose so grandpapa and one hand stole up to his neck
for answer mr king set her down hastily on the floor and took two or three turns up and down the room
cant stop uncle said pickering hastily
i was writing a note to mrs fargo said phronsie putting up her lips for a kiss
why grandpapa i couldnt phronsie drew a long breath then threw herself convulsively into his arms her face working hard in her efforts not to cry
i expect shes an awful nuisance the old gentleman broke out suddenly
yes grandpapa said phronsie coming in and shutting the door carefully i came on purpose to see you all alone
can i help in any way
but when he was there he felt so much worse that he soon got back into the old position
what have you got into your head phronsie
but well now phronsie you run back to your play child and ill set to work at once to think out this matter
oh grandpapa exclaimed phronsie breaking away from him to look into his face
i dont feel that it would be right for you to give any of your money to her
i want to consult you in regard to asking miss chatterton to sing at my next at home i should be charmed to have her favor us
oh grandpapa exclaimed phronsie in gentle reproach and standing very tall
right cried phronsie opening her brown eyes very wide
yes indeed said polly cheerily just as fine as can be
what have you been doing lately do you gamble
charlotte poor repeated the old gentleman
its enough to make a man go to the bad to lose hope
oh bless me its you phronsie in pleased surprise
yes yes of course but you are too young to judge of such things said the old gentleman decidedly as the giving away of property and all that
what do you take me for demanded pickering starting to his feet with flashing eyes and throwing open his top coat as if the weight oppressed him
besides what would be the use you never see anything encouraging about me or my career
oh she left you everything she had phronsie a couple of millions or so it is why
well my dear what is it asked the old gentleman presently youve come to tell me something i suppose
come charlotte
were coming boys she called
yes that is to charlottes father corrected mr king
grandpapa asked phronsie looking intently at him isnt charlotte very very poor
come down to dinner charlotte said polly quickly
phronsie laid down the note she was writing to mrs fargo a fortnight later and said to herself i would better do it now i think and going out she went deliberately to old mr kings room and rapped at the door
and meantime said mr king quite satisfied why charlotte is having pretty good times i think
that was i said charlotte i was the wild beast phronsie
they had just finished dinner when a note was handed polly
william to the great amazement of the dealer flung a guinea in the center pot which was immediately tapped by jack while the others looked on in silent expectation
william frantically said
quick as a flash william replied i know more than those who know less and know less than those who know more
the devils tavern was a resort for actors authors bohemians lords and ladies who did not retire early to their downy couches
if he had dropped out of the clouds william could not have been more pleased or surprised and the feeling was reciprocal
this was one of the finest homes in the city of that period and its acquisition was a premonitory sign of the surrender of the famous residential avenue to commerce
i still sold them for forty cents and lost more money that year than any other because the sales were increasing rapidly
chapter fifteen
edison marginalized documents extensively
he was discharged whereupon the union notified us that unless the boy was taken back the whole body would go out
the routine was very much the same as that at the laboratory in its utter neglect of the clock
for making the dynamos edison secured as noted in the preceding chapter the roach iron works on goerck street new york and this was also equipped
this was one of the big box houses on upper fifth avenue
in the second place the coming of the incandescent light raised the standard of illumination in such a manner that more gas than ever was wanted in order to satisfy the popular demand for brightness and brilliancy both indoors and on the street
it was not a fact at any time that the public was opposed to the idea of the electric light
as a matter of fact such work began in advance of almost every other kind
that made the tammany man all safe
the first year eighteen eighty one was naturally that which witnessed the greatest rush of visitors and the building hardly ever closed its doors till midnight
i would talk for the benefit of his music
the houses afterward went onto the new york edison system
i had caused a printers composing case to be set up with the idea that if we could get editors and publishers in to see it we should show them the advantages of the electric light
i had nothing on to protect me against the cold
so much for the early opposition of which there was plenty
twombly closed the contract with us for a plant
even if i locked them up in my desk they would break it open
i did whatever he told me and looked after all kinds of affairs from buying his clothes to financing his business
i remember as a coincidence that the building was only twenty feet wide
we moved the lamp works from menlo park to harrison
speaking of telling stories i once got telling a man stories at the harrison lamp factory in the yard as he was leaving
the way of the inventor is hard
the important question had arisen therefore of satisfying the fire underwriters as to the safety of the system
the other man could not and so we let him out
after that every time he came to new york he used to call at sixty five late at night with his violin
i was too busy on other things to notice
the process is heroic but costly
mr herter was doing the decoration and it was extraordinarily fine
in two distinct directions the gas art was immediately helped by edisons work
i thought no more about the matter
they were not only more surly they were diminishing the output and it became impossible to manage the works
he was good company
introduction of the edison electric light
there also the most bitter feeling was shown
he gave us permissiontold us to go ahead and he would see it was all right
after feeling around for some days i got a clew how to do it
we sold them for forty cents but there were only about twenty or thirty thousand of them
finally i opened the pedestala storehouse for tools etc
no not doubts as to religion not the slightest injury to that he paused
no said margaret sadly i will do it
frederick must not suffer said margaret decidedly in a foreign country so unjustly treated by his own
listen dear margaret said he putting one arm round her waist
a soul that desires to serve and honour him shall never want opportunity to do it nor must thou so limit the holy one of israel as to think he hath but one way in which he can glorify himself by thee
margaret sighed as if standing on the verge of some new horror he began again speaking rapidly as if to get over a set task
mr hale shook his head despondingly he pressed her hand in token of gratitude
but father said she suddenly lifting up her flushed tear wet face the early martyrs suffered for the truth while youoh
as her fingers were on the handle he called her back
she forgot that he had not made them an offer
i am going to leave helstone
you cannot mean that you are really going to leave the churchto give up helstoneto be for ever separate from me from mammaled away by some delusionsome temptation
in a fortnight
he was gone
would you dislike breaking it to her very much margaret
bread for your family
surely if the bishop were told all we know about frederick and the hard unjust
a hundred is left
god forgive me
what was to be done
at last he said
do tell me
it would be different
what could he mean
your poor mothers fond wish gratified at last in the mocking way in which over fond wishes are too often fulfilledsodom apples as they arehas brought on this crisis for which i ought to be and i hope i am thankful
but why
margaret was preparing her mothers worsted work and rather shrinking from the thought of the long evening and wishing bed time were come that she might go over the events of the day again
margaret went up to dress for the early tea finding dixon in a pretty temper from the interruption which a visitor had naturally occasioned on a busy day
i think i could do anything but that the idea of her distress turns me sick with dread
his trials are over
margaret i tried to do it i tried to content myself with simply refusing the additional preferment and stopping quietly herestrangling my conscience now as i had strained it before
no said mr hale that would not answer
yes said he in the same despondent indifferent way
you and mamma have some money independent of the income from the living have not you
thou wilt have little thanks o my soul
was it to be so sudden then
margaret was nearly upset again into a burst of crying
he swallowed down the dry choking sobs which had been heaving up from his heart hitherto and going to his bookcase he took down a volume which he had often been reading lately and from which he thought he had derived strength to enter upon the course in which he was now embarked
oh it seems so terrible so shocking said margaret suddenly bursting into tears
margaret resolved to keep silence
well i had reason to suspectto imaginei had better say nothing about it however
i do not know exactly
and it is owing to him we are going to milton
mr hale sat in rigid stillness while she spoke
he has lived an easy life in his college all his days
mr hale continued a few months ago when my misery of doubt became more than i could bear without speaking i wrote to mr bellyou remember mr bell margaret
margaret i return to the old sad burden we must leave helstone
i think we could
you must have many painful things to do
i mean can you leave it and come into my study
oh if i were not marriedif i were but myself in the world how easy it would be
they make me so undecided
as he read this and glanced at much more which he did not read he gained resolution for himself and felt as if he too could be brave and firm in doing what he believed to be right but as he ceased he heard margarets low convulsive sob and his courage sank down under the keen sense of suffering
the house was shut up for the evening
i cannot bear to give pain
it is that that is the great perplexity
i dont know that he gave me much strength
her mother came into the room before this whirl of thoughts was adjusted into anything like order
at any rate he has property there which has very much increased in value since milton has become such a large manufacturing town
at any rate there is an opening as i have said for a private tutor
margaret i am a poor coward after all
nothing is fixed said her father with anxious hesitation as he noticed the filmy sorrow that came over her eyes and the sudden change in her complexion
margaret was almost stunned
yes papa it had better be fixed soon and decidedly as you say
then he read aloud
yes
poor maria replied mr hale tenderly
but when
you could not understand it all if i told youmy anxiety for years past to know whether i had any right to hold my livingmy efforts to quench my smouldering doubts by the authority of the church
frederick was an outlaw
margaret did dislike it did shrink from it more than from anything she had ever had to do in her life before
i wanted to talk it over with you
he is a fellow of plymouth college there
i shall have to take my deed of resignation and wait upon the bishop myself to bid him farewell
when god will not use thee in one kind yet he will in another
oh
margaret i will tell you about it
but i felt sure of sympathy from mr bell
if i tell you all perhaps you could break it to her to morrow
she sat by herself at the fire with unlighted candles on the table behind her thinking over the day the happy walk happy sketching cheerful pleasant dinner and the uncomfortable miserable walk in the garden
margaret said mr hale at last in a sort of sudden desperate way that made her start
i have borne long with self reproach that would have roused any mind less torpid and cowardly than mine he shook his head as he went on
she showed it by brushing away viciously at margarets hair under pretence of being in a great hurry to go to mrs hale
yes
but she recovered herself immediately
it is not a month since the bishop offered me another living if i had accepted it i should have had to make a fresh declaration of conformity to the liturgy at my institution
he rose and walked up and down the room speaking low words of self reproach and humiliation of which margaret was thankful to hear but few
at length he stopped and replied
to her surprise her father began to walk about again before he answered
i cannot stand objections
you see your mother knows nothing about it yet but i think in a fortnightafter my deed of resignation is sent in i shall have no right to remain
i will answer any questions this once but after to night let us never speak of it again
the one staid foundation of her home of her idea of her beloved father seemed reeling and rocking
i can meet the consequences of my painful miserable doubts but it is an effort beyond me to speak of what has caused me so much suffering
because there i can earn bread for my family
milton northern
seventy of that has always gone to frederick since he has been abroad
besides in a country parish i should be so painfully reminded of helstone and my duties here
he will come to stay with us to morrow
could he have become implicated in anything frederick had done
margaret was almost overpowered with the idea that her mother knew nothing of it all and yet the affair was so far advanced
no we must go to milton
thought margaret and yet perhaps it was as well
then she took it into her head that after all his lightness might be but assumed to cover a bitterness of disappointment which would have been stamped on her own heart if she had loved and been rejected
it is all myself
but nothing to the shock she received from mr hales last speech
he made her take a chair by him he stirred the fire snuffed the candles and sighed once or twice before he could make up his mind to sayand it came out with a jerk after allmargaret
margaret could not bear the sight of the suspense which was even more distressing to her father than to herself
margaret had imagined nothing less than that some of the preferments which her mother so much desired had befallen her father at lastsomething that would force him to leave beautiful beloved helstone and perhaps compel him to go and live in some of the stately and silent closes which margaret had seen from time to time in cathedral towns
the manufacturing town in darkshire
i dont know if he wants it all he continued in a hesitating manner
there is a curate appointed to read prayersa mr brown
why can you no longer be a clergyman
yes
some want their children to be better instructed than they themselves have been
yet after all margaret had to wait a long time in the drawing room before her mother came down
how different men were to women
i must do something
then she arose and went without another word or look towards the door
leave helstone papa
when do we go asked margaret after a short silence
discordant as it waswith almost a detestation for all she had ever heard of the north of england the manufacturers the people the wild and bleak countrythere was this one recommendationit would be different from helstone and could never remind them of that beloved place
because i must no longer be a minister in the church of england
no i never saw him i think
only help me to tell your mother
fredericks godfatheryour old tutor at oxford dont you mean
you shall be told all margaret
i see
i could not bear it margaret
what could she say
is that tapestry thing of immediate consequence
there now what is it
now then what did you do to your hair
she says she thinks it will be very becoming
dyed your hair
i used up the whole bottle and oh marilla when i saw the dreadful color it turned my hair i repented of being wicked i can tell you
i have proof nowgreen hair is proof enough for anybody
oh marilla what shall i do questioned anne in tears
how could i doubt his word marilla
i dont believe in encouraging them to come around at all
annes clipped head made a sensation in school on the following monday but to her relief nobody guessed the real reason for it not even josie pye who however did not fail to inform anne that she looked like a perfect scarecrow
shes not here when i told her to stay retorted marilla
it seems such a tragic thing
this is such an unromantic affliction
she may be bright and sweet enough but her head is full of nonsense and theres never any knowing what shape itll break out in next
you cant go out with it looking like that
i think the peddler had a very kind heart for he said that seeing it was me hed sell it for fifty cents and that was just giving it away
it certainly had a very strange appearance
oh marilla you little know how utterly wretched i am
the spring was abroad in the land and marillas sober middle aged step was lighter and swifter because of its deep primal gladness
but im bringing her up not you
please marilla go away and dont look at me
ill have to see a doctor about them
but there
my career is closed
oh marilla what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive that is poetry but it is true
people have pretty well forgotten my other mistakesthe liniment cake and setting diana drunk and flying into a temper with mrs lynde
accordingly anne washed her hair scrubbing it vigorously with soap and water but for all the difference it made she might as well have been scouring its original red
dyed it
never in all her life had marilla seen anything so grotesque as annes hair at that moment
goodness knows whats to be done
it makes you feel very virtuous when you forgive people doesnt it
in a trice i saw myself with beautiful raven black hair and the temptation was irresistible
i didnt say anything when josie said that to me anne confided that evening to marilla who was lying on the sofa after one of her headaches because i thought it was part of my punishment and i ought to bear it patiently
lighting it she turned around to see anne herself lying on the bed face downward among the pillows
marilla i cannot face josie pye
but there is nothing comforting in having your hair cut off because youve dyed it a dreadful color is there
but theyll never forget this
with a dismal sigh she went for the scissors
of course i knew youd take her part matthew
what have you done
yes i will too
im in the depths of despair and i dont care who gets head in class or writes the best composition or sings in the sunday school choir any more
the peddler said it was warranted to dye any hair a beautiful raven black and wouldnt wash off
why its green
i mean to devote all my energies to being good after this and i shall never try to be beautiful again
i reckon shell find it hard to explain that to my satisfaction
perhaps youre judging her too hasty marilla
who said
i can never live this down
at the end of the week marilla said decidedly
no
but im bringing her up and not rachel lynde whod pick faults in the angel gabriel himself if he lived in avonlea
he spoke so feelingly about them that it touched my heart
i know what it feels like to have your word doubted
but please marilla go away and dont look at me
the peddler that was here this afternoon
but i thought it was worth while to be a little wicked to get rid of red hair
during that time she went nowhere and shampooed her hair every day
vanity and vexation of spirit
oh i didnt let him in the house
i must say with all her faults i never found her disobedient or untrustworthy before and im real sorry to find her so now
get right up this minute and tell me
annes unhappiness continued for a week
im going to weep all the time youre cutting it off if it wont interfere
i never thought i was vain about my hair of all things but now i know i was in spite of its being red because it was so long and thick and curly
marilla was not given to subjective analysis of her thoughts and feelings
oh i feel that my heart is broken
and ive been repenting ever since
i counted the cost marilla
are you sick then demanded marilla anxiously going over to the bed
consequently when marilla entered her kitchen and found the fire black out with no sign of anne anywhere she felt justly disappointed and irritated
i am the unhappiest girl in prince edward island
i dyed it
this minute i say
my head is better now
here i am saying the very thing i was so riled with rachel lynde for saying at the aid today
come right down to the kitchenits too cold up hereand tell me just what youve done
it was dark when supper was ready and still no sign of anne coming hurriedly over the log bridge or up lovers lane breathless and repentant with a sense of neglected duties
i wanted to buy something from him to help him in such a worthy object
it was terrible bad this afternoon though these headaches of mine are getting worse and worse
you havent got into any scrape for over two months and i was sure another one was due
i dont care if mrs allan does say shes the brightest and sweetest child she ever knew
no was the muffled reply
chapter twenty seven
of course its better to be good
then all at once i saw the bottle of hair dye
besides i meant to be extra good in other ways to make up for it
does it hurt your head
i will call it a snoodthat sounds so romantic
i thought nothing could be as bad as red hair
ill settle miss anne when she comes home said marilla grimly as she shaved up kindlings with a carving knife and with more vim than was strictly necessary
i wouldnt have dyed it green
they will think i am not respectable
ill never never look at myself again until my hair grows she exclaimed passionately
look at my hair marilla she whispered
and i wont try to imagine it away either
little things like that are of no importance now because i dont suppose ill ever be able to go anywhere again
and oh how josie pye will laugh
annes lips quivered but she realized the bitter truth of marillas remarks
marilla washed and put away the dishes grimly
i do really want to be good marilla like you and mrs allan and miss stacy and grow up to be a credit to you
your hair must be cut off there is no other way
marilla had done her work thoroughly and it had been necessary to shingle the hair as closely as possible the result was not becoming to state the case as mildly as may be
perhaps after a while ill get used to it but im afraid concerts spoil people for everyday life
i can scarcely realize that im in my teens
but im glad miss barry liked them
it makes life seem so much more interesting in two more years ill be really grown up
miss josephine barry wrote back that she had never read anything so amusing in her life
if i had alice bells crooked nose said anne decidedly i wouldntbut there
to be sure the concert left traces
they were buried in the one grave and their funeral was most imposing diana
she puts too much lovemaking into her stories and you know too much is worse than too little
but im afraid that is an uncharitable speech
all the good people are rewarded and all the bad ones are suitably punished
mrs lynde says it is
janes stories are extremely sensible then diana puts too many murders into hers
eventually however avonlea school slipped back into its old groove and took up its old interests
none of the sloanes would have any dealings with the bells because the bells had declared that the sloanes had too much to do in the program and the sloanes had retorted that the bells were not capable of doing the little they had to do properly
i feel just now that i may grow up to be sensible yet
the story club is formed
jane and ruby almost always cry when i come to the pathetic parts
chapter twenty six
oh diana look theres a rabbit
its called the jealous rival or in death not divided i read it to marilla and she said it was stuff and nonsense
youve been thirteen for a month so i suppose it doesnt seem such a novelty to you as it does to me
its a sad sweet story
the winter weeks slipped by
it would be if youd only cultivate it said anne cheeringly
i suppose that is why marilla disapproves of them marilla is such a sensible woman
mr allan says so
josie pye and julia bell did not speak for three months because josie pye had told bessie wright that julia bells bow when she got up to recite made her think of a chicken jerking its head and bessie told julia
mrs lynde says there is no danger of my ever being one but you can never tell
at first as she told diana she did not really think she could
could she go back to the former quiet pleasures of those faraway days before the concert
my besetting sin is imagining too much and forgetting my duties
mrs lynde says she always feels shocked when she hears of anyone ever having been naughty no matter how small they were
cordelia was a regal brunette with a coronet of midnight hair and duskly flashing eyes
i wish my imagination was as good as yours
in four more years well be able to put our hair up said diana alice bell is only sixteen and she is wearing hers up but i think thats ridiculous
i found it rather hard to imagine the proposal because i had no experience to go by
you may have noticed that
ruby gillis says she means to have a beau as soon as shes fifteen said diana
reading stories is bad enough but writing them is worse
i just lay awake and imagined the concert over and over again
mrs allan says that ought to be our object in everything
junior avonlea found it hard to settle down to humdrum existence again
to anne in particular things seemed fearfully flat stale and unprofitable after the goblet of excitement she had been sipping for weeks
ruby gillis is rather sentimental
do you think there is any prospect of it marilla
its about two beautiful maidens called cordelia montmorency and geraldine seymour who lived in the same village and were devotedly attached to each other
i mostly always have to tell them what to write about but that isnt hard for ive millions of ideas
with the exception of these trifling frictions work in miss stacys little kingdom went on with regularity and smoothness
i simply cant talk about josie pye without making an uncharitable speech so i never mention her at all
the idea of miss stacy telling us to write a story out of our own heads
then bertram devere came to their native village and fell in love with the fair geraldine
it really is a great comfort to me
i asked ruby gillis if she knew anything about how men proposed because i thought shed likely be an authority on the subject having so many sisters married
i wont say what i was going to because it was extremely uncharitable
each girl has to read her story out loud and then we talk it over
i dont see how you can make up such thrilling things out of your own head anne
the moral is the great thing
as for cordelia she went insane with remorse and was shut up in a lunatic asylum
im trying to be as much like mrs allan as i possibly can for i think shes perfect mr allan thinks so too
mrs allan says we should never make uncharitable speeches but they do slip out so often before you think dont they
i wrote it last monday evening
im sure mrs allan was never such a silly forgetful little girl as you are
geraldine had an alabaster brow too
i shall wait until im seventeen
this was how the story club came into existence
well what became of cordelia and geraldine asked diana who was beginning to feel rather interested in their fate
geraldine accepted him in a speech a page long
it shows our club is doing some good in the world
besides i was comparing it with my own nose and thats vanity
i never saw anybody with purple eyes said diana dubiously
how perfectly lovely sighed diana who belonged to matthews school of critics
i read one of my stories to him and mrs allan and they both agreed that the moral was excellent
you ought to cultivate your imagination you know miss stacy says so
ill help you along until you can do them by yourself
no but she wasnt always so good as she is now either said anne seriously
im afraid i think too much about my nose ever since i heard that compliment about it long ago
i insist upon that
it must be a great deal better to be sensible but still i dont believe id really want to be a sensible person because they are so unromantic
i shouldnt say there was a great deal was marillas encouraging answer
i wanted something out of the common
im sure that must have a wholesome effect
just think diana im thirteen years old today remarked anne in an awed voice
i can tell you i took a lot of trouble with that speech
but she pretended to be geraldines friend the same as ever
thats something to remember for our woods composition
theyre so white and still as if they were asleep and dreaming pretty dreams
but perhaps that is only because im tired
i do really try to make it my object but i forget so often when im having fun
they grew in beauty side by side until they were sixteen
you know so much more than you did when you were only twelve
i think this story writing business is the foolishest yet scoffed marilla
only we must take the right way
ruby gillis thinks of nothing but beaus said anne disdainfully shes actually delighted when anyone writes her name up in a take notice for all she pretends to be so mad
i suppose you have your composition all done
it was certainly extremely difficult to be dignified under the circumstances
it was splendid to fish for trout over the bridge and the two girls learned to row themselves about in the little flat bottomed dory mr barry kept for duck shooting
it makes me feel frightened girls
an unfortunate lily maid
now push the flat off
it was annes idea that they dramatize elaine
annes plan was hailed with enthusiasm
cant we be good friends
she hated gilbert blythe
now a red haired person cannot be a lily maid
the flat began to leak
jane rose to the occasion
where were the oars
for a moment anne hesitated
oh anne how splendid of him
we cant have the old dumb servitor because there isnt room for two in the flat when one is lying down
its silly for elaine to be talking when shes dead
suppose nobody ever came
dyeing my hair cured me of vanity
why didnt somebody come
the haunted wood mistake cured me of letting my imagination run away with me
and todays mistake is going to cure me of being too romantic
she would never forgive him
oh yes i think i will marilla returned anne optimistically
lets be friends
id be popping up every minute or so to see where i was and if i wasnt drifting too far out
that scene of two years before flashed back into her recollection as vividly as if it had taken place yesterday
and there i was mrs allan clinging to that slippery old pile with no way of getting up or down
but first you must be the brothers and the father
you know the piles are just old tree trunks and there are lots of knots and old branch stubs on them
no she said coldly i shall never be friends with you gilbert blythe and i dont want to be
without waiting for an answer he pulled close to the pile and extended his hand
chapter twenty eight
a white lily was not obtainable just then but the effect of a tall blue iris placed in one of annes folded hands was all that could be desired
ruby ought to be elaine because she is so fair and has such lovely long golden hairelaine had all her bright hair streaming down you know
you know elaine lay as though she smiled thats better
and ruby is in hystericsoh anne how did you escape
ruby you shouldnt talk about mrs lynde said anne severely
she was really quite unstrung for the reaction from her fright and cramped clinging was making itself felt
she almost wished she had answered gilbert differently
help would soon come but meanwhile her position was a very uncomfortable one
left behind at the landing
i think your hair is awfully pretty nowhonest i do
now shes all ready said jane
its fun then
and you know anne that would spoil the effect
her heart gave a quick queer little beat
weve gone and lost your fathers flat diana and i have a presentiment that well not be allowed to row on the pond any more
her imagination began to suggest all manner of gruesome possibilities to her
your complexion is just as fair as rubys said diana earnestly and your hair is ever so much darker than it used to be before you cut it
i feel quite sure that you will soon see a great improvement in me in this respect marilla
it is all my fault
ruby you must be king arthur and jane will be guinevere and diana must be lancelot
ill never ask you to be friends again anne shirley
i feel sure i was born under an unlucky star
great was the consternation in the barry and cuthbert households when the events of the afternoon became known
i dont see how said marilla
of course i wont flashed anne with a momentary return of her old spirit
the girls went for help
but its so ridiculous to have a redheaded elaine mourned anne
and i dont care either
the black shawl having been procured anne spread it over the flat and then lay down on the bottom with closed eyes and hands folded over her breast
it was probably easy enough in towered camelot hundreds of years ago but romance is not appreciated now
under such circumstances you dont think much about making a flowery prayer
what has happened anne asked gilbert taking up his oars
they had often gone down like this and nothing could be more convenient for playing elaine
im not afraid to float down and id love to be elaine
suppose they had fainted one and all
but its ridiculous just the same
im awfully sorry i made fun of your hair that time
where had the girls gone
the affair of the amethyst brooch cured me of meddling with things that didnt belong to me
there was one chancejust one
but to lie down and pretend i was deadi just couldnt
of course he had insulted her terribly but still
all right gilbert sprang into his skiff with an angry color in his cheeks
a good cry indulged in the grateful solitude of the east gable had soothed her nerves and restored her to her wonted cheerfulness
jane you arrange this
the flat was accordingly pushed off scraping roughly over an old embedded stake in the process
but the bitterness of her old grievance promptly stiffened up her wavering determination
at this rate the flat would fill and sink long before it could drift to the lower headland
i prayed mrs allan most earnestly but i didnt shut my eyes to pray for i knew the only way god could save me was to let the flat float close enough to one of the bridge piles for me to climb up on it
will you ever have any sense anne groaned marilla
it spoils the effect because this is hundreds of years before mrs lynde was born
do you think it could be called auburn now diana
i said a grateful prayer at once and then i gave all my attention to holding on tight for i knew i should probably have to depend on human aid to get back to dry land
she had an odd newly awakened consciousness under all her outraged dignity that the half shy half eager expression in gilberts hazel eyes was something that was very good to see
gilbert obligingly rowed to the landing and anne disdaining assistance sprang nimbly on shore
i could never have the courage to float down there
mrs lynde says that all play acting is abominably wicked
i made the quarrel up and afterwards got giorgio into cardinal de medici s household and continually helped him
i was tormented by thirst but had abstained from drinking for many days according to the doctors orders
i meanwhile was waiting and put my hands among the breast feathers of the geese and felt them very warm
i told him that i had come therein that way solely in order to clear my character
accordingly she allowed me twice to take as much as i could of the water so that in good earnest i swallowed more than a flask full
that day many friends came to see me among others pier landi who was the best and dearest friend i ever had
you have never made anything so exquisite which proves you our inveterate foe and their devoted friend and yet the pope and he have had it twice in mind to hang you without any fault of yours that was the father and the son now beware of the holy ghost it was firmly believed that duke alessandro was the son of pope clement
my sickness had been of such a very serious nature that it seemed impossible for me to fling it off
it was close upon nightfall and during the day i had shot a good number of ducks and geese then as i had almost made my mind up to shoot no more that time we were returning briskly toward rome
trusting to my boots which came high up the leg i put one foot forward it sank in the oozy ground and so although i got the goose the boot of my right leg was full of water
we often held such conversations but i remember one in particular on the day of epiphany when we were together near la magliana
this woke me up and i called out leave her alone perhaps when she meant to do me harm she did me more good than you were able to do with all your efforts
cardinal cornaro when he heard of my improvement had me transported to a place of his on monte cavallo
when eight days had come and gone my amendment was so slight that life itself became almost a burden to me indeed i had been more than fifty days in that great suffering
the duke gazed at me and marvelled i was still alive afterwards he bade me take heed to be an honest man and regain my health
you see his malady has been so grave that if we had brought him the extreme unction we might not have been in time
the very evening i was taken with great precautions in a chair well wrapped up and protected from the cold
for these deserts then he told duke alessandro that i had abused his excellency and had bragged i meant to be the first to leap upon the walls of florence with his foes the exiles
that worthy man maestro francesco da norcia redoubled his efforts and brought me every day fresh remedies trying to restore strength to my miserable unstrung frame
then after a short while the duke came by whereupon i had myself raised up before his excellency and he halted
do not permit him any irregularities for though he has escaped this time another disorder now would be the death of him
if you knew that his recovery depended upon his drinking two flasks of water why did you not say so before
he then said beware and added what displeasure have you given to that rascal ottaviano de medici i answered that i had done nothing to displease him but that he had injured me and told him all the affair about the mint
now he had heard the duke say benvenuto would have done much better to die because he is come to put his head into a noose and i will never pardon him accordingly when niccolò arrived he said to me in desperation alas my dear benvenuto what have you come to do here
they kept and showed it to the doctor who said he had never seen anything of the sort before and afterwards remarked to felice now take care of your benvenuto for he is cured
this maid had stolen from me certain little things of some importance and in her fear of being detected she would have been very glad if i had died
that old man ceased to give so much annoyance yet sometimes he appeared to me in dreams
maestro francesco then gave orders that i should be removed from my room and carried to one of the hills there are in rome
he repeated get hence as quickly as you can and be of good courage for you will see your vengeance executed sooner than you expect i the best attention to my health gave pietro pagolo advice about stamping the coins and then went off upon my way to rome without saying a word to the duke or anybody else
he had been brought by my very dear friend luca martini who passed the larger portion of the day with me
this man had no skill in my art but since we were perpetually day and night together everybody thought he was a first rate craftsman
i responded that he had done well to tell me so and that i would take such care of them that he should never see them more
this being so as he was a fellow of much humour we used often to laugh together about the great credit he had gained
i lifted my foot and let the water run out then when i had mounted we made haste for rome
i therefore dismounted at once got my fowling piece ready and at a very long range brought two of them down with a single ball
so i made my mind up and prepared to travel
he denied that it was so and that he had ever said anything of the sort
i now sent to florence to request lorenzino that he would send me the reverse of the medal
i composed the design of a reverse which seemed to me appropriate and pressed the work forward to my best ability
yet all these endeavours were apparently insufficient to overcome the obstinacy of my malady so that the physicians were in despair and at their wits ends what to do
of the two geese one was almost dead and the other though badly wounded was flying lamely
did you not know what you have done to displease the duke
i never used to shoot with more than one ball and was usually able to hit my mark at two hundred cubits which cannot be done by other ways of loading
the doe had no doubt now
one was rowing the other had a gun in his hand
it was repeated
flight with the fawn was impossible
there was silence all about in the forest
the doe lifted her head with a quick motion
after running at high speed perhaps half a mile farther it occurred to her that it would be safe now to turn to the west and by a wide circuit seek her fawn
in five minutes more she had passed into a hillside clearing
the dogs were gaining again and she crossed the broad deep brook
if she could put that piece of water between her and her pursuers she would be safe
if the mother stepped a pace or two farther away in feeding the fawn made a half movement as if to rise and follow her
she descended the slope of the mountain until she reached the more open forest of hard wood
by this time the dogs panting and lolling out their tongues came swinging along keeping the trail like stupids and consequently losing ground when the deer doubled
in five minutes more she heard the sharp yelp of discovery and then the deep mouthed howl of pursuit
she heard a tinkle of bells
the cry of the hound was repeated more distinct this time
she went in the direction of the hounds
the fawn lay down contentedly and the doe licked him for a moment
had she strength to swim it
she must cross the slide brook valley if possible and gain the mountain opposite
there was a sound a distinct prolonged note pervading the woods
he wanted more breakfast for one thing and his mother wouldnt stand still
the danger was certain now it was near
at her first step into the water she saw a sight that sent her back with a bound
there was a boat mid lake two men were in it
with an affectionate glance at her fawn she continued picking up her breakfast
there was no time for hesitation
the fording of the river threw the hounds off for a time
not a merciful heart in all that lovely valley
the brave pretty creature was quite exhausted now
she bounded on she stopped
she could not crawl on in this way the dogs would soon be upon them
the mother bounded away a few paces
late in the afternoon she staggered down the shoulder of bartlett and stood upon the shore of the lake
but at the moment she heard a sound that chilled her heart
the baying of the hounds grew fainter behind
whenever the fawn caught up he was quite content to frisk about
he went to feed on the lily pads there
it was the cry of a hound to the west of her
she hesitated it was only for an instant
the buck his father had been that night on a long tramp across the mountain to clear pond and had not yet returned
from the valley ahead came the cry of a searching hound
the doe was daintily cropping tender leaves and turning from time to time to regard her offspring
that way also her enemies were
but there was the fawn
she turned again for flight
in a moment more she leaped into the travelled road
she was going due east when she turned away toward the north and kept on at a good pace
the dogs were not in sight but she could hear them coming down the hill
the courage of the panting fugitive was not gone but the fearful pace at which she had been going told on her
she turned her head to the south she listened intently
time enough to fly time enough to put miles between her and the hound before he should come upon her fresh trail yes time enough
what should she do
but when the doe had got into the timber she heard the savage brutes howling across the meadow it is well enough perhaps to say that nobody offered to shoot the dogs
she turned again to the centre of the lake
with only a moments hesitation she plunged into the lake
as she approached slide brook she saw a boy standing by a tree with a raised rifle
her legs trembled and her heart beat like a trip hammer
the doe returned stood by him head erect and nostrils distended perhaps she was thinking
the cruel sound gave wings to the poor thing
below her down the mountain slope were other clearings broken by patches of woods
the doe saw the boat nearing her
the doe bounded in advance and waited
there was nothing to do but to keep on and on she went with the noise of the pack behind her
a mile or two down lay the valley and the farmhouses
she slowed her speed but still fled up the right bank of the stream
the fawn scrambling after her tumbled over and bleated piteously
but suddenly she started head erect eyes dilated a tremor in her limbs
the fawn scrambled after her slipping and tumbling along and whining a good deal because his mother kept always moving away from him
she turned to the shore whence she came the dogs were lapping the water and howling there
she used the little respite to push on until the baying was faint in her ears
it was a pretty picturematernal love on the one part and happy trust on the other
but man is nobler than other animals
therefore in that state women would not have been born
therefore from the first they would have been imperfect in bodily size and power
but the same acts are not befitting to man at every season of life
but in that state nothing would have been unnatural in human generation
therefore also in the state of innocence male and female would have been born
wherefore it is natural on account of the considerable humidity of the brain in children that the nerves which are instruments of movement should not be apt for moving the limbs
therefore in the state of innocence children would not have been deprived of the use of their limbs
therefore in the state of innocence there was no need for women to be born
now it is clear that it is as natural as it is befitting to the principles of human nature that children should not have sufficient strength for the use of their limbs immediately after birth
wherefore in making any assertion we must be guided by the nature of things except in those things which are above nature and are made known to us by divine authority
whether in the primitive state women would have been born
because in proportion to other animals man has naturally a larger brain
therefore neither would there have been weakness of body in infants
but in the state of innocence children would have been begotten by generation
whether in the state of innocence children would have had perfect strength of body as to the use of its members immediately after birth
therefore neither would there have been such weakness in infancy
and they brought out the jaw bone of an ass with which samson did such great feats and the sling and stone with which david slew goliath of gath
christiani am come from the town of destruction and am on my way to mount zion but the day is far spent and i would with your leave pass the night here
but ere he got to the top the sun went down on christian and he soon saw that two wild beast stood in his way
christianyes i have
charityhave you a wife and babes
christianmy name is now christian but at first it was graceless
charityand did you pray to god to put it in their hearts to go with you
i am made to tread those steps thrice which i need not to have trod but once yea now too i am like to be lost in the night for the day is well nigh spent
ah thought he these beasts range in the night for their prey and if they should meet with me in the dark how should i fly from them
tell me whence come you
watchfulwhat is your name
when watchful told her why christian had come there she said what is your name
christianyes and that with much warmth for you may think how dear they were to me
the sun is set
words are too weak to tell the joy of christian when he had got back his scroll
he laid it up in the breast of his coat and gave thanks to god
watchfulhow is it you came so late
there they say is no death and there i shall dwell with such as love the lord
i see now the cause of all those fears that drove mistrust and timorous back
fear not the two wild beasts for they are bound by chains and are put here to try the faith of those that have it and to find out those that have none
o that i had not slept
then they told him it was immanuels land
christianfriend what shall we do
shall we let giant despair rule us
who knows but that god who made the world may cause him to die or lose the use of his limbs as he did at first
therefore the subjection of other animals to man is proved to be natural
whether man had mastership over all other creatures
now in man reason has the position of a master and not of a subject
so in the state of innocence man had mastership over the animals by commanding them
but man needed animals in order to have experimental knowledge of their natures
therefore in the state of innocence before man had disobeyed nothing disobeyed him that was naturally subject to him
secondly this is proved by the order of divine providence which always governs inferior things by the superior
there might also have been bodily disparity
whether men were equal in the state of innocence
for augustine says de civ
moreover as regards the soul there would have been inequality as to righteousness and knowledge
but of the natural powers and the body itself man is master not by commanding but by using them
therefore certain things in regard to animals could be done by angels which could not be done by man for instance the rapid gathering together of all the animals
therefore all were equal
this is signified by the fact that god led the animals to man that he might give them names expressive of their respective natures
now an angel is naturally higher than man
therefore etc
wherefore man had no mastership over the angels in the primitive state so when we read all creatures we must understand the creatures which are not made to gods image
this can be proved in three ways
first because man is naturally a social being and so in the state of innocence he would have led a social life
yes indeed
well im a rich man now and so is my mate mclaughlin for that wood was contracted for by the largest and richest piano firm in this country and now it is all but delivered to them and the money in our hands
well then we were quarantined
well it was a long slow job to drag those heavy logs around that point and just when we were making headway along comes a storm that drove the schooner and canoes out of business
the happy reunion
the sun seemed stronger each time it made its way out from behind a cloud just as little girls and boys grow strong in body by exercise and strong in character by efforts to do right
and last night what an awful experience they had remarked one of the spectators
we counted on getting home last week when this last storm struck us and drove us out of our course
the rough ocean winds had tanned them like bronze and their muscles were as firm and strong almost as the cables that swing out with the buoys
couldnt get things to eat without a lot of trouble and couldnt go on with the carting until the authorities decided the fever was not serious
two vessels had been wrecked trying to get it so when we got to the west indies i decided to try canoes and not risk sails where the wind always blew such a gale it dragged any anchor that could be dropped
it would have taken us a lifetime to accumulate as much money as we have earned in this year
of course it was hard for the men who had families mclaughlin especially the others were all working sailors but he was a landsman and my partner in the enterprise but i will make it up to him and the mahogany hunt will turn out the best paying piece of work he ever undertook
there is not much to tell began the captain
here mate mclaughlin told about the big storm and how long it took the small crew to repair the damage done to the sails
chapter twenty
besides added someone else they are all going to receive extra good pay for the captain and mate will be very rich when the cargo is landed
of course i knew we were going to have trouble getting that mahogany
but we have to go to school said nan and we have only a few days more
it is no wonder that they are all so happy to night
indeed i do not like shopping answered the cousin
a beautiful day had grown out of the dreadful storm
if there is one thing in this world worth while it is fun and she tossed her yellow head about like a buttercup that has no other way of laughing
i broke ten and injured more than i wanted to count
how rugged and handsome the men looked
oh ill come if you make it jolly answered dorothy
then it was well worth all your sacrifice said mr minturn
he made the clerks remove all the truck from the aisles and i guess everybody was glad the army fell down
the largest hotel at sunset beach was thrown open to the sailors that night and here captain bingham and mate mclaughlin together with the rest of the crew took up comfortable lodgings
no she didnt either corrected dorothy
but all the same sighed dorothy i just know you will all be going home before we leave for the city and i shall just die of loneliness
you will never again have to go back to that horrid store that made you so pale and your mother will have a lovely time and nothing to worry about
i can hardly believe it all replied their little friend
i hope you can come to lakeport for thanksgiving said nan
and everybody was so happy
that was what delayed us so
then we had to go back to work at the logs went on the captain and then one of our crew took a fever
oh isnt it perfectly splendid declared nan and dorothy hugging nellie
we might be able to manage that too nellie told him
oh yes mother im coming replied nellie
the last night at the seashore was passed and the early morning found them once more traveling awaythis time for dear old home sweet home
i wonder if all the other girls will be home at lakeport in time for the first day of school said nan
then perhaps we can give a real harvest party out at lakeport and try to repay our friends for some of their hospitality to us
vacation was just long enough i think
those we get down here always seem soft and salty like the spray
most of them i guess answered bert
well we have had a good vacation and i am willing to go to work again
and we will be on hand thank you replied the joking dorothy
if we only didnt have to leave our friends complained nan brushing back a tear as the very last glint of cousin dorothys yellow head passed by the train window
where is your hat
look called flossie as the train made a turn and whistled a good by to the bobbsey twins at the seashore
there were the shells to be looked after the fish nets besides downy the duck and snoop the cat
perhaps they will buy another tent with it for they need more room out at meadow brook
chapter twenty one
there goes the last of the ocean
be sure to have ice cream and chocolatesi want some good fresh chocolates
and so our little friends had spent all their vacation
it is not long until thanksgiving
you are quite rich now arent you remarked dorothy
oh that will be splendid declared nan
i hope we will meet them all soon again said nans mother
bert had the donkey cart hitched and there was now no time to spare nellie kissed freddie and flossie affectionately and promised to bring the little boy all through a big city real fire engine house when he came to see her
good by
come nellie called mrs mclaughlin i am ready
now father is home again i can hardly believe it
mr bobbsey was down from the city of course to take the family home and now all hands even freddie and flossie were busy packing up
dorothy gave nan a beautiful little gold locket with her picture in it and flossie received the dearest little real shell pocketbook ever seen
so am i declared nan
arriving at hartford on the thirty first of october sixteen eighty seven andros found the general assembly in session in the meeting house
we humbly prostrate ourselves our privileges our all at the gracious feet of your majesty with an entire resolution to serve you with faithful hearts
have you got it
i remember such an order and furthermore that all the colonies complied with his infamous demand save connecticut
i saw him he struck my hand in the dark yet i knew it was he
as long as american students shall study the history of their country will the charter oak be famous
charles got as close to the long table used by the secretaries as possible without attracting special attention
they knew all their relatives in virginia maryland and carolinia
no already i have waited too long
treason
the day was well nigh spent when he arrived and the members were engaged in a heated debate on a subject of the utmost importance
the stevens family was growing with the colonies
little did the captain or his youthful assistant dream that their simple act would make the old tree historic
what lights
yes
mr prince to convince him of the danger they were in continued
yes charles you will answer
i hope you will not endanger your own life
i will do it at the exact moment uncle
the debate was drawing to a close or in fact had gone as far as it could without arousing the suspicion of governor andros
wait began the president
before that body with armed men at his back he demanded a formal surrender of the precious charter into his hands
the members received him with the courtesy due to his rank
andros appears as a usurper of authoritythe willing instrument of king james the second who it seems has determined to hold absolute rule over all new england
nothing is easier
it was the boy cried the enraged governor
that is true captain wadsworth continued mr prince and to subdue our stubbornness this viceroy has come to hartford with sixty armed men to demand the surrender of the charter in person
will you fight them
by no means but i want you to be fully impressed with the seriousness of your mission
the debate was at a white heat
mr prince fixed his amazed eyes on the captains face and read there a desperate determination
more than a dozen years had passed since andros had been humiliated by connecticut and despite his anathemas the colony quietly pursued the even tenor of its way
the fellow though given to boasting is not dangerous or liable to put his threats into execution
i am
they had reached the outskirts of the village and paused beneath the wide spreading branches of a great oak tree
time passed on and darkness had enveloped the earth
charles stevens saw the outline of his uncle who seized the box and hurried with it from the meeting house
the liberties of the colony are involved
mr prince bowed and hastily returned to the house where the assembly was in session
he is from massachusetts and beyond even the claimed bounds of your jurisdiction
he has promised to do so
the people of rhode island were restive under the petty tyranny of andros and when they heard of the imprisonment of the despot at boston in sixteen eighty nine they assembled at newport resumed popular government under the old charter and began a new independent political career
they have enough to do in there answered the boy pointing toward the meeting house in which pandemonium seemed to reign
it will give us time
for a few moments the outwitted governor stood glaring at first one and then the other of the assembly
as early as sixteen seventy five he went to the mouth of the connecticut river with a small naval force to assert his authority
where is the charter no one answered and with bosom swelling with indignation at being cheated by a device of the shrewd members of the assembly he threatened to have them arrested
look well at the setting sun you may not live to see it rise
marry boy have a care how you approach me
you do not expect me to be a coward
lights
on the very day of the arrival of charles stevens at hartford while he was talking with captain wadsworth his aunts husband a member of the colonial assembly suddenly entered the house his face flushed with excitement
captain wadsworth went out and on his way looked into the state house where everything was going as well as he could have wished
what are you going to do with it charles asked
charles you see the soldiers of governor andros at the state house
take your place charles and be prepared to do your part whispered captain wadsworth
he found the debaters cudgelling their brains for something to say to the point or against it
i have not answered one
the members of the assembly were alarmed and amazed at his request
nor i
every member of the assembly shook their heads
charles stevens smiled and answered
why should that alarm us
have no fear on that score
i demand the charter at once
yes
light the candles he cried and we will have peace when the candles were relighted the members were seen seated about the table in perfect order but the charter could nowhere be seen
hasten back to the assembly and i will follow in a few moments
at the proper time put out the lights in the assembly but wait i will go and muster the train bands and have them at hand to prevent the governors soldiers from injuring the members of the general assembly
but he has grown dangerous declared mr prince
at the end of that period a most exciting incident occurred at hartford during the visit of charles stevens to that city
uncle
he does not live in connecticut
charles stevens but a youth was on a visit to connecticut when an event transpired which has since become historical
you have your soldiers at the door and we have the train bands of connecticut ready to defend us against violence
the sun was setting and the captain said
then you can put out the lights
can you do it
i have waited as long as i will
come charles let us hasten to the assembly
captain wadsworth became a little uneasy though he was still inclined to treat the matter lightly
my train bands have their eyes on them
i am going to do something desperate
what has happened mr prince wadsworth asked for he could see that the man was greatly excited
who of you has the charter
mr prince our liberties are in danger and there is no time to think of life
never did debaters take greater interest in a minor subject
there have been so many stories told of the charter oak that the author here feels justified in stepping aside from the narrative to quote from the journal for june fifteenth sixteen eighty seven the following entry
uncle something terrible is going to happen i know from your look and words
are you willing to help us
he shall not have it
the imputation is false
it stood in a vacant lot on the south side of charter street a few rods from main street in the city of hartford
a terrible uproar and confusion inside attracted the attention of everybody so captain wadsworth escaped without being noticed with the precious document under his arm the youth was close behind him and when they were outside seized his arm
why
where does he live
we do not know him
as the student of american history doubtless knows the tyrannical governor andros of new york claimed dominion over all that scope of country denominated as the new netherland a very indefinite term applied to a great scope of country extending from maryland to the connecticut river to which point andros claimed jurisdiction
where is he
when it ended the governor of new york declared
nor i answered each and every one
once in the street they hastened away at a rapid pace
this historical incident has about it all the rosy hues of romance
governor andros has come again gasped mr prince
wont you let me go with you
he followed him as rapidly as he could
they may hear you
the boy did it
as soon as he was gone charles stevens said
though the lights were extinguished through the windows the faint starlight dimly illuminated the scene
hasten back mr prince and whisper in the ears of every member to prolong the debate
he consented however to await the discussion but as soon as it was ended he declared that he would have the charter
we have no wish to shed their blood
bring it at once
we have stubbornly refused to yield our charter voluntarily for it is the guardian of our political rights
so this is another trick
what is the assembly doing
then while charles stood as sentry he went to the tree and put the charter in the hollow
stand a little way off charles commanded the captain
safe and well came the welcome answer
a big roller dashing in finished the work for the life guards and a man in the cork belt bounded upon shore
mrs bobbsey had been holding mrs mclaughlin back but now the sailor was quite recovered so they allowed her to speak to him
see there goes the buoy and then the queer looking life preserver made of cork and shaped like breeches swung out over the waves
and little nellie
here she comes called the crowd presently as the black speck far out and the strain on the cord showed the buoy was coming back
everybody gathered around and nellie with a strange face and a stranger hope broke through the crowd to see the rescued man
mrs mclaughlin and her little daughter strained their eyes to see if possible what might be going on down at the beach
nearer and nearer it came until now a mans head could be seen
he was quite breathless when the guards reached him but insisted on walking up instead of being carried
life savers
they have found a wreck
it is just like a story in a book
and is george bingham out there anxiously asked the brother
i am replied the sailor
mother mother called nellie look down at the beach
and hal and his father too put in nan
george bingham
hello there called mr bingham well if this isnt luck
just as mr bingham said the life saving work turned out to be a social affair for there was a great time greeting nellies father and hals uncle
yes come along answered mr minturn and as day began to peep through the heavy clouds the two hurried down to the spot where the life guards were burning their red light to tell the sailors their signal had been seen
i only came in to tell you began george bingham that we are all right and the boat is lifting off the sand bar we stuck on
it was almost morning but the black storm clouds held the daylight back
the life guards are burning the red signal lights
even the guards who were busy again at the ropes having left the man to willing hands on the beach could not hide their surprise over the fact that it was mother father and daughter there united under such strange conditions
what a wonderful scene it was
its a schooner said mr bingham to mr minturn and she has a very heavy cargo
with the daylight came girls and women to the beach
just waiting for his turn to come in
i guess our prayers were heard last night
it was clear day now and much of the wicked storm had passed
it seemed a long time before any movement of the cable showed that the buoy was returning
wasnt it perfectly splendid that nellie and her mother were here declared dorothy
whats that board for asked bert as he saw a board following the cable
to this cord was fastened a heavy rope or cable
here she comes
as mr bingham told the guards it would not be necessary to haul any more men in and as the sea was calm enough now to launch a life boat both nellies father and hals uncle insisted on going back to the vessel to the other men
theres the vessel exclaimed bert as a rocket flew up from the water
the child almost unconscious in her fathers arms he almost dead from exhaustion and the wife and mother too overcome to trust herself to believe it could be true
what a morning that was at sunset beach
its effect upon the sea was however more furious every hour for while the storm had left the land it was raging somewhere else and the sensitive sea felt every throb of the excited elements
chapter nineteen
instantly there shot out to sea a ball of thin cord
mr bingham and hal had been watching it all anxiously
oh i see said bert the line will stretch then and the breeches buoy will go out on a pulley
im so glad we prayed said little flossie to freddie when she heard the good news
so youve found friends mclaughlin he added seeing the little family united why how do you do mrs mclaughlin he went on offering her his hand
but im glad i came in tothe reception he said laughing
yes thats the distress signal replied the uncle
mrs bobbsey mrs minturn nellie and her mother besides dorothy and nan were all there flossie and freddie being obliged to stay home with dinah and susan
two boats were launched a strong guard going in each with mr mclaughlin in one and mr bingham in the other and now they pulled out steadily over the waves back to the vessel that was freeing itself from the sand bar
the girls and women were too frightened to talk and nellie clung close to her mother
i am very fond of her
in fact she had perfectly confounded her ladyship by her demeanor
when i find a fellow whos neither knave nor fool i stick to him
ah commented barold
and you are not afraid
it is scarcely a joyous occasion to my mind
shes prettier than ever to day and is enjoying herself
its deucedly bad form on his part he said mentally
before breakfast miss belinda was startled by the arrival of another telegram which ran as follows
im not sure that i follow all her moods myself
sheshe has very pretty ways
very few people understand octavia said miss belinda
going to a funeral he demanded
octavia is most happy to day answered miss belinda
friend with me
nothing whatever he replied
she is not as frivolous as she appears to those who dont know her well
where he ejaculated
she is usually paler
i beg you will not speak to me of that again she said i will not listen and turning about she walked out of the room
her father will reach slowbridge this evening
i shall not be afraid again
lady theobalds manner was chiefly distinguished by an implacable rigidity
i made it myself
burmistone he said after having spoken his first words who is that tall girl in white
i had not observed it answered her ladyship
have you any message for my mother
she was enjoying herself
dont deride my youth and ignorance miss bassett
well remarked octavia i suppose that would have been an advantage
martin bassett
what has happened she asked rigidly
its an old dress i remodelled answered lucia somewhat alarmed
he was not very comfortable
wheres lucia
dear dear martin she wept to think that we should meet again
barold stood gnawing his mustache and made no reply
dont call on grandmamma until after wednesday she had said to mr burmistone perhaps she wouldnt let me go
no she answered i am not afraid at all
i would rather try the other thank you he laughed
mr francis barold observed it rather gloomily as he stood apart
i never killed a man in my life
i say what a name
octavia on the contrary did not ask what he meant by it
arrived to day per russia be with you tomorrow evening
if you go to nevada you must visit the mines at bloody gulch she said
if i were sure this was the same man id go myself
i accompany my granddaughter to thisthis entertainment her ladyship responded
hand over those vs
day at length dawned
deal sir if you please better luck next time
whats the price of wood
the pilots here changed places
hallo the woodyard
still with all these disadvantages they continued playingthey wanted to learn the game
the wooding completed we paddled on again
the game went on and the paddles kept moving
we were nearing the shore for the purpose of looking for wood the banks being invisible from the middle of the river
hallo colonel
this wood seems rather better than that we took in at yellow faces but were nearly out again and must be looking out for more
what did you understand
well remarked octavia you wont do it i suppose
octavia she added turning upon her with flushing cheeks and sparkling eyes i think that for the first time in my life i am in a passiona real passion
she was afraid to tell me in plain wordsi never saw her afraid before but she was afraid
lucia thought deeply for a moment she recognized all at once several things she had been mystified by before
lucia he said i wish you would let me go and talk with lady theobald
she wondered if he had heard her last words she fancied he had
dugald binnie is at oldclough
there was a hint of exultation in her tone
i am angry she said
but it was not against him that lucias indignation was aroused
he is my grand uncle explained lucia tremulously
it is she said
i will go home and tell her what i think
if i make the marriage she chooses she thinks mr binnie will leave me his money i am to run after a man who does not care for me and make myself attractive in the hope that he will condescend to marry me because mr binnie may leave me his money
yes he answered
who is he
what did she say inquired octavia
mr dugald binnie had not proved to be a very fascinating person
if she had only thought of it because mr binnie came i could have forgiven her more easily but she has been making coarse plans all the time and treating me with contempt
i think i shall never be afraid of her any more her delicate nostrils were dilated she held her head up her breath came fast
and then almost before she knew what she was doing she was pouring forth the whole of her story even more of it than she had told octavia she had not at all intended to do it but she did it nevertheless
lucia sat thinking her hands clasped tightly
you have never seen me angry before
she knew there would be no use in trying to conceal the truth and she was not in the mood to make the effort
she walked very fast after she left the house
i dont want to be cool she said
and i am not afraid of her at all
how did you guess she exclaimed
she scarcely knew herself
do you wonder that it took even lady theobald a long time to say that
let me go to her
but he drew her gently with him and a few steps took them into the shade of the young oaks and pines and there he paused
burmistone
he was an acrid dictatorial old man he contradicted lady theobald flatly every five minutes and bullied his man servant
what are you going to say to her he asked
never
is it enough
she laughed again
never
oh it is
he has a great deal of money
mr burmistone she said mr
i am going to ask her what she means
grandmammashe stopped short and colored and drew her slight figure up
i am glad i came here she said at length
this is my blessing
as he did so he started back it was not the same girl
as you are so generously taking her on trust may she never cause you a moments regret
in his anger he cursed me saying o wicked one for this offence you are condemned to be changed into a piece of unconscious metal
how is it possible that the princess should have fallen in love with such a paltry wretch overlooking a man like me
one day as i was flying through the air wearing a white dress a swan mistaking me for a lotus flower attacked me
the attendants in the adjoining apartments hearing the scream thought something dreadful must have happened
you have in consequence suffered all this misery
she humbly bowing down said let my lord pardon his servant for the injury which she has unconsciously caused
having made himself invisible he entered without difficulty the apartment of the princess and was astonished and enraged on finding her lying in your arms
i am an apsaras born from the rays of the moon
a terrible battle ensued in which both kings performed prodigies of valour
treated thus like some wild beast roughly shaken and neglected rajavahana would have suffered greatly had he not been protected by the magic jewel given to him in patala and which he had contrived to conceal in his hair
on his way he saw the silver fetter descended to the ground picked it up and continued his flight
they rushed into the room added their cries to hers and forgetting all their former precautions left the doors open so that the guards outside hearing the clamour entered and saw the prince
thus the princess listening with delight and astonishment to the sweet and eloquent words of her husband and he never tired of contemplating her beauty and enjoying her caresses lived for some time in the greatest happiness without care or anxiety for the future
she is a disgrace to her family and shall soon see her husband impaled on a stake
sinhavarma being of a very impatient and impetuous disposition would not wait for the arrival of the allies who had been summoned to his assistance and were then on the march but throwing open the gates went forth to meet the enemy
have ready also a fierce elephant suitably equipped which i shall mount immediately after the wedding to overtake my army in march against the enemy and as i set out i will make the elephant trample the life out of that criminal
oh how do you do mr strong and he ran to meet the head teacher
she didnt seem to mind it
mrs green did not speak to him for almost a week after that
oh dear you never did anything never and mrs green shook her head warningly
why nothing aleck my boy
there you are said sam at last
oh my
raise you right hand to your breast just as all statesmen do
indeed
oh im going in for study this session answered tom demurely and then he winked at larry on the sly
but his words did not deceive george strong who understood only too well toms propensity for mischief
to be sure
now stand still and ill take a snap shot
not at all
what was her trouble tomconsumption
splendid sir said tom
and yet with it all she couldnt help but like the boy
i dont see any picture growled snuggers looking at the square blankly
how are youpretty well
how about it and his eyes twinkled
ive gained fifteen pounds and
im first rate never was better in my life and he gave the hand a hard squeeze
i didnt mean itreally i didnt
mrs green when you die they ought to erect an awfully big monument over your grave
ii dont know sobbed tom
so youve come back have you observed mrs green as tom stopped at the kitchen door
its really like home he murmured presently
now wait a minute and the picture will be finished
have you got a camera
its just out of the oven
to have a photograph taken for nothing tickled him greatly
hullo aleck cried tom rushing up and grabbing the colored man by the hand
the idol virabudra is carried to a mantapam outside the town and placed on the ground
as long as the god remains in the mantapam the scorpions do not sting but directly he leaves it they resume their poisonous propensities
the excrement of lizards fed on scorpions and the undigested food in the stomach of a freshly killed goat dried and reduced to powder are also believed to be effective remedies
the root should be collected on a new moon day which falls on a sunday
on that day the sakuna pakshi bathes cuts off his loin cloth and goes stark naked to a selected spot where he gathers the roots
some families keep in their homes small pots called thelkodukku undi scorpion sting vessels and occasionally drop therein a copper coin which is supposed to secure immunity against scorpion sting
it is generally supposed that no scorpion can live in this village and that the sacred ashes from sattandi ammans shrine are a specific for scorpion stings
the village goddess at nangavaram in the trichinopoly district is called sattandi amman and her idol represents her in the act of weaving a garland of scorpions
who then
she will tell you nothing ill of herself of course
i have too much to say
i tell you i love louise to distraction
the cunning captain was quite right in his suspicions for as soon as montalais entered she exclaimed oh monsieur
i never mix myself up in affairs of that kind you know that very well
very fine indeed
of course i should go about all day saying ah what a fine stupid fellow that bragelonne was as great a stupid as i ever met with
i begin to believe there is fire when i see smoke
why you see raoul if i had an ideabut i have not got one
how very fortunate that is he was looking for you too
the portrait
i am indeed and you know the reason very well monsieur dartagnan
raoul buried his face in his hands murmuring no no i have not a single friend in the world
how much i should regret you
no it is not from curiosity it is from love
another big word
what the deuce is the matter that you look as you do and what makes you so dumb said the captain
and a fine affair that would be
i have passed my whole life almost in teaching him how to hold and use his sword properly and the silly fellow has got himself spitted like a lark go then raoul go and get yourself disposed of if you like
i should quarrel with you
who is that
raoul was already pale enough and he now began to turn his hat round and round in his hand
a woman
i have neither head nor arm do not despise but help me
it will kill me he said
ah she said in the same tone of voice it is not i who am going to speak to him
it is madame who has sent for him
so be off
do people nowadays assume that sort of airs in england
every one
i hardly know who can have taught you logic but deuce take me if your father has not been regularly robbed of his money
but you ask me all sorts of questions and i answer you
you distress me you do indeed
dartagnan increased the sharpness of his penetrating gaze which no secret was capable of resisting
she is deceiving you said dartagnan not a muscle of whose face had moved those are big words
of course
what not for a friend for a son
wait if you can
you wish to be consoled by some one and you will be so at once
oh try try
so much the better
raoul struck his forehead with his hand in utter despair
well i admit it
you are unhappy about something he said
so much the worse
nay do not pretend to be astonished
there there now
you would listen to me but you would not hear me
monsieur
i have been in england and came here again as lively as a chaffinch
who makes use of them
you are mistaken monsieur replied raoul the woman i mean will tell me all the evil she possibly can
i do not understand that at all
i do not suppose it will concern you
i have told you for the last hour that i know nothing of the whole affair
idle fancies monsieur
you would hear but you would not understand me you would understand but you would not obey me
i cannot
to me murmured dartagnan
well suppose it were only that
what do you mean
good
i beg your pardon monsieur dartagnan
forgive me my dear friend i was going to ask you that
what should i care
i am not pretending to be astonished my friend
in two words i am the most wretched of living beings
oh yes indeed in order that you may get deeper into the mire
exactly
how is porthos do you know
that the king has not recalled you and you have returned
ah if every one says so there must be some truth in it
yes yes you now assume a different tone instead of killing you will get killed yourself i suppose you mean
indeed yes
it is exactly like a man with a toothache who keeps on saying oh what torture i am suffering
i forgive you mademoiselle said dartagnan i know that at my age those who are looking for me generally need me for something or another
the captain sitting buried in his leathern armchair his spurs fixed in the floor his sword between his legs was reading a number of letters as he twisted his mustache
a carpenter what do you mean
no sensible man ever succeeded in making much of a brain when the head was turned
i have completely lost my senses in the same way a hundred times in my life
oh certainly
so you have said already
to look for some one who will tell me the truth
even if i were unfortunate enough to know something and foolish enough to communicate it to youyou are my friend you say
i go far
dartagnan could read to the very bottom of the young mans heart
bragelonne continues his inquiries
saint aignan follows malicornes advice
i am here dear louise said raoul running towards her
but the door remained closed and neither saint aignan nor the painter appeared nor did the hangings even move
suddenly a noise upon the upper floor was heard which had in fact continued though it had remained unnoticed for some time it had at last aroused la vallieres attention though but slowly so
quick quick
and again when the artist following malicornes advice was a little late in arriving and when saint aignan had been obliged to be absent for some time it was interesting to observe though no one witnessed them those moments of silence full of deep expression which united in one sigh two souls most disposed to understand each other and who by no means objected to the quiet meditation they enjoyed together
go then dearest love said the king but return quickly
i knew but too well that you had not ceased to love me
but suddenly the king who had heard louises exclamation darted through the opening and hurried forward to her assistance
but she gently shook her head as she replied happiness hidden power concealed my pride should be as silent as my heart
saint aignan was not within when la valliere who was now quite familiar with the lower story lifted up the trap door and descended
the king was less reserved and exhibited his annoyance by a very significant shrug of the shoulders at which la valliere could not help blushing
in a word malicorne philosopher that he was though he knew it not had learned how to inspire the king with an appetite in the midst of plenty and with desire in the assurance of possession
chapter thirty nine
malicorne will be delighted this evening as he in fact was when it was reported to him
some one is waiting for me above
my aunt adella gave megave usthe material she stammered
will you tell me where you got the silk of which your waist is made
when i saw your dress i felt sure you were related to her
she thought it a wonderful bit of good luck that penelope went out each of the evenings to study some especially difficult problems with a school chum
that pucker came often enough without being brought there by extra worries
she is such a darling sister
this was long ago you know when travelling and correspondence were not the easy matter of course things they are now
i declare it is as good as new
she looks as if she had just stepped out of the frame of some lovely old picture she said to herself
well let us go and have tea said penelope
you must come and see doris
tell me dorrie does it argue a lack of proper respect for my ancestors that i cant feel very enthusiastic over this heirloomespecially when grandmother hunter died years before i was born
penelope has studied so hard all winter and she hasnt gone anywhere thought the older sister wistfully
then you are my grandniece she said
penelope saverne was the daughter of my mother by her first husband
i wish i could think of some way to get you a new waist said doris with what these sisters called the poverty pucker coming in the centre of her pretty forehead
if it could only be managed
penelope was seventeen and when one is seventeen and cannot go to a party because one hasnt a suitable dress to wear the world is very apt to seem a howling wilderness
penelope thought her altogether charming
it will be such a nice surprise for her the sister mused jubilantly
doris dreamed of pretty dresses all that night and thought about them all the next day
isnt it all wonderful doris hunter
id better be putting my grey matter into that algebra instead of wasting it plotting for a party dress that i certainly cant get
the expressman brought this parcel an hour ago and theres a letter for you from aunt adella on the clock shelf and i think they belong to each other
there is a bit of the wedding dress of every member of the family in it
oddly enough our birthdays fell on the same day and when penelope was twenty and i sixteen my father gave us each a silk dress of this very material
so it must be confessed did penelope though she would not have admitted it for the world
penelope saverne
i really dont think my curiosity could have borne the strain for another five minutes
she is getting discouraged over those examinations and she needs just a good jolly time to hearten her up
now she patted mrs fairweathers soft old hand affectionately
listen penelope
music for yousomebody to pet and fuss over for meand such a dear sweet aunty for us both
next year it would be easier if penelope got through her examinations successfully but just now there was absolutely not a spare penny
i think the silk once belonged to my grandmother hunter
she died six years ago and i have been so lonely since
i will tell you the whole truthi dont mind it now
i am named after her
so i am disposing of such of the family heirlooms as i do not wish to take with me
but it was very fortunate that you did it for once sister mine
my dear i am a very lonely old woman with nobody belonging to me
you must take the place of my own dear little granddaughter said aunt esther
why the wrong side is ever so much prettier than the right exclaimed penelope
the pattern is what they call little thousands isnt it
it is hard to be poor
is itit isntyes it is
penelope was four years older than i was but we were devoted to each other
i married out west and have lived there all my life
mrs fairweather who was visiting mrs anderson looked closely at it also
come now dorrie dear smooth that pucker out
what lovely old timey stuff
she wanted penelope to go to that party
it gives one a nice important family feeling
poor penelopes pretty young face turned crimson
but doris did not see how it could
doris hunter i believe its an old quilt
a little later on the knowledge came to her suddenly and she thought with inward surprise why it is doris of course
it may have been pretty once but it is all faded now
doris hunter you are a veritable little witch
it took your grandmother five years to make it
when mrs fairweather had gone doris and penelope looked at each other
its a sad thing for a body to lack brains when she wants to be a teacher isnt it
i wish she belonged to me
i have mine yet
indeed she could not have done even that much if they had not owned their little cottage
if i could only absorb algebra and history as i can music what a blessing it would be
well there is no use sitting here sighing for the unattainable she said jumping up briskly
you dont know how delighted i am to find that i have two grandnieces
it is something to possess an heirloom after all
when doris reached home the next evening she found penelope hovering over a bulky parcel on the sitting room table
she laughed a little shakily
oh very agreed penelope drolly
if your black skirt were sponged and pressed and re hung it would do very well
hurry up and find out
mrs fairweather did go to see doris the very next day and quite wonderful things came to pass from that interview
it sounds like a storybook she said gaily
the lining was certainly very pretty
doris and penelope found their lives and plans changed in the twinkling of an eye
i never knew what had become of penelope
she knew that penelope had started out to say a new dress she cut the strings and removed the wrappings
every morning when i awaken the new day seems to me to be a good fairy who will bring me some beautiful gift of joy
i want to run over and see how mrs brixby is this evening siddy and you must take care of the baby till i get back
it is the name of mr conways estatemr
i had a great deal more to sayabout your letter your big round up and your tribulations with your chinese cookbut ive only time now to say goodbye
oh jim conways place said caleb
it is six years since i was home and it seems like three times six
there was nothing sentimental hinted at or implied in the correspondence
she was a big shapeless woman with a round goodnatured facecheerful and vulgar as a sunflower was aunt jane at all times and occasions
one such request went from sidney under the pen name of ellen douglas the girl was lonely in plainfield she had no companions or associates such as she cared for the maple leaf club represented all that her life held of outward interest and she longed for something more
he had been all over the world and had seen everything everybody else had seen and everything they hadnt too i think
what should she do
i found it so fascinating too
i am
he felt that she was frightened and in trouble and he wanted to comfort and reassure her
you cant mistake it
sidney refused to lie around and take it easy
all the eastern heaven was abloom with it
as it was i had contradicted him twice and he had laughed and liked it
i am looking for the house of mr james conwaythe evergreens can you direct me to it
just beyond was another homemade gate of poles
and as a result i mean to stay a week at plainfield and come to see you every day if you will let me
then why did you write them he asked blankly
oh please go away and forgive me if you can
he talked of books and music of art and travel
all her days were alike as far as hard work and dullness went but she accepted them cheerfully and uncomplainingly
since then they had written to each other regularly
i shall go by the c p r which passes through plainfield and i mean to stop off for a day
some days later a young man stepped from the c p r train at plainfield station and found his way to the one small hotel the place boasted
can you be sidney richmondthe sidney richmond who has written to me for four years
i had a delightful run away
she never expected to meet john lincoln nor did she wish to do so
had the hotel keeper made a mistake
and when once i had begun i had to keep it up
presently he found himself before the blacksmiths forge
you will let me call and see you wont you
why did you deceive me
this is my home
then those letters
sidney hated that mirror as virulently as she could hate anything
sidney sighed and went downstairs for the baby
but his books will always have a new meaning to me henceforth through the insight he himself has given me
then home and to dinner
refuse to see him
jim conways house is just this side of it on the rightback from the road a smart piece and no other handy
i dont understand said john lincoln again
often a letter concluded with a request to the club members to correspond with the writer
i love life so much for giving me such a friendship
he was two years out from the east and had not yet forgotten to be homesick at times
it was worse than she had even thought it would be
no no never
he passed down the lane and over the little rustic bridge that spanned the brook
after all those letters were trueor rather there was truth in them
a correspondence and a climax
he wrote
we are poor everything i told you about it and my life was just imagination
that is the soul of music with all its sense and earthliness refined away
on my way home after the braddon people had left us somebody asked me how i liked paul moore
james conway explained john lincoln
you revealed yourself more faithfully in them than if you had written truly about your narrow outward life
she got out her box of paper and sat down by the little table at the window with a small kerosene lamp at her elbow
she is to me mother and sister and wise clear sighted friend
i dont understand he said perplexedly
dont do much today siddy she said kindly
please dont distress yourself so sidney he said unconsciously using her christian name
he never had done so but ellen douglass letter was so interesting that he had decided to write to her
there was nothing true in themnothing at all
after getting his supper he asked the proprietor if he could direct him to the evergreens
this monthly letter was the only pleasure and stimulant in her life
it never would have occurred to her to protest or be petulant about it
it seemed to her to typify all that was unlovely in her life
but he would find out the truth just the same she would lose his friendships and respect just as surely
just lie around and take it easy till you get rested up
im not such a dull fellow as you take me for
the gift she gave me today was my sunset gallop on my grey mare lady
at sunset sidney hurried to her room to take off the soiled and faded cotton dress she had worn while milking
this young man was certainly good at understanding
those letters made that other life seem real to me
i enjoy every one of them every minute of them
she has sympathy and understanding for my every mood
john lincolns letter was short but the pertinent paragraph of it burned itself into sidneys brain
perhaps he had meant some other james conway
i seemed to be looking into an enchanted mirror where all my own dreams and ideals were reflected back to me but made oh so much more beautiful
this is his placenobody calls it the evergreens but myself
he wrote that although his age debarred him from membership in the club he was twenty and the limit was eighteen he read the letters of the department with much interest and often had thought of answering some of the requests for correspondents
i just couldnt write you about my life here not because it was hard but it was so ugly and empty
i met another clever man a few evenings ago
the very best letter i can write in the half hour before the carriage will be at the door to take me to mrs braddons dance shall be yours tonight
yes if there is anything to forgive
yours sincerely sidney richmond
you will be weary of my rhapsodies over her
and there was no harbour or glimpse of distant sea visible
i hadnt thought about him beforei hadnt even caught his name in the general introduction
i am going east for a visit
were all lies said sidney bluntly and desperately
it was a page given over to youthful canadians and filled with their contributions in the way of letters verses and prize essays
she was afraid the child was taking something
i should have come this evening and spent an hour or so with you and then have gone away on the train tomorrow morning and that would have been all
a lot of us went for a sail on the harbour
i am sidney richmond
these last four days since your letter came have been dreadful to me
on my right was the harbour silvered over with a rising moon
he is not above talking delightful nonsense even to a girl
i wanted to ride on so forever straight into the heart of the sunset
but she did resent having to look after the baby when she wanted to write her letter
dear mr lincoln
beside it was a rickety unpainted gate opening into a snake fenced lane feathered here and there with scrubby little spruces
i think i do understand
as she slipped into her blue print afternoon dress her aunt called to her from below
four years before when sidney was sixteen still calling herself a schoolgirl by reason of the fact that she could be spared to attend school four months in the winter when work was slack she had been much interested in the maple leaf department of the montreal weekly her uncle took
the man i had been talking with was paul moore the great novelist
i never expected to meet you
john lincoln opened the gate and went up to her
i love life and its bloom and brilliancy i love meeting new people i love the ripple of music the hum of laughter and conversation
youyoull forgive me then she stammered
below in the kitchen there was a hubbub of laughing crying quarrelling children and a reek of bad tobacco smoke drifted up to the girls disgusted nostrils
and for my own part i am glad you are not what i have always thought you were
any day any hour might bring john lincoln to plainfield
so i wrote instead of the life i wanted to livethe life i did live in imagination
in the correspondence itself she found her pleasure
every word she uttered only increased my admiration of the noble creature whom i had loved and lost
pride she repeated
when my interference had restored my unworthy rival to his freedom could i submit to the degrading necessity of seeing her in his presence of speaking to her under his eyes
if he can pay a dividend to his creditors they will give him his freedom and he believes he can raise the money if i consent to insure my life
kiss me she whispered before you go
it is only your goodness that overpowers me
they are trustworthy and experienced men and i am sure they can be of use to you
i pressed her to my heart with the unacknowledged tenderness of a parting embrace
unhappily he returned to tell me of his good fortune and the same day he was arrested for debt
why need you hesitate
does speaking of him again mean speaking of his debts i asked
i am very unfortunate i seem to have innocently disturbed and annoyed you for the second time
complete the good work that you have begun she answered gratefully help me back to health
your help i exclaimed
you are quite mistaken i replied
you have forgiven me i said
hopeless infatuation
the woman in my situation must be heartless indeed who could destroy your place in the estimation of the world and the regard of your friends
cautiously as i had expressed myself her delicacy took the alarm
the snare that had been set for her was plainly revealed in those four words
is it the wrong i suffered when van brandt married me with a wife living at the time and living still
the wretchedest creature that walks the streets would shrink from treating you in that way
never
this is his position in two words a little while since he obtained an excellent offer of employment abroad from a rich relative of his and he had made all his arrangements to accept it
a helpless woman with a mock husband in prison for debt
his relative has offered to keep the situation open for a certain time and the time has not yet expired
i hardly know how to tell you she said without speaking again of mr van brandt
i dont deny it i dont excuse ithopeless infatuation
she put her hand on my mouth and stopped me before i could say any more
it is something to be your only friend
and you talk of my being your wifeknowing that
are you aware of the delays that are likely to take place before it will be possible to borrow money on your policy of insurance
i am only doubting whether your plan for relieving mr van brandt of his embarrassments is quite so simple as you suppose
am i to marry you for my food and shelter
knowing what i knew of himbelieving him as i did to be capable of any atrocityi trembled at the bare idea of what might have happened if i had failed to find my way back to her until a later date thanks to the happy accident of my position the one certain way of protecting her lay easily within my reach
my manhood had sustained me through the parting with the mother
you must have plans for the future tell me unreservedly how i can help you
yes
make me strong enough to submit to a doctors estimate of my chances of living for some years yet
bitterly as i hated the man who had parted us i loved her dearly enough to be even capable of helping him for her sake
my prospect of being married still rests with you
oh do you think i would let you give your money to van brandt she asked as soon as she could speak
in such a position as mine
you knowto my shame i confessed it to you the last time we metyou know that my heart in secret is all yours
my only friend is it possible that you think me ungrateful enough to consent to be your wife
even this negative defense of van brandt stung me to the quick
she looked at me for a moment in silent distress
you have said nothing to me about yourself she began
it was impossible to disguise the position in which i had now placed myself
to insure her life
let me tell you the plain truth
i cannot honestly say that it is i answered
what wrong are you talking of
and dont mind my crying
do you think i can ever forget the great misfortune of my lifethe misfortune that has made me unworthy of you
i rose to go while my resolution still sustained me
a doctors estimate of your chances of living i repeated
i know nothing about it she said sadly
she rose as i rosewith the tears in her eyes and the blush on her cheeks
what was there to prevent her from insuring her life if she pleased and from so disposing of the insurance as to give van brandt a direct interest in her death
there is a serious necessity for his getting out of prison
is your life a happier one than it was when we last met
for the last time i thought as i held her to me for a moment longerfor the last time
is there any prospect of your being married
he left me the little money he had with him when he was arrested she rejoined sadly
let me deserve to be forgiven
dont say that she exclaimed with an entreating look at me
i ought to have spoken more guardedly of him i said bitterly
i yieldedand spoke of it no more
how can you speak so cruelly to me she asked
dont spoil my pleasure in seeing you again by speaking of what can never be have you still to be told how it is that you find me here alone with my child
promise that you wont ask me to borrow money of you for mr van brandt she rejoined and i will accept your help gratefully
it is no fault of mine god knows but it is not the less true that i am not married and that the little darling who is playing out there with her doll is my child
my one chance of saving her lay in keeping from her knowledge the course that i had now determined to pursue
the child accepts me as her second father i said
what do you mean
will you let me ask the advice of my lawyers
love and money
feeling the embarrassment of the moment most painfully on her side mrs van brandt spoke first
i could honestly promise that
i had so to speak pronounced my own sentence of banishment
it was only when the childs round innocent little face laid itself lovingly against mine that my fortitude gave way
in the eye of the law she was of course a single woman she was of age she was to all intents and purposes her own mistress
there have been few god saviors who did not have twelve apostles or messengers
and who can number the bitter disappointments caused by such impossible promises
there has been considerable confusion and contradiction about it
how then are we to decide which of the numerous candidates for divine honors should be given our votes
the theologian might say that this little difficulty was introduced purposely into the scriptures to establish its infallibility but it is only religious books that are pronounced infallible on the strength of the contradictions they contain
but he said if ye ask anything in my name i will do it and if it were not so i would have told you did he not mean just what he said
the gospels give no date and appear to be quite uncertainreally ignorant about it
and such a faith is never free it is always maintained by the sword now and by hell fire hereafter
who were john peter judas and mary
again many of the contemporaries of lincoln bear written witness to his existence
instead of producing historical evidence or appealing to creditable documents as one would to prove the existence of a caesar or an alexander justin martyr draws upon pagan mythology in his reply to the critics of christianity
if that is what he meant why did he say something else
to help their cause the christian apologists not infrequently also changed the sense of certain old testament passages to make them support the miraculous stories in the new testament
peter paul john james judas occupy the stage almost exclusively
the number twelve like the number seven or three or forty plays an important role in all sun myths and points to the twelve signs of the zodiac
the belief that the stars determine human destinies is a very ancient one
they must be true because they are the fulfillment of old testament prophecies
then why is there discontent in the world
hence if the shepherds sleeping in the fields really saw the heavens open and heard the angel song in all probability it was in some other month of the year and not late in december
why this discrepancy in a historical document to say nothing about inspiration
that lincoln was president of these united states that he signed the emancipation proclamation and that he was assassinated can be readily authenticated
let me now give an idea of the method i propose to follow in the study of this subject
let us suppose that a student living in the year three thousand desired to make sure that such a man as abraham lincoln really lived and did the things attributed to him
and he was unknown to them because no such jesus existed in their day
the uncertainty about the apostles of jesus is quite in keeping with the uncertainty about jesus himself
there could not be a more damaging admission than this from one of the most conspicuous defenders of jesus story against early criticism
neither the place nor the time of jesus birth is known
it never struck me continues mr holyoake that the preachers threadbare dress his half famished look and necessity of taking up a collection the previous night to pay expenses showed that faith was not a source of income to him
can the followers of jesus move mountains drink deadly poisons touch serpents or work greater miracles than are ascribed to jesus as it was promised that they would do
jesus may have claimed to have been a god but is every one who puts forth such a claim a god
jesus may have been a wonderful man but is every wonderful man a god
if jesus is not real says origin then apollo was not real and the old testament prophecies have not been fulfilled
this uncertainty robs the story of jesus to an extent at least of the atmosphere of reality
they write history not stories
this is so important that we refer our readers to origins own words on the subject
have these prayers been answered
let us continue abraham lincolns associates and contemporaries are all known to history
in other words the only proofs origin can bring forth against the rationalistic criticism of celsus is that to deny jesus would be equivalent to denying both the pagan and jewish mythologies
there is absolutely no evidence that they ever existed
of course there are in history great men of whose birthplaces or birthdays we are equally uncertain
the report that jesus had twelve apostles seems also mythical
all he seems to ask for is that jesus be given a higher place among the divinities of the ancient world
but in the absence of evidence origin offers the following metaphysical arguments against the sceptical celsus one
that is precisely our position
who was matthew
but let us continue
yet there is no evidence that he was born on that day
it cannot be proved that the twenty fifth of december is his birthday
one day he went to see the rev
it is impossible to explain why the contemporaries of jesus the authors and historians of his time do not take notice of him
the twenty fifth of december is celebrated as his birthday
the report that jesus was god is equally impossible of verification how are we to prove whether or not a certain person was god
it snows in palestine though a warmer country and we know that in december there are no shepherds tending their flocks in the night time in that country
seventy wise men are supposed to have translated the old testament sitting in seventy different cells
how many self deluded prophets these extravagant claims have produced
observe to what confusion the mere attempt to follow such a report leads us
in many of the religions of the world the number twelve is sacred
if we are to have any mythology at all he seems to argue why object to adding to it the mythus of jesus
how weak must be ones case to resort to such tactics in order to command a following
the biographers of lincoln or of socrates do not seem to be interested in numbers
do you really believe asked young holyoake to the clergyman that what we ask in faith we shall receive
there has never been any unanimity about this matter
if paul was an apostle we have fourteen instead of twelve
when we come to the more important chapters about jesus we meet with greater difficulties
such expressions in our language as ill starred a lucky star disaster lunacy and so on indicate the hold which astrology once enjoyed upon the human mind
here again we see the presence of a myth
if peter ever went to rome with a new doctrine how is it that no historian has taken note of him
he was the only one who saw them
they are not mentioned except in the new testament books which as we shall see are supposed copies of supposed originals
again matthew says that to escape the evil designs of herod mary and joseph with the infant jesus fled into egypt luke says nothing about this hurried flight nor of herods intention to kill the infant messiah
but the more fervently she prayed the heavier grew the burden of her life
this ancient sun myth is the starting point of nearly all miraculous religions from the days of egypt to the twentieth century
leaving out judas and counting matthias who was elected in his place we have thirteen apostles
moreover if jesus could keep his promise there would be today no misery in the world no orphans no childless mothers no shipwrecks no floods no famines no disease no crippled children no insanity no wars no crime no wrong
yet not only is the date of his birth a matter of conjecture but also the year in which he was born
a man must have a birthplace and a birthday
the number forty figures also in many primitive myths
have not a thousand thousand prayers been offered in jesus name against every evil which has ploughed the face of our earth
a stone or wooden idol could not have been more indifferent to a mothers tears
in one or two places in the new testament jesus is made to send out the seventy to evangelize the world
george jacob holyoake of england tells how in the days of utter poverty his believing mother asked the lord again and againon her knees with tears streaming from her eyes and with absolute faith in jesus ability to keep his promiseto give her starving children their daily bread
the immediate companions of jesus appear to be on the other hand as mythical as he is himself
no no he replied raising his hand to command silence apollo is not a god he was only an idol
it was sundaysunday before christmas and the people were going to the house of god
i am not denying i said that jesus ever lived
but my guide placed his hand quickly upon my shoulder and held me back
have you seen apollo
it had only one fault interrupted my guide
no i said in a low voice
it was not true
do you doubt homer i said to him homer the inspired bard
i who had never seen a god never touched one never heard one speak i who had believed in apollo without ever having known anything provable about him i wanted to see the real god jesus
a priest of apollo i interrogated
by this time we stood at the entrance of a large edifice which my guide said was the house of god as we walked in i saw innumerable little lights blinking and winking all over the spacious interior there were besides pictures altars and images all around me
this must be a day of festival and worship devoted to one of their gods i murmured to myself
forget apollo he said with a suggestion of severity in his voice there is no such person
i want to see jesus i hastened turning toward him
do you know of any one who has
of course you are going there too i said to my friendly guide
the whole greek world will bear me witness that i am telling the truth then i looked at my guide to see what impression this outburst of sincere enthusiasm had produced upon him and i saw a cold smile upon his lips that cut me to the heart
have you touched him
would not that then i ventured to ask impatiently make jesus as much of an idol as apollo
but many of us greeks i said have felt apollo in our hearts and have been inspired by him
will he not be here this morning
homer whose inkwell was as big as the sea whose imperishable page was time
will he not permit them to touch him to caress his hand to clasp his divine feet to inhale the ambrosial fragrance of his breath to bask in the golden light of his eyes to hear the music of his immaculate accents
if you were to search for apollo in all the universe you would never find any one answering to his name or description
is he then dead i asked
then taking heart i told my guide how more than once i had felt apollos radiant presence in my heart and told him of the immortal lines of homer concerning the divine apollo
an idol i whispered taken by surprise
homer whose every word was a drop of light
he was only an idol
we gazed for a moment silently into each others eyes
i was too much surprised at this to make any immediate reply
i accepted it gratefully
when you cannot prove the existence of your god when you have never seen him nor heard his voice nor touched himwhen you have nothing provable about him he is an idol
the audience was upon its knees enveloped in silencea silence so solemn that it awed me
jesus he resumed is the son of god
he never lived and for the last two thousand years or more his temple has been a heap of ruins
but i still believe in apollo i exclaimed he is not dead i know he is alive
prove it he said to me then pausing for a moment if you produce him he said we shall all fall down and worship him
i have been dead for nearly as many years
i clasped his hand
he was an idol then and not a god
part one
he must have realized i was a stranger and wished to tender his hospitality to me
produce apollo and he shall be our god
he came to our earth and was born of a virgin
have you heard him
what was that i inquired without knowing what his answer would be
no no apollo is not an idol
he understood my bewilderment amid my novel surroundings and offered to enlighten me
they built temples to divinities which were merely empty namesempty names he repeated
and if faith that jesus is a god proves him a god why will not faith in apollo make him a god
what blasphemy
yes he answered i conduct the worship
will he not speak to his worshippers i asked again
he pressed mine
i am a priest
is it possible i asked that all this is pure fabrication a fantasy of the brain as unsubstantial as the air
let me too see jesus i pleaded
no he answered
i am today twenty five hundred years old
produce him i whispered to myself
observing my anxiety to understand the meaning of all this my guide took me aside and in a whisper told me that the people were celebrating the anniversary of the birthday of their beautiful saviorjesus the son of god
a parable
again i was tempted to tell my guide that that was how apollo became incarnate but i restrained myself
they worshipped gods that did not exist
looking about me i saw a gentleman in a neat black dress smiling and his hand extended to me with great cordiality
it will be seen from these examples that there is no harm in myth making if the myth is called a myth
my only protection is to be rationalto be truthful
the multitude is ever joined to its idols let them alone
it is then as we grow older and if i may use the word riper that we learn to distinguish between fact and fiction between history and myth
is jesus a myth
he can also invoke the authority of the church and of the christian world to enforce acceptance of his teaching
i know there are those who wish they could always remain childrenliving in dreamland
it was with the human race in its infancy as it is with the child
we can afford to be independent
religion is the science of the child
in the discussion of this subject i appeal to the mature not to the child mind
in all probability they argue there was a man called jesus who said many helpful things and led an exemplary life and all the miracles and wonders represent the accretions of fond and pious ages
before the days of science a fanciful answer was all that could be given to mans questions about the physical world
he is gods mouthpiece and no one may disagree with him
the mind craves for knowledge
but even if this were desirable it is not possible evolution is our destiny of what use is it then to take up arms against destiny
this was natural
what is a myth
our feet do not really begin to touch the firm ground until we have reached the years of discretion
the latter can command a hearing in the name of god or in the name of the bible
a myth then is a guess a story a speculation or a fanciful explanation of a phenomenon in the absence of accurate information
the childs imagination is more active than its reason
the only way i may command your respect is to be reasonable you will not listen to me for gods sake nor for the bibles sake nor yet for the love of heaven or the fear of hell
the primitive man guessed where knowledge failed himwhat else could he do
it thinks less than it guesses
we fill the space about and over us with spirits fairies gods and other invisible and airy beings
even the few who entertain doubts on the subject seem to hold that while there is a large mythical element in the jesus story nevertheless there is a historical nucleus round which has clustered the elaborate legend of the christ
myths die when history is born
observing the sun the moon and the stars overhead the primitive man wished to account for them
the school is the birthplace of science
in other words the preacher can afford to ignore common sense in the name of revelation but if i depart from it in the least or am caught once playing fast and loose with the facts i will irretrievably lose my standing
there is in man a faculty for fiction
science was born of that realization
we covet the rainbow
is jesus a myth
grown up people create science
now and then they came close enough to snap at each other
and this is precisely the use to which myths have been put
it is reflection which introduces a bit into the mouth of imagination curbing its pace and subduing its restless spirit
the child asks questions because of an inborn desire to know
man feels ill at ease with a sense of a mental vacuum until his questions are answered
in every sense the subject is an all absorbing one
this wild flight of fancy is checked only by experience
children make religions
let us place ourselves entirely in the hands of the evidence
science is the religion of the matured man
there is in this thought a world of meaning
the majority of writers assume that a person answering to the description of jesus lived some two thousand years ago
science was not born until man had matured
this was imaginary knowledge which travel and research have corrected
there is an important difference between a lecturer and an ordained preacher
we reach out for the moon
a myth is a fanciful explanation of a given phenomenon
if i do not ask the gods to help us it is because i believe in human help so much more real than supernatural help
if i do not believe in standing still it is because i believe in progress
life death truthbehold these three no power can keep back
it is not true
the world owes its emancipation to human daring
count your rightspolitical religious social intellectualand tell me which of them was conquered for you by the priest
we feel our moral fiber stiffen into force and purpose under the inspiration of a peril dared for the advancement of truth
i never deliver a lecture in which i do not either directly or indirectly give full and free expression to my faith in everything that is worthy of faith
i cannot i must share my intellectual life with the world
the truth however unwelcome is not injurious it is error which raises false hopes which destroys degrades and pollutes and which sooner or later must be abandoned
it is also a delicate one
if i do not believe in dogma it is because i believe in freedom
no man can suppress the truth
and since we are doomed to know the truth let us cultivate a love for it
i have a difficult subject in hand
it may be pleasant to play with toys and dolls all our life but evidently we are not meant to remain children always
but first let us be impersonal
in confidence
the stake
i wish to tell you something
one difficult task attempted is worth a thousand commonplace efforts completed
a difficult subject is in the nature of a challenge to the mind
truth prevails
we cannot help it
it is of no avail to cry over lost illusions to long for vanished dreams or to call to the departing gods to come back
but i am determined not only to know if it is possible the whole truth about jesus but also to communicate that truth to others
had columbus feared danger america might have slept for another thousand years
political and religious liberty were discovered through peril and struggle
if i do not say lord lord to jesus it is because i bow my head to a greater power than jesus to a more efficient savior than he has ever beenscience
if i am not attracted by the vision of a distant heaven it is because i believe in human happiness now and here
a theory of morals without proof that is mere moralising can effect nothing because it does not act as a motive
so died socrates and giordano bruno and so many a hero of the truth suffered death at the stake at the hands of the priests
if it were so virtue could be taught and by here expressing in abstract language its nature and the knowledge which lies at its foundation we should make every one who comprehends this even ethically better
he sees that the distinction between himself and others which to the bad man is so great a gulf only belongs to a fleeting and illusive phenomenon
but this is by no means the case
he therefore tries to strike a balance between them denies himself pleasures practises renunciation in order to mitigate the sufferings of others
we who here seek the theory of virtue and have therefore also to express abstractly the nature of the knowledge which lies at its foundation will yet be unable to convey that knowledge itself in this expression
when we are moved to tears not through our own suffering but through that of another this happens as follows
when now the latter becomes perfect it places other individuals and their fate completely on a level with itself and its own fate
for virtue certainly proceeds from knowledge but not from the abstract knowledge that can be communicated through words
this penetration may exist not only in the degree which is required for justice but also in the higher degree which leads to benevolence and well doing to love of mankind
thus when dogmas lead it what the man really and in general wills remains still the same
all communicable knowledge however can only affect the will as a motive
for these are careful only for themselves for their own egoism just like the bandit from whom they are only distinguished by the absurdity of their means
the merely just man is content not to cause it and in general most men know and are acquainted with innumerable sufferings of others in their vicinity but do not determine to mitigate them because to do so would involve some self denial on their part
so died codrus and leonidas and regulus and decius mus and arnold von winkelried so dies every one who voluntarily and consciously faces certain death for his friends or his country
quite in keeping with this it is reported that many hindus even rajas with great wealth expend it merely on the maintenance of their position their court and attendants and themselves observe with the greatest scrupulousness the maxim that a man should eat nothing that he has not himself both sowed and reaped
the deeds and conduct of an individual and of a nation may be very much modified through dogmas example and custom
section sixty seven
thus principally he is seized with sympathy for the lot of all mankind which is necessarily finite so that every life however aspiring and often rich in deeds must be extinguished and become nothing
false dogmas do not disturb it true ones will scarcely assist it
there are certainly individuals who merely seem to have a good disposition on account of the weakness of the will appearing in them but what they are soon appears from the fact that they are not capable of any remarkable self conquest in order to perform a just or good deed
for the interest which is extended to innumerable manifestations cannot cause such anxiety as that which is concentrated upon one
this seems to be the principal reason of the universal and thus natural weeping in the case of death
one will therefore wish to render to others as much as one receives from them
the mourner does not weep for his loss he would be ashamed of such egotistical tears instead of which he is sometimes ashamed of not weeping
yet the number of other individuals whose whole happiness or life is in danger may outweigh the regard for ones own particular wellbeing
he has only received different thoughts as to the ways in which it is to be attained and imaginary motives guide him just like real ones
and this may take place however strong and energetic in itself the will which appears in such an individual may be
a theory of morals which does act as a motive can do so only by working on self love
it would in fact be a bad look out if the cardinal fact in the life of man his ethical worth that worth which counts for eternity were dependent upon anything the attainment of which is so much a matter of chance as is the case with dogmas religious doctrines and philosophical theories
therefore we can scarcely ever pass a correct moral judgment on the action of others and very seldom on our own
thus though others have set up moral principles which they give out as prescriptions for virtue and laws which it was necessary to follow i as has already been said cannot do this because i have no ought or law to prescribe to the eternally free will
further than this it cannot go for there exists no reason for preferring the individuality of another to its own
thus genuine goodness of disposition disinterested virtue and pure nobility do not proceed from abstract knowledge
this disposition however may be quite the same when its outward manifestation is very different
the egoist feels himself surrounded by strange and hostile individuals and all his hope is centred in his own good
but this distinction is very hard to make because it lies in the heart of a man
he is now just as little likely to allow others to starve while he himself has enough and to spare as any one would be to suffer hunger one day in order to have more the next day than he could enjoy
on the other hand pure idleness and living through the exertions of others in the case of inherited wealth without accomplishing anything may be regarded as morally wrong even if it must remain right according to positive laws
in such a case the character that has attained to the highest goodness and perfect nobility will entirely sacrifice its own wellbeing and even its life for the wellbeing of many others
but in this lot of mankind the mourner sees first of all his own and this all the more the more closely he is related to him who has died thus most of all if it is his father
it is conceivable that a perfect state or perhaps indeed a complete and firmly believed doctrine of rewards and punishments after death might prevent every crime politically much would be gained thereby morally nothing only the expression of the will in life would be restricted
he recognises himself his will in every being and consequently also in the sufferer
what has been said is also confirmed by the fact that children who have been hurt generally do not cry till some one commiserates them thus not on account of the pain but on account of the idea of it
heracles watched and death came
then the light of the world went out for admetus and he heard himself speaking to apollo in a shaking voice o apollo apollo thou art a god and surely thou canst save me
go admetus
and yet heracles might be on his way from the accomplishment of some great labor and it would not be right to say a word that might turn him away from his doorway he might have much need of rest and refreshment
he could not now rejoice in the company of heracles
long had she been doing that wearisome labor admetus had known her from the first time he had come into that courtyard as a little child and he had never seen aught in her face but a heavy misery
but apollo said long ago admetus i made a bargain with the god of the underworld on thy behalf
this was heraclesheracles come to visit him but come at a sad hour
why is the house of admetus so hushed to day heracles asked
this was a feat that no hero had been able to accomplish
but still apollo stood before him with a face that was without joy
it was a pity he thought that admetus was not feasting with him
heracles after the bath put on the brightly colored tunic that the servants of admetus brought him
now the footsteps seemed to stop
raise her veil admetus said heracles
why should i not strive with death
he lifted alcestis from the bed and he carried her from the palace
there were aged men and women there servants and slaves and one of them would surely be willing to take the kings place and go with death down to the underworld
no not here for he would not have death come into the palace
to the god of the underworld said the servant
you cannot ask me to do this heracles said admetus
there she was sitting as he had first known her with her eyes bleared and her knees shaking and with the dust of the courtyard and the husks of the corn in her matted hair
and then a deeper joy than he had ever known came to admetus
then watching over her he knew that not he but alcestis would go with death
heracles would watch beside her and strive with death for her
it is for me to tell you that the god of the underworld will have you come to him
i have dragged up from the underworld he thought the hound that guards those whom death brings down into the realm of the god of the underworld
now you are held by me death cried heracles
he knew him by his lions skin and his great height
soon a flush came into the face of alcestis as heracles watched over her
a woman came with him
the sightless man with howls and shrieks said he would not go
and what a noble thing it would be to bring back this faithful woman to her house and to her husband
admetus admetus he said it is for me to tell you that you may no more look on the blue sky nor walk upon the green earth
i won her from an enemy
you are held by me and the god of the underworld will bemade angry because you cannot go about his businesseither this business or any other business
if one will go willingly in thy place with death thou canst still live on
thinking this admetus went up to heracles and took his hand and welcomed him into his house
for my sake take her into your house said heracles
she was veiled and admetus could not see her features
now take her across your threshold admetus said heracles
he came to the house of king admetus and took service with him as his herdsman
he thought that he could not bear to take her hand
then admetus went into the palace and into the chamber where his bed was and he lay down upon the bed and he lamented that he would have to go with death that was coming for him from the god of the underworld and he lamented that none of the wretched ones around the palace would take his place
thou hast been given a chance more than any mortal man
for a year apollo served the young king minding his herds of black cattle
he put a wreath upon his head and sat down to the feast
what years of happiness have been mine o apollo through your friendship for me said admetus
after that voyage and after the hunt in calydon admetus went back to his own land
afterward people wondered at admetuss ever smiling face and ever radiant being
he left the palace of admetus and he went to the temple of the gods
he went to her and spoke to her and he asked her to take the place of the king and go with death
he went toward the god and he made reverence and began to speak to him
a pang came to admetus as he looked at the woman who stood beside heracles and saw that she was the same stature as his lost wife
how noble it was of admetus to bring him into his house and give entertainment to him while such sorrow was upon him
and then heracles felt that another labor was before him
alcestis spoke to him slowly and gravely
he went back to the palace where all was silentthe servants moved about with heads bowed lamenting silently for their mistress
but apollo turned to admetus a face that was without joy
but this was only the first of many feasts
death had never been gripped by mortal hands and he strode on as if that grip meant nothing to him
it was the gods kindly thought of him that gave him such happiness
death would soon be here for her
then admetus raised the veil of the woman he had taken across the threshold of his house
a radiant figure it was and admetus knew that this was apollo come to him again
his mind was upon a great sacrifice he said and so he would not be able to feast with him
how can i look upon a womans face and remind myself that i cannot look upon alcestiss face ever again
this i cannot do said admetus
will you not take her into your house while i am away on a journey
but he treated him in friendly wise and apollo was happy whilst serving admetus
he sprang up and he took the hands of alcestis and he said you then will take my place
and then he came upon an ancient woman who sat upon stones in the courtyard grinding corn between two stones
a hand was laid upon him
and as a mortal apollo sought to earn his bread amongst men
save me now from this death that the god of the underworld is sending for me
but when she heard the name of death horror came into the face of the ancient woman and she cried out that she would not let death come near her
but heracles pleaded with him and he took her by the hand
it was not so terrible for him as before
it happened once that zeus would punish apollo his son
no more speech came from her
thou art well loved and it may be that thou wilt find one to take thy place
to what god is that sacrifice due
he looked again upon his wife brought back from the grip of death by heracles the son of zeus
and often heracles would have admetus beside him to tell him about the radiant god apollo whose bow and arrows heracles had been given
admetus admetus know that even now the god of the underworld is sending death for you
admetus heracles said when he came before him admetus there is something i would have you do for me
how is it with you friend admetus heracles asked
here is a woman whom i am bringing back to her husband
he carried her to the temple of the gods
so admetus thought as he went toward the palace
then even as admetus looked into her face he saw a pallor come upon her her body weakened and she sank down upon the bed
and the words he had spoken he would have taken backthe words that had brought her consent to go with death in his place
ah the sacrifice that the king is making said heracles
and from the dragons teeth that i sowed in the field of ares armed men sprang up
and the youths phrontis and melas were as amazed as was jason when they found out whose ship they had come aboard
begone from my sight he cried robbers that ye are
tricksters
medea was passing from her fathers house
and one fountain gushed out clear water and another gushed out milk another gushed out wine and another oil
that was on a murky night and in the morning the birds of ares shot their sharp feathers upon us
i will dare this contest monstrous as it is
and then speaking to the king in a quiet voice jason said
we have not come with such evil intent as you think
we pulled away from that place and thereafter we were driven by the winds back to the mouth of the phasis
as the dove lighted upon her shoulder she threw her veil around it and the hawk dashed itself against a column
phrontis looked at the king and said
also hephaestus the artisan of the gods was his friend and hephaestus made for him many wonderful things to be his protection
with him there came the mightiest of the heroes of greece
they had ventured from aea where they had been reared thinking to reach the country of athamas and lay claim to his possessions
as he spoke medea brought there by his messenger so that she might observe the strangers came into the chamber
but they had been wrecked at a place not far from the mouth of the phasis and with great pain and struggle they had made their way back
and it may be that i shall give you the golden fleece to bear away after i have made trial of you
for jason was the grandson of cretheus and cretheus was the brother of athamas their grandfather
jason took peleus and telamon with him
he with his comrades would subdue them for you
already he has heard of your bitter foes the sauromatae
they would help jason they said to persuade aeetes to give the golden fleece peaceably to them
then i sowed the furrows not with the seed that demeter gives but with teeth of a dragon
then phrontis and melas were some way behind
but the trial that i would make of you is hard for a great hero even know that on the plain of ares yonder i have two fire breathing bulls with feet of brass
i will face this doom
then jason utterly confounded cast his eyes upon the ground
so phrontis said but the king was not placated by what he said
all the servants rushed out
we are ready to make great recompense for the friendliness you may show to us
but if you cannot accomplish what i once accomplished you shall go from my city empty handed for it is not right that a brave man should yield aught to one who cannot show himself as brave
we will subdue for you the sauromatae or any other people that you would lord it over
telamon and peleus strode forward with angry hearts they would have laid their hands upon king aeetes only jason held them back
and then he spoke to jason saying
his heart was divided as to whether he should summon his armed men and have them slain upon the spot or whether he should put them into danger by the trial he would make of them
there we met with these heroes who were friendly to us
the mist lifted suddenly and she saw three strangers in the palace courtyard
and then a dove flew toward her it was being chased by a hawk and medea saw the hawks eyes and beak
they were in a broken ship and they had one oar only
strangers to colchis it may be true what my nephews have said
and as medea trembling leaned against the column she heard a cry from her sister who was within
one had a crimson mantle on his shoulders were such as to make him seem a man that a whole world could not overthrow and his eyes had all the suns light in them
who they are what they have come to your city for i shall now tell you
but her brows were always knit as if there was some secret anger within her
medea too his wise daughter knew the secrets taught by those who could sway the moon
the return to greece
and if you would ask of the names and the lineage of the heroes who are with jason i shall tell you
as they came to the city a mist fell and jason and his comrades with the sons of phrixus went through the city without being seen
they gushed out into golden silver bronze and iron basins
it may be that ye are truly of the seed of the immortals
and as apples that have a sweet tartness
of the pleasure and goods that we enjoy there is not one exempt from some mixture of ill and inconvenience
are there not some constitutions that feed upon it
even the laws of justice themselves cannot subsist without mixture of injustice insomuch that plato says they undertake to cut off the hydras head who pretend to clear the law of all inconveniences
socrates says that some god tried to mix in one mass and to confound pain and pleasure but not being able to do it he bethought him at least to couple them by the tail metrodorus said that in sorrow there is some mixture of pleasure
and one attalus in seneca says that the memory of our lost friends is as grateful to us as bitterness in wine when too old is to the palate
ipsa felicitas se nisi temperat premit
man is wholly and throughout but patch and motley
three twenty seven
labour and pleasure very unlike in nature associate nevertheless by i know not what natural conjunction
says tacitus
our extremest pleasure has some sort of groaning and complaining in it would you not say that it is dying of pain
we are to manage human enterprises more superficially and roughly and leave a great part to fortune it is not necessary to examine affairs with so much subtlety and so deep a man loses himself in the consideration of many contrary lustres and so many various forms
nature discovers this confusion to us painters hold that the same motions and grimaces of the face that serve for weeping serve for laughter too and indeed before the one or the other be finished do but observe the painters manner of handling and you will be in doubt to which of the two the design tends and the extreme of laughter does at last bring tears

between baring island and beecher point there are a considerable quantity of islands in the midst of ice fields the streams crowd together in the little channels which cut up this part of the sea they had a tendency to agglomerate under the relatively low temperature hummocks were formed here and there and these masses already more compact denser and closer together would soon form an impenetrable mass

the next day the sun set for the first time ending thus the long series of days with twenty four hours in them the men had ended by getting accustomed to the continual daylight but it had never made any difference to the animals the greenland dogs went to their rest at their accustomed hour and dick slept as regularly every evening as though darkness had covered the sky
the first who touches me he said brandishing a handspike hatteras approached him
there the wind turned north again and the screw was set to work
but captain replied shandon what the man says
i am of the same opinion as you johnson and if he only wanted one faithful companion
he certainly will mr clawbonny
do you hear johnson bell and simpson advanced towards the sailor who was in a terrible passion
i did said pen advancing towards the captain
beginning of revolt
they are cowards mr clawbonny those animals have no provisions as we have and are obliged to seek their food where it is to be found but sailors with a good ship under their feet ought to go to the worlds end
you hope that hatteras will succeed then
yes said he when its too late and so saying he went back to his cabin where he had stopped almost ever since his dispute with the captain
seize that man
go brunton said hatteras
if you repeat what the man says answered hatteras ill have you shut up in your cabin and guarded
at last after six days of slow navigation point beecher was sighted to the north on the first of august hatteras passed the last few hours at his masthead the open sea that stewart had perceived on may thirtieth eighteen fifty one about latitude seventy six degrees twenty minutes could not be far off but as far as the eye could reach hatteras saw no indication of it
besides he expected to be much worse off and joyfully prepared for the approaching winter
brunton made for the hatchway but before going down he stopped
hatteras returned to the poop
i am beginning not to answered wall
the stupefied engineers hesitated to go down to the machine room
on the fifteenth of august mount percy raised its peak covered with eternal snow through the mist
that pen is a wretched fellow said the doctor
ought he to treat these accounts as apocryphal or had the winter come upon him earlier
i say answered pen with an oathi say weve had enough of it and we wont go any further
wasnt i right to say the pretended discovery was purely imagination but they would not believe me and even you were against me wall
yes mr clawbonny some instinct tells them they must go and they set out
the wind veered round south towards evening hatteras ordered the brig to be put under sail and the fires to be put out the crew had to work very hard for the next few days they were more than a week getting to barrow point
shandon looked at wall
on the nineteenth of august after a pretty good observation they sighted cape franklin on the east coast and cape lady franklin on the west coast the gratitude of the english people had given these names to the two opposite pointsprobably the last reached by franklin the name of the devoted wife opposite to that of her husband is a touching emblem of the sympathy which always united them
hatteras still hoped to find an open sea beyond the seventy seventh parallel as sir edward belcher had done
the engineer followed by plover and warren went down to his post
however with the mobility that characterises the climate of these regions the sun appeared from time to time the temperature went up several degrees obstacles melted as if by magic and a fine sheet of water lay where icebergs bristled all the passes the horizon glowed with those magnificent orange shades which rest the eye tired with the eternal white of the snow
he got rather thinner but his constitution did not suffer
theres more than one amongst us who would like to imitate them i think
and stuff the stove with the masts added warren
no man has ever been nearer death answered the captain simply
do you believe in an open sea asked shandon of the lieutenant
still during the nights which followed the fifteenth of august darkness was never profound although the sun set he still gave sufficient light by refraction
the uninterrupted cracking of the ice added to the noise of the steamer was like sighs or groans
mr shandon answered hatteras calmly have that man put in irons
and what did you say asked hatteras
pieces from the ships sheathing were often rubbed off in her contact with the ice
a murmur was heard
he came down without saying a word
did you hear me cried the captain in an irritated tone
sometimes the clouds looked smooth and white as though they were reflections of the ice banks but there were entire days when the yellow rays of the sun could not pierce the tenacious fog
light the fires exclaimed some
what with asked others
we shall believe in you for the future shandon
dont go brunton called out a voice
when weve only two months coal in the hold said pen
not a word men said hatteras or that man falls dead johnson and bell disarmed pen who no longer made any resistance and placed him in the hold
the doctor by following johnsons advice accustomed himself to support the low temperature he almost always stayed on deck braving the cold the wind and the snow
who spoke cried hatteras
yes johnson answered the doctor shaking hands with the brave sailor
you shant kill us with hunger and work in the winter and they shant light the fires
at last the brig found a channel and advanced painfully along it often an enormous iceberg hindered her course for hours the fog hindered the pilots look out as long as he can see for a mile in front of him he can easily avoid obstacles but in the midst of the fog it was often impossible to see a cables length and the swell was very strong
we shall be obliged to burn the brig down to her water line answered gripper

the romans by this means erected their colonies for perceiving their city to grow immeasurably populous they eased it of the most unnecessary people and sent them to inhabit and cultivate the lands conquered by them sometimes also they purposely maintained wars with some of their enemies not only to keep their own men in action for fear lest idleness the mother of corruption should bring upon them some worse inconvenience

mr hardy has undoubtedly made an original contribution to the poetry of his time
it is false to picture him as always on his knees before the grave worm
more than this he can look forward beyond war to the coming of a new patriotism of the world
what one does bless mr hardy for however both in his verse and in his prose is his bleak sincerity
yet i feel if some one said on christmas eve come see the oxen kneel
lovers are always severed both in life and in death
his music is a still small voice unevenly matched against his consciousness of midnight and storm
especially is he sensitive to the pain and passion of frustrated lovers
he does not express life easily in beautiful words or in images
his lovers like his soldiers rot in the grave defeated of their glory
one can see how very mournful mr hardys genius is if one compares it with that of browning his master in the art of the dramatic lyric
who knows indeed
truth to tell mr hardy is neither sufficiently articulate nor sufficiently fastidious to be a great poet
and general how hold out our sweethearts sworn loyal as doves many mourn many think it is not unattractive to prink them in sable for heroes
when we as strangers sought their catering care veiled smiles bespoke their thought of what we were
is a line of good poetry
his imagination has always been curiously interested in soldiers but that is more because they have added a touch of colour to the tragic game of life than because he is on the side of the military show
how long he cries in a poem written some years ago
some fickle and fleet hearts have found them new loves
mr hardy has too bitter a sense of reality to believe much in the glory of war
christmas eve and twelve of the clock now they are all on their knees an elder said as we sat in a flock by the embers in hearthside ease
the conceptions in his novels are infinitely more poetic than the conceptions in his verse
the mood of faith howeveror rather of delight in the memory of faithis not mr hardys prevailing mood
only a man harrowing clods in a slow silent walk with an old horse that stumbles and nods half asleep as they stalk
at the same time his unfaith relates to the duration of love rather than to human destiny
take for example the use of the word domiciled in the passage in the same poem about
he has a temperament sensitive beyond that of all but a few recent writers to the pain and passion of human beings
but time to make me grieve part steals lets part abide and shakes this fragile frame at eve with throbbings of noontide
the real world to mr hardy is the world of ancient human things in which war has come to be a hideous irrelevance
in the poem which contains these verses the emotion of the poet gives words often undistinguished an almost elizabethan rhythm
browning is also a poet of frustrated lovers
it has about as much truth in it as the statement that milton was greater as a controversialist than as a poet or that lambs plays are better than his essays
it is too long to quote in full but one may give the last verses of this lyric of lovers in a lane
on the larger canvas of his prose we find a vision more abundant more varied more touched with humour
yonder a maid and her wight come whispering by wars annals will fade into night ere their story die
and our wives quoth another resignedly dwell they on our deeds deeds of home that live yet fresh as newdeeds of fondness or fret ancient words that were kindly expressed or unkindly these these have their heeds
catering care is an appalling phrase
for then i undistrest by hearts grown cold to me could lonely wait my endless rest with equanimity
intermissive aim at the thing sufficeth
his world is a place of opulence not of poverty
but what a sense of triumph there is in brownings tragedies
and prose intrudes in the choice of words as well as in images
he is not by temperament a singer
whither
in the lonely barton by yonder coomb our childhood used to know i should go with him in the gloom hoping it might be so
i do not wish to over emphasize the significance of flaws of this kind but at a time when all the world is eager to do honour to mr hardys poems it is surely well to refrain from doing equal honour to his faults
mr hardy fortunately has the genius to express the burden and the mystery even of a world grey with rain and commonplace in achievement there is a beauty of sorrow in these poems in which life with the sad seared face mirrors itself without disguise
at least half his poems i fancy are poems of frustration
we must then be grateful without niggardliness for the gift of his verse
to have loved for an hour is in mr hardys imagination to have deepened the sadness even more than the beauty of ones memories
that is one of the mild heresies in which the amateur of letters loves to indulge
they bring us face to face with an experience intenser than our own
his faith in beauty and joy may be only a thin flame but it is never extinguished
no shade of pinnacle or tree or tower while earth endures will fall on my mound and within the hour steal on to yours one robin never haunt our two green covertures
not that mr hardys is quite so miserable a genius as is commonly supposed
the day is turning ghost and scuttles from the kalendar in fits and furtively to join the anonymous host of those that throng oblivion ceding his place maybe to one of like degree
dostoevsky however has created a whole flock of these abnormal characters and watches over them as a hen over her chickens
two peasants middle aged men friends who had known each other for a long time and were not drunk had had tea and were meaning to go to bed in the same room
the novels are the perfect image of the man
love itself is with him as with strindberg and dannunzio for the most part only a sort of rearrangement of hatred
his passions are such as come before the criminal rather than the civil courts
and beyond the dark night of suffering and dissipating the night dostoevsky still sees the light of christian compassion
he took a knife and when his friend had turned away he approached him cautiously from behind took aim turned his eyes heavenwards crossed himself and praying fervently god forgive me for christs sake he cut his friends throat at one stroke like a sheep and took his watch
serve him right shouted dmitri breathlessly
madman
we sympathize indeed with the fears the bravado the despair that succeed the crime
their ups and downs are like the ups and downs in a fight between cat and dog
but it is the sensational drama of a cruel world that most persistently haunts his imagination
yet to dostoevsky such aberrations of conduct make a continuous and overwhelming appeal
scenes that in an ordinary novel would take place with two or three figures on the stage are represented in dostoevsky as taking place before a howling seething mob
mr murry will have it that the actions in the novels take place in a timeless world largely because dostoevsky has the habit of crowding an impossible rout of incidents into a single day
because they are possessed they are no longer men and women
he is a grotesque made alive by sheer imaginative intensity and passion
it is one of the triumphs of his genius that however many persons he introduces he never allows them to be confused into a hopeless chaos his story finds its way unimpeded through the mob
his work like his face bears the mark of this terrible conflict
so incongruous indeed is the sensational framework of his stories with the immense and sombre genius that broods over them that mr murry is inclined to regard the incidents as a sort of wild spiritual algebra rather than as events occurring on the plane of reality
the cry is i fancy repeated in others of dostoevskys novels
the man was not a thief he was an honest man in fact and by a peasants standard by no means poor
he may in the last analysis be a great mystic or a great psychologist but he almost always reveals his genius on a stage crowded with people who behave like the men and women one reads about in the police news
the crimes in his books seem to spring not from more or less rational causes but from some seed of lunacy
his people are possessed with devils as the people in all but religious fiction have long ceased to be
his people are energetic and untamed like cowboys or runaway horses
his work is all earthquake and eclipse and dead stars apart from this
here for example is a characteristic dostoevsky story put in the princes mouth
alyosha helped him with his slender strength holding dmitri in front
the old man moaned shrilly
he releases them from most of the ordinary inhibitions
to him dostoevskys work is the record of a great mind seeking for a way of life it is more than a record of struggle it is the struggle itself dostoevsky himself is a man of genius lifted out of the living world and unable to descend to it again
even the talk is of actions more than of ideas
nor on the other hand was he a novelist of horrors for horrors sake
his world is an inferno
one would not accept that incident from any western author
he does not mr murry urges believe as has often been said that men are purified by suffering
was very fond of hanging cats and burying them with great ceremony
dostoevskys people it is suggested are not so much men and women as disembodied spirits who have for the moment put on mortality
but the secret of dostoevskys appeal is something more than the multitude and thrill of his incidents and characters
he invents vicious grotesques as dickens invents comic grotesques
he kicked him two or three times with his heel in the face
dostoevsky was no realist
it is always lust with a knife
no melodramatist ever poured out incident upon the stage from such a horn of plenty
dostoevskys characters describe the execution of a criminal the whipping of an ass the torture of a child
if dostoevsky had had less vision he would have been strindberg
and those voices take shape in certain unforgettable fragments of dialogue that have been spoken by one spirit to another in some ugly mean tavern set in surrounding darkness
and so there is
dostoevsky the sensationalist
and yet practically all of them remain separate and created beings
this is all in a measure true
it is surely a kind of faith though a despairing kind
that is characteristic at once of dostoevskys mastery and his monstrous profusion
his people more nearly resemble madmen and wild beasts than normal human beings
as for the karamazovs themselves he portrays the old father and the eldest of his sons hating each other and fighting like brutal maniacs
they might be described as runaway human beings
if his vision had been aesthetic and sensual he might have been dannunzio
dostoevskys visible world was a world of sensationalism
he sometimes even portrays the two kinds of love in the same person
but they are never in balance they are always in demoniacal conflict
when he became excited on a certain point one could have sworn that one had seen him before seated on a bench in a police court awaiting trial or among vagabonds who passed their time begging before the prison doors
dostoevsky he declares is not a novelist
incident follows breathlessly upon incident
there was never so much talk in any other novels and there was never so much action
one does not grudge an artist an abnormal character or two
or rather both hatred and love are volcanic outbursts of the same passion
mr murry boldly faces the difficulty and attempts the definition
he does also portray an almost christ like love a love that is outside the body and has the nature of a melting and exquisite charity
in the evening i stopped for the night at a provincial hotel and a murder had been committed there the night before
they have no physical being
the face was that of a russian peasant a real moscow mujik with a flat nose small sharp eyes deeply set sometimes dark and gloomy sometimes gentle and mild
one result of this is a multiplicity of action
ivan though not so strong as dmitri threw his arms round him and with all his might pulled him away
youve killed him cried ivan
if i havent killed him ill come again and kill him
his drawn twitching features seemed to press down on his sad looking mouth eyelids lips and every muscle of his face twitched nervously the whole time
for an awful moment i seem to see things with the eye of eternity and have a vision of suns grown cold and hear the echo of voices calling without sound across the waste and frozen universe
like them he is a novelist of torture
it was another one further along that went like this
this scheme did not appeal to him
that may all be true said i but why do you tell me
after hed eaten a fair meal he fell asleep
it was like listening to one end of a telephone though we didnt know what telephones were in those days
then i scouted to see what had cut me and found that the fellow had lost a hand
if you dont like it leave it said i and get out and be damned to you
now look here said i you cant get up to day
i really think i was just in time to save the mans life
as i was bending over the fire he spoke
i saw him off and on
its all very well to say gratitude but that dont go with me
that brought him to
thats all right said i but you better stay right there
wheres my clothes he demanded again very fierce
why mate he answered its just plain gratitude
finally we compromised
i ween heem at monte off antonio curvez said he
in place of it he wore a sharp steel hook
i ran up pulling my gun
its money i got to have and its money i havent got and cant get unless i let somebody in as pardner
he was not the least bit afraid
i know he pleaded but let me see them
in the half light i could see his face change
he looked at me sideways spat and looked at me sideways again
at this moment the heavy beat of the storm on the roof ceased with miraculous suddenness leaving the outside world empty of sound save for the drip drip drip of eaves
i could mighty near furnish the replies sometimes
this was in december
or else hed just talk
there was no doubt of his being alive for he was breathing hard like a man does when he gets hit over the head
you had no coat when i picked you up i replied
and its a big thing said handy solomon to me for theys not only gold but altar jewels and diamonds
it will make us rich and a dozen like us and you can kiss the book on that
he stood there looking straight at me without winking or offering to move
on the middle of his back knelt my one armed friend and that sharp hook was caught neatly under the point of the mexicans jaw
what do you want i asked
without further delay he arose to his feet
i hadnt any more than got the words out of my mouth before he was atop me
anyway i thrust the muzzle of my colts into the sailors face
we talked the matter over at length
theyll be four of you to one of me and i dont like it and you can kiss the book on that
usually i didnt bother with his talk for it didnt mean anything but something in his voice made me turn
he sat up as though hed been touched with a hot poker stared around wild eyed and cut loose with that song you were singing
get up and give it here he demanded
at the same instant i heard the rip of steel through cloth and felt a sharp stab in my left leg
then i put my six shooter on
i want to make up to you for your trouble said he
in any case he flew poco pronto leaving me and my friend together
treasure said he
his method was a winner
then i caught sight of him quite a ways off
he looked at me mighty suspicious but didnt say anything morehe wouldnt even answer when i spoke to him
you aint fit
when a man breathes that way hes mostly all gone
its a quality with a hell of a hang fire to it
but hed been too sick and too long abed
theyre safe enough
he looked all right enough neither drunk nor loco
we had every sort of people with us off and on and as i was lookout at a popular game i saw them all
i dont know whether hed really won the coat at monte or not
and i got to have help with the treasure if its like this fellow said it was
this man has my coat he explained
just to satisfy him i passed over his old duds
i dragged him out into the light
however he didnt stay long in that frame of mind
across his forehead ran a long gash cutting his left eyebrow square in two
why dont you get your treasure without the need of dividing it
sour wine is fine to put a wound in shape to heal but its no soothing syrup
he strongly opposed this as depreciating the shares but i had no intention of going alone into what was then considered a wild and dangerous country
maybe growled the sailor
you bet he lay still
during the next two months he was a good deal about town mostly doing odd jobs
and the yaquis and cannibals from tiburon is through the country
why me i asked
he was lying on his side those black eyes of his blazing at me but now both of them saw the same distance
in a minute or so he came to
the gleam died from his eye the snarl left his lips
but it was all little stuff
he began when he was a kid and he gave his side of conversations pausing for replies
i didnt pay any attention to him for he was quiet
why not he retorted
ive been robbed he cried
when i came back that evening the bunk was empty and he was gone
he had me by the throat with his hand and i felt the point of the hook pricking the back of my neck
what do you think id want with them
for heavens sake i yelled at him whats the matter with you and your old clothes
well he was clean out of his head for nigh two weeks
he was a slim built young fellow with straight black hair long and lank and oily a lean face and big hooked nose
however i didnt pay much attention to that being at the time almighty busy holding down my card games
finally he agreed but he refused me a look at the chart saying that he had left it in a safe place
this i had tangled up with and gotten well pricked
one little squeezetalk about your deadly weapons
whats this i asked
here i pick you up on the street and save your worthless carcass and the first chance you get you try to crawl my hump
i intended to take no more chances with that hook
well it was really none of my business as you might say
that was when he was best
he nodded at me very sour and dodged around the corner of the store
now youre a nice sweet proposition said i as soon as i was sure he could understand me
how do i know you plays fair he complained
look here anderson or handy solomon or whatever you please to call yourself i rejoined to this if youre going to do business with meand i do not understand yet just what it is you want of meyoull have to talk straight
that was the worst performance of all
a third of the treasure was to go to him a third to me and the rest was to be divided among the men whom i should select
the devils a preacher if you aint lost your pinfeathers said he well its this then i got to have a boat to get there and she must be stocked
wheres my coat he asked
the brander pressed the iron smoothly against the flank
homer wooden and old california john rode in among the cattle
as the loop settled he jerked sharply upward exactly as one would strike to hook a big fish
an occasional and exceedingly husky bull yearling declined to be upset in any such manner
near the fire the horse stopped
finally homer rode over to the cattleman and reported the branding finished
seemingly but a moment later the cooks howl brought me to consciousness again
imagine a puncher descending to examine politely the ear tags of wild cattle on the open range or in a round up
in ten minutes charley pronounced the irons ready
then one or the other threw off the rope homer rode away coiling the rope as he went
unbranded calves were scarce
one hundred and seventy six he announced
behind him followed his anxious mother her head swinging from side to side
one stood waiting for them to finish a sheaf of long j h stamping irons in his hand
the first rays of the sun slanted across in one great sweep from the remote mountains
it was not forth coming
through the wide gates the cattle were urged out to the open plain there they were held for over an hour while the cows wandered about looking for their lost progeny
all the rest squatted on their heels along the fence smoking cigarettes and chatting together
the markers squatted on their heels told over the bits of ears they had saved
mr frosts bull calf alone in pictorial history shows the attitudes
in the meantime the marker was engaged in his work
you fellows drive me plumb weary remarked the rider slowly dismounting
a clear licking little fire danced in the blackness
you can imagine what happened next
by now the branding was in full swing
hot iron yelled one of the bull doggers
the brand showed cherry which is the proper colour to indicate due peeling and a successful mark
men ran to and fro busy and intent
the rest of the men arose and stretched their legs and advanced
hot irons hot language and dust filled the air
rarely did the cast fail
before it moved silhouettes of men already eating
but in the circumstance of a free range thousands of cattle and hundreds of owners any other method is out of the question
inextinguishable laughter followed the spread of this doctrine through arizona
a calf usually bellows when the iron bites but as soon as released he almost invariably goes to feeding or to looking idly about
but as i have intimated even the inevitable branding and ear marking are not so painful as one might suppose
when we arrived we found the string of ponies standing around outside
one knelt on its head and twisted back its foreleg in a sort of hammer lock the other seized one hind foot pressed his boot heel against the other hind leg close to the body and sat down behind the animal
and then of course there was the gorgeous contrast between all this frantic and uncomprehending excitement and the absolute matter of fact imperturbability of horse and rider
indeed i have never seen one even take the trouble to lick his wounds which is certainly not true in the case of the injuries they inflict on each other in fighting
sometimes three or four calves were on the ground at once
it was promptly flopped over on its right side
marker yelled the other
the critter had been caught by the two hind legs
first with a sharp knife he cut off slanting the upper quarter of one ear
i joined the cattleman and together we made our way afoot to the branding pen
toward the middle of the morning the bull doggers began to get a little tired
and that went
then he would spit on his hands and go at it alone
the calf sprang up was appropriated and smelled over by his worried mother and the two departed into the herd to talk it over
homer wrapped the rope twice or thrice about the horn and sat over in one stirrup to avoid the tightened line and to preserve the balance
the total amounted to but an hundred and seventy five everybody went to searching for the missing bit
the three ropers sat their horses idly swinging the loops of their ropes back and forth
when once you have had the wind knocked out of you or a rib or two broken you cease to think this unnecessarily rough
immediately two men ran forward
i piled out and joined the group
this is productive of some fun if it fails
no dreams visited us but in accordance with the immemorial habit of those who live outwhether in the woods on the plains among the mountains or at seaonce during the night each of us rose on his elbow looked about him and dropped back to sleep
sometimes the men rode here and there for a minute or so before their eyes fell on a pair of uncropped ears
toward noon the work slacked
that took up about half the men
this tightened the loop and prevented it from slipping off
homer was busy distributing his men for the day
a little bit of a calf like that
in a brief moment it was over
three were to care for the remuda five were to move the stray herd from the corrals to good feed three branding crews were told to brand the calves we had collected in the cut of the afternoon before
therefore the noise was deafening and the motion incessant
all that night we slept like sticks of wood
the rest were to make a short drive in the salt grass
would you like to have me tote it to you or do you reckon you could toddle this far with yore little old iron
in such case he was generally snubbed up short enough at the end of the rope but once or twice he succeeded in running around a group absorbed in branding
such good luck did not always follow however
when the nooses fell they turned and walked toward the fire as a matter of course
in a moment homer leaned forward and threw
undoubtedly it is to some extent painful and could some other method of ready identification be devised it might be as well to adopt it in preference
the bull doggers flatly refused to have anything to do with it an obvious way out would have been to flip off the loop and try again but of course that would have amounted to a confession of wrong
a smoke and the smell of scorching hair arose perhaps the calf blatted a little as the heat scorched
the three horses came and went phlegmatically
we were the only ones who did go afoot however although the corrals were not more than two hundred yards distant
no more necked calves they announced
the two bull doggers immediately pounced upon the victim
the latter counted the marks in his tally book
once in a while the rider lazy or careless or bothered by the press of numbers dragged up a victim caught by the neck
this matter satisfactorily adjusted the men all ran for their ponies they had been doing a wrestlers heavy work all the morning but did not seem to be tired
nobody paid any attention to the calf
theres yore little calf said he
cries arose in a confusion marker hot iron tally one dust eddied and dissipated
but if the calf gave much trouble then all work ceased while the unfortunate puncher wrestled it down
between the upright bars of greasewood we could see the cattle and near the opposite side the men building a fire next the fence
he had distinctly begun to love nichola and he felt sick and almost resentful
they talked over the days news and then an organ began to grind outside
how that chestnut hair of hers had shone it required no tiara to set it off like that of the dowager he had seen there who had put ten thousand pounds upon her head to make herself look worse than she would have appeared with the ninepenny muslin cap of a servant woman
no i shall not care to come again he answered in a tone inaudible to the young ladies
he determined to call immediately on the new incarnation
now ill tell you all about it said he gravely
the spring in the present case was the artistic commendation she deserved and craved
the lady on jocelyns left wife of a lord justice of appeal was in like manner talking to her companion on the outer side so that for the time he was left to himself
but happily his affection was incipient as yet and a sudden sense of the ridiculous in his own position carried him to the verge of risibility during the scene
dont you feel lonely in it sometimes
so he dined on catching her eyes and the few pretty words she made opportunity to project across the table to him now and then
she signified a chair and began the critical study of some rings she wore
she looked very charming between the candles and then suddenly it dawned upon him that her previous manner must have originated in some false report about marcia of whose existence he had not heard for years
as the other guests dropped in the pair retreated into a shady corner and she talked beside him till all moved off for the eating and drinking
how i wish i could run after him
good bye said pierston
he was now over forty she was probably thirty and he dared not make unmeaning love with the careless selfishness of a younger man
but was he able
he was courteously responsive only but mrs pine avon herself distinctly made advances
o never
she had been the first arrival
it was unfair to go further without telling her even though hitherto such explicitness had not been absolutely demanded
now what the devil this means i cannot tell he said to himself reflecting stock still for a moment on the stairs
yes i have had my house some years she observed complacently and i like it better every year
but jocelyn was receding from the pretty widows house with long strides
yes
o didnt he marry her said mrs pine avon with a start
he had not been appointed to take her across to the dining room but at the table found her exactly opposite
to be sure it was mrs nichola pine avon but frosted over indescribably
when shortly after eleven he came away he felt almost certain that within those luminous grey eyes the one of his eternal fidelity had verily taken lodgingsand for a long lease
but somehow the very bell pull seemed cold although she had so earnestly asked him to come
they were round inquiring luminous
as the house spoke so spoke the occupant much to the astonishment of the sculptor
but this was not all
but the end of the letter was what arrested him
you will be sorry to hear sir that dear little avice caro as we used to call her in her maiden days is dead
she followed him to the door
you would find this is often done with excellent effect
and yet the meaning was staring him in the face
he went out very little during the next few days but about a week later he kept an engagement to dine with lady iris speedwell whom he never neglected because she was the brightest hostess in london
it is based on a sound old melody called the jilts hornpipe just as they turn madeira into port in the space of a single night so this old air has been taken and doctored and twisted about and brought out as a new popular ditty
she asked him to come again and he thought he would tell the truth
afterwards they kept apart awhile in the drawing room for forms sake but eventually gravitated together again and finished the evening in each others company
anyhow he was not disposed to resent an inexplicability in womankind having found that it usually arose independently of fact reason probability or his own deserts
he had his doubts
she was in a word willing to go on
indeed
having hardly a correspondent in that part of the world now he began to conjecture on the possible sender
it is rather uncivil
jocelyn pierston
pierston drew it sufficiently forth to observe by the post mark that it came from his natal isle
what an uncivil thing to say she murmured in surprise
meanwhile one of the three young ladies had said what interesting man was that with his lovely head of hair
i saw him at lady channelcliffes the other night
this climax of the series had been reached to night on the aforesaid moor and for the first time in the season its irregularities were forms without features suggestive of anything proclaiming nothing and without more character than that of being the limit of something elsethe lowest layer of a firmament of snow
this was followed by a voice from the same quarter
i dont like to come to the barracks
it smacked against the wall at a point several yards from its mark
what then
do we
the shape went slowly along but without much exertion for the snow though sudden was not as yet more than two inches deep
yes
the river would have been seen by day to be of that deep smooth sort which races middle and sides with the same gliding precision any irregularities of speed being immediately corrected by a small whirlpool
dont speak like that
dont cry now
here the spot stopped and dwindled smaller
it was a night when sorrow may come to the brightest without causing any great sense of incongruity when with impressible persons love becomes solicitousness hope sinks to misgiving and faith to hope when the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret at opportunities for ambition that have been passed by and anticipation does not prompt to enterprise
it was a neighbouring clock striking ten
i dont quite recollect
i did not expect you to night
not to morrow
it weighs me to the earth
the throw was the idea of a man conjoined with the execution of a woman
welli said that you might
can youcome to me
yesso am i and frank when will it be
there are bad women about and they think me one
below down to the waters edge the flat was unbroken by hole or projection
forgive me
then i shant see you till then
ill go away now
five
your wife fanny robin
wellyou have to get proper clothes
dont dear frankwill youfor i love you so
between each utterance the little shape advanced about half a dozen yards
how did you get here from weatherbury
i am orderly to morrow
oh frankdont you know me said the spot
that you promised
yesyesit is
to morrow
the scene was a public path bordered on the left hand by a river behind which rose a high wall
one
on the right was a tract of land partly meadow and partly moor reaching at its remote verge to a wide undulating upland
for dreariness nothing could surpass a prospect in the outskirts of a certain town and military station many miles north of weatherbury at a later hour on this same snowy eveningif that may be called a prospect of which the chief constituent was darkness
the tones were masculine and not those of surprise
the bell was in the open air and being overlaid with several inches of muffling snow had lost its voice for the time
still to a close observer they are just as perceptible the difference is that their media of manifestation are less trite and familiar than such wellknown ones as the bursting of the buds or the fall of the leaf
banns i should think
i asked which was your window
this was all that was positively discoverable though it seemed human
o you do
will it be by banns or license
the bugle has sounded the barrack gates are closed and i have no leave
the indistinct summit of the facade was notched and pronged by chimneys here and there and upon its face were faintly signified the oblong shapes of windows though only in the upper part
at this time some words were spoken aloud
what
and the noise was again heard of a window closing
indeed i did not think you would come at all
whos there
oh yesof course
yes said the girl with a half suppressed gasp of emotion
not long after a form moved by the brink of the river
yes i mean that i might
and we live in two parishes
we are all of us as good as in the county gaol till to morrow morning
this person was so much like a mere shade upon the earth and the other speaker so much a part of the building that one would have said the wall was holding a conversation with the snow
many are not so stealthy and gradual as we may be apt to imagine in considering the general torpidity of a moor or waste
how did you come here
what girl are you
my dear fan no
fanny said the wall in utter astonishment
good night
it makes me say what ought to be said first by you
is that the law
o must iit is when shall we be married frank
quite so
no not yet
the fact is i forgot to ask
never mindsay it
you said i was to come
by its outline upon the colourless background a close observer might have seen that it was small
i have money
it is foolish
you said you almost had before you left casterbridge
an indescribable succession of dull blows perplexing in their regularity sent their sound with difficulty through the fluffy atmosphere
is it sergeant troy said the blurred spot in the snow tremulously
i walkedsome part of the waythe rest by the carriers
good night frankgood night
well settle in a few days
i am surprised
three
then a morsel of snow flew across the river towards the fifth window
if i said so of course i will
outside the barrackssnowa meeting
you have the permission of the officers
yes came suspiciously from the shadow
the little spot moved away
if they would put out their hands to him why should he refuse to put out his own
pride in him might be as weak as pride in them
i know youll be ashamed of me and then we shall both be unhappy
and i must have a pair of gloves and a black coat
but you must go also
she looked wistfully up into his face
two letters were written accepting the invitation
things arrange themselves
the husband should be to her in all respects the first and foremost
the countess lovel presents her compliments to miss lovel
if you really wish it you shall go he said
my dear lord
you shall if you like and ill make it for you
i can do that too
i dont see why you shouldnt hold up your head with any man in england said lady anna
would you not desire wealth in order that you might be assisted by it in your views of ambition
this reply was received at yoxham three days before any answer came either from lady anna or from the tailor
and so i oughtbut i shouldnt
i quite agree with you that the silk gowns should be kept for their elders and so the conversation was ended
it is one to which all legislative and all human efforts should and must tend
pardon me
the theory of equality is very grand
no one shouldunless i be mean and despicable
the grandest thing in the world sir william
but they doyou may be sure
with her there was a real wish that the poles might be joined together by her future husband
not so replied sir william
when you make much water boil mr thwaite some of it will probably boil over
i will never be ashamed of you
but you cant make me like a lord or think that a young man ought to wear a silk gown
but the countess never gave way an inch
i will go said he
yesfor one day
they cant but despise me you know said the tailor
the subject is so large that i should like to discuss it with you when we have more time
daniel thwaite
and a blue oneto be married in
when you were a workman among workmen did you not wish to be their leader
it was a matter that required to be considered
they were poles asunder if you will but by your good fortune and merit if you will allow me to say so you have travelled from the one pole very far towards the other
what does it all signify if you are not happy
the tailor must behave himself properly said lady anna
i will be ashamed of them if they are not good to you
why should the children of lords be such to the tenth and twentieth generation
would you like to go to yoxham he said
if mayor would you not wish to be its representative in parliament
the countess disapproves altogether of the marriage which is about to take place between lady anna lovel and mr daniel thwaite and will take no part in the ceremony
must i have a pink silk gown to walk about in early in the morning
i should not know how to drink wine with them and should do a hundred things which would make them think me a beast
they are cousins you know said lady anna
i wont be ashamed of you
not the less do i feel your courtesy and i am
it is only human nature that they should
as when one man throws away forty thousand a year on race courses
on the following day lady anna was with him as usual for the pretext of his wound still afforded to her the means of paying to him those daily visits which in happier circumstances he would naturally have paid to her
she was much obliged she said to the rector for his goodness in promising to marry them and as she had no friends of her own she hoped that minnie lovel would be her bridesmaid
if you were a master tradesman would you not wish to lead and guide your brother tradesmen
when you were foremost among them did you not wish to be their master
but if the cousins were willing to accept her husband why should he not be willing to be accepted
with all sincerity your lordships very obedient servant
we are made of different fabricthough the stuff was originally the same
and there was a little girl there i loved so much
but could you establish absolute equality in england to morrow as it was to have been established in france some half century ago the inequality of mens minds and character would reestablish an aristocracy within twenty years
i cannot and so you have the best of me
when two men run a race some strength must be wasted in fruitless steps beyond the goal
she persisted in the determination to go on to london by an early morning train and he therefore offered advice on lesser matters only in that case he said you must go up to your room and send down your things that they may be dried by the fire immediately or they will not be ready
my fathers is a comparatively humble residence hard by
it would be too awkward for you to go there alone
i have left my father for ever
oh but you know meabout me at least
the thing had not however taken place and he went on thinking how soft and warm the lady was in her fur covering as he held her so tightly the only dry spots in the clothing of either being her left side and his right where they excluded the rain by their mutual pressure
i will tell the servant to do this and send you up something to eat
jocelyn thought it strange that he should be thrown by fate into a position to play the son of the montagues to this daughter of the capulets
i must sit here till it stops
he hoped nothing serious had happened to drag her out at such an untoward time
if you ever do in this hurricane
he felt ravenously hungry himself and set about drying his clothes as well as he could and eating at the same time
into it they plodded without pause crossing the harbour bridge about midnight wet to the skin
after making over his large business to the company he retired i believe to london
my train has gone
ill return with you
they crouched so close to each other that he could feel her furs against him
i am sorry i should have spoken so disrespectfully of him for i never knew him personally
quantities of sea water trickled through the pebble wall and ran in rivulets across their path to join the sea within
the ethereal substance closed not long divisible
the maid servant knelt down before the blaze and held up with extended arms one of the habiliments of the juno upstairs from which a cloud of steam began to rise
neither had spoken since they left the roadway till she said with attempted unconcern this is unfortunate
but as the rain gave not the least sign of cessation he observed i think we shall have to go back
however if you are determined i will show you the way
but loving her or not he perceived that the spirit emanation idealism which called itself his love was flitting stealthily from some remoter figure to the near one in the chamber overhead
the island was an island still
you are sleepy my girl said pierston
he did not think of her as before
by the aid of some temporary wraps and some slippers from the cupboard he was contriving to make himself comfortable when the maid servant came downstairs with a damp armful of womans raiment
the rain fell upon the keel of the old lerret like corn thrown in handfuls by some colossal sower and darkness set in to its full shade
at first she seemed not at all disposed to show any candour on her own affairs and he was left to conjecture as to her history and name and how she could possibly have known him
i should think so
hes my father
he pitied her and while he wondered at it admired her determination the houses facing the bay now sheltered them completely and they reached the vicinity of the new railway terminus which the station was at this date without difficulty
our house or rather his not mine is at south kensington
he again became conscious of the change which had been initiated during the walk
pierston withdrew from the fire
avice had not kept her engagement to meet him in the lonely ruin fearing her own imaginings
it is more unfortunate for you perhaps than for me he said and i am very sorry that it should be so
i am a real islanderor was rather
now i shall take the train as soon as i reach the mainland
first he gave his arm but the wind tore them apart as easily as coupled cherries
yes
it meant a possible migration of the well beloved
my father she burst out suddenly is always scolding me for my extravagance
rain or no rain i can stay no longer she said
never said she and the firmness with which she closed her lips was audible in the word
we have lived there for years
indeed
i am not
why not he inquired
he admitted that it was and found after a few further remarks had passed that she certainly had been weeping there being a suppressed gasp of passionateness in her utterance now and then
how should i you are a kimberlin
yes
and he has been doing it to day more than ever
havent you heard of the best bed stone company
they had not realized the force of the elements till now
she replied nothing to this and he added that it was rather a desolate place for a woman alone and afoot
but we have been tenants of sylvania castle on the island here this season
nothing but the frail bank of pebbles divided them from the raging gulf without and at every bang of the tide against it the ground shook the shingle clashed the spray rose vertically and was blown over their heads
then i have been staying quite near you miss bencomb
there are good reasons
i dont know
he doesnt tell me much of his affairs
they passed the ruined castle and having left the island far behind them trod mile after mile till they drew near to the outskirts of the neighbouring watering place
the well beloved was moving househad gone over to the wearer of this attire
then jocelyn opened proceedings overhauling the robes and extending them one by one
the night porter thanked him and left the room and he soon heard her snoring from the adjoining apartment
somewhere about this timeit might have been sooner it might have been laterhe became conscious of a sensation which in its incipient and unrecognized form had lurked within him from some unnoticed moment when he was sitting close to his new friend under the lerret
but he could afford a much bigger one if he chose
do come back said he taking her hand
her clothing offered more resistance to the wind than his and she was consequently in the greater danger
their application for admission led to the withdrawal of a bolt and they stood within the gaslight of the passage
ill dry the clothing and put the articles here in a heap which you can take up to the young lady in the morning
was that this evening
i cannot leave you
twill have no effect said my father
ill put him however into breeches said my fatherlet the world say what it will
i would shew him publickly said my uncle toby at the market cross
was ever poor devil of a country gentleman so hampered said my father
that paper i sent to mr trenchard is accepted and i shall be glad to have your criticism when it comes out dont spare my style which needs a great deal of chastening
if you cant see me at least let us write to each other
dearest marian do not cease to think of me as your friend because my brother has disgraced himself
i have been thinking couldnt you use your holiday in sark for a story
for the present we cannot see each other but i am very far from wishing that our friendship should come to an end
it was written with undisturbed kindness of feeling but in few words
several days passed before there came a reply
and much more of the same tenor
dresden echoed polly sitting quite straight with very red cheeksoh jasper
but up came another boy
thats my third letter polly announced jasper on the other side of the table now i am going to begin on joels
mr king thought so too and he beamed at phronsie
and hurry cried polly and jasper together after him
tom see here
all right said polly glad to think there was anything she could really do to please the little old earl but would your mother like it tom she stopped slowly in putting her unfinished letter into the little writing case and looked at him
twenty four
shes got lots of fun in her and she always sees the sense of a thing
then his face brightened and he said and shes right polly while polly fished a franc out of joels little money bag that hung at her belt
oh tom selwyn gasped polly looking up over phronsies head you dont suppose wed let that letter go
but shes so nice breathed polly who greatly admired mrs selwyn and so elegant
he took it out said adela for the first time finding her tongue
and then to post it
that night in the market place at martigny jasper who was ahead with his father ran back to polly and the others lingering behind
i wouldnt feel so badly polly he managed to whisper when phronsie was absorbed with her work hell like it probably just as father did the gingerbread boy
o dear me cried polly aghast
and she gave the bag a little pat for joels sake wishing it was his stubby black hair that her fingers could touch
tom selwyn had been very sober during all this merry chatter and now in his seat across the narrow aisle he drummed his heels impatiently on the floor
the very thing exclaimed tom striking his hand so heavily on the table that for a minute it looked as if the ink bottle hopped
phronsie who hadnt heard what polly said her small head being full of the responsibility of beginning the important letter and considering since it was to be done it was best to have it over with as soon as possible fell to scribbling the letters as fast as she could all of them running down hill
i really would phronsie dear to please her
o dear my stamps are all gone said polly peering into the little box in one corner of her writing case
toms mouth trembled
you know she did jasper
just look at her face
o dear me exclaimed adela as her scissors slipped now youve joggled the table again then she caught pollys eye
now phronsie i think you would better begin for you are the littlest and she flapped the long strip down in front of her
whats up little mother asked tom in surprise at her unusual manner
and jasper running in the table was soon surrounded by the makers of the round robin adela deserting her sketch book and pulling up a chair
dear me how the summer is going mourned polly as they caught on the return journey the last glimpse of the roaring tumbling visp and not all the craning of the necks could compass another view as the cars drew them away from the rushing river
dare said tom delighted to think that no terrible result had really ensued from his words that after they were out had scared him mightily
when the news was circulated as it was pretty soon that the party was not to be broken into at all till paris was a completed story the jubilation was such as to satisfy even tom
and lets get to work cried jasper huddling up his three letters ill post yours too polly give them here
rather notmuch obliged tom bobbed his thanks
see those boys now they are going to make trouble
the louvre cried adela o dear me polly pepper
phronsie there there dont cry
tom bobbed his head and accepted this as a matter of course
see polly she was trimming the third strip of paper for the round robin was to be pasted together and rolled up when it was all done
tom bobbed his head not allowing himself to exclaim but that will be only a short journey now and we must soon say good by
its all right
then i shall be all as well as ever said polly kissing the wet little face
i want to write too i do she cried very much excited
ever so much like it said tom
it isnt borrowing said jasper turning back slowly
of course you shall pet
but that was different groaned polly
im going to write you one now declared phronsie
but i didnt say round robin persisted tom wasnt smart enough to think of it
and jasper and polly rushed up to date with their journals and wrote letters home and adela worked up her studies and sketches
all right seeing you wish it so said jasper with a keen look at him and these are beauties and no mistake we couldnt begin to equal them
yes she did said jasper uncomfortably
why said polly finding her tongue we wouldnt dare tom selwyn
i dont see how you got so many said jasper in admiration his fingers busy with the heap
im glad we have any hummed polly happily
when the letter was finally unrolled and read to grandpapa who strayed into the reading room to see what phronsie was doing it certainly was a beauty
isnt it nice to think they do
picture after picture cut from railroad guide books illustrated papers and it seemed to jasper gathered as if by magic with cunning little photographs broke up the letter and wound in and out with funny and charming detail of some of their journey
arent those pictures pretty she burst out awkwardly
oh polly you begin begged tom
ill give them to you polly
its dreadfully thin paper said adela critically getting off from the sofa to pick at one corner of the sheet polly was beginning to divide
but polly wants you to said jasper
thats the very reason she understands things like a shotand knows how to take em he said and i tell you polly he declared with a burst of confidence that utterly surprised him id rather have my mother than any other company i know of shes awful good fun
its just this tom
polly looked up quickly her pen dropping from her fingers and jasper deserted his fourth letter and stared
thank your stars you have said tom as gaily
and youll go on drawing and painting until you get to be a great artist ran on polly enthusiastically and then well see something youve done in the louvre maybe
filched em out of the old womans room he said
oh do hurry he begged its the prettiest sight
we might said polly slowly write a letter all of us
do you please finish it jasper
at that polly began to have little creeps as she always called the shivers
never you fear cried tom seizing the round robin and waving it over his head it trailed off back of him like a very long and broad ribbon
any room here tom for mother she said
but the ring of girls paid no more attention to him than they had to any other outside matters being wholly absorbed in the game
i wrote that all myself hummed phronsie smoothing her gown in great satisfaction pointing to the opening of the letter
so you did he cried now thats fine
i wont cry any more declared phronsie wiping off the last tear trailing down her nose
oh tom began polly
the round robin
i want to donate something to granddaddy and i tell you im something awful at a letter
phronsie lifted her head where she had burrowed it under pollys arm when she saw that pollys round cheeks were really quite pale she stopped crying at once
but mamsie said when we started i should get my stamps when i needed them said polly
now this is comfy observed mrs selwyn as the train sped on
and the urchin laughed too thinking this much better fun to tussle with the tall lad than to hang around a parcel of girls
hes got lots of fun in him he added
take care cried jasper as he ran after with polly and adela if you dare to tear that sir while phronsie at the big table laboured away on her letter grandpapa sitting by to watch the proceedings with the greatest interest
i wish youd write me a letter sometime
o dear me i cant cut it straight
there in the centre of the market place was a ring of little girls hand in hand singing a little french song and going round and round in a circle
no i think phronsie ought to said polly shaking her head
yes i do said adela and ive got some sketches to take back and mademoiselle will be glad of that
o dear me exclaimed polly softly for she couldnt even yet get over that dreadful beginning
oh no jasper cried polly after him you know mamsie would not allow me to borrow
thats three times that boy has gone out announced adela and he joggles the table awfully when he starts
one two said polly counting why i thought id written three well this one is most finished jasper
oh if you knew granddaddy and he sank into a chair by the table and played with the heap of picture postal cards that polly was going to address next
it will cheer him up
i would said tom coolly running his hands in his pockets
and then it struck me id make a book like yours
well lets leave our letters to day polly and set to on the round robin
o dear me how could i say anything cried polly overcome with remorse and patting phronsies yellow hair but it is so very dreadful
well im sorry the summer is going said adela because then ive got to leave you at paris and go into school
i want polly to said phronsie wriggling away from the pen that polly held out alluringly
hear them jeer and his long arm went out and picked a jacket end of an urchin who incautiously regarding such quiet travellers as not worth minding had hovered too near while trying to tease the girls
you dont know my mother exclaimed tom if you think she wont like that
ill fetch phronsie cried tom springing off
when number three put in an appearance she gave up all hope at once
and phronsie must come said polly snipping away to get the paper the right width
o dear me she exclaimed again and turned quite pale
i know ejaculated tom whirling on his heel and dashing out
oh isnt it oats peas beans and barley grow cried polly as they watched them intently
thats all right said jasper squinting at it critically onlyjust this edge wants a little bit of trimming polly and he snipped off the offending points
she spoke so sharply that phronsie started and a little drop of ink trembling on the point of her pen concluded to hop off
theyre jealous chaps cried tom and are vexed because they cant get into the game
o dear me
come on now all fall into line
oh see what shes written cried polly quite aghast and tumbling into her chair she pointed at the top
do cried old mr king in great satisfaction
so we could cried jasper how would that do tom
well im glad to see that we havent made any mistake cried polly turning back in relief
then she thought of what mamsie had said and slackened her speed
im no good in a letter and again he rushed from the room
i know it said polly brightly with a little answering smile well i hope shell like it
wait a minute phronsie exclaimed polly in dismay i believe weve made a mistake jasper and got the wrong sheet and polly turned off with him to examine the rest of the paper
polly you always do think of the best things exclaimed jasper beaming at her which made her try harder than ever to smile
are you sick polly she asked in great concern
then you can overcome your dislike to paris enough to go there asked his mother with a little twinkle in her eye
o dear me
to please polly being what phronsie longed for next to pleasing mamsie she gave a small sigh and took the pen in unsteady fingers
so polly and the others breathed freely again
and he made me cut clear into that edge
ive plenty said jasper hurrying off ill stick on two for you
my mother says he announced in triumph that father will get no end of fun over that if you let it go
and one look at mrs selwyns face as she read that round robin was enough for polly
since grandpapa wanted anything it was never too soon to begin work on it
oh phronsie you havent begun
in came tom with a rush and turned a small box he held in his hand upside down on the table
that man stands before you
he got laws passed for them he got sunday schools established wherever he could
so this poor little boy grew up to be a man and had to go out in the world far from home and friends to earn his living
elderly people directed each others attention and said there thats him with the grand noble forehead boys nudged each other and said hi johnny here he is there thats him with the peeled head
always love your teachers my children for they love you more than you can know now
when senator dilworthy departed from cattleville he left three dozen boys behind him arranging a campaign of life whose objective point was the united states senate
that poor little boy that loved his sunday school became that man
chapter fifty three
no
no
am i in some strange foreign clime where the children are marvels that we know not of
no
they all made complimentary reference to their friend the senator and told what a great and illustrious man he was and what he had done for his country and for religion and temperance and exhorted the little boys to be good and diligent and try to become like him some day
the senator now turned his attention to matters touching the souls of his people
i ask you my little friends what did my consciousness reply
it replied it is the temple of the lord
when the senator arrived the church was crowded the windows were full the aisles were packed so was the vestibule and so indeed was the yard in front of the building
well this poor little boy was always in his place when the bell rang and he always knew his lesson for his teachers wanted him to learn and he loved his teachers dearly
above all things my children be honest
no
then he smiled with an access of sweetness upon the children and began
after mr noble was gone the senator said
by and by he was elected to the legislaturethen he did everything he could for sunday schools
after a while the people elected him a representative to the congress of the united states and he grew very famousnow temptations assailed him on every hand
is it some other vain brilliant beautiful temple of soul staining amusement and hilarity
again i thought is this a theatre
children honor your parents and be grateful to them for providing for you the precious privileges of a sunday school
the senator wrought in bible classes and nothing could keep him away from the sunday schoolsneither sickness nor storms nor weariness
he loved the sunday school
and i humbly thank him to whom we are but as worms of the dust that he has been pleased to call me to serve such men
by supper time to morrow youll be reelected
you can go to bed and sleep easy on that
temptations lay all about him and sometimes he was about to yield but he would think of some precious lesson he learned in his sunday school a long time ago and that would save him
what did my consciousness reply
that is right
there was one little bad boy who was always trying to persuade him but he never could
senator dilworthy thought he would run out west and shake hands with his constituents and let them look at him
the session was drawing toward its close
no
he finally sent the man away at three oclock one morning and when he was gone mr dilworthy said to himself
and by and by the people made him governorand he said it was all owing to the sunday school
the sunday school children occupied ten of the front benches dressed in their best and most uncomfortable clothes and with hair combed and faces too clean to feel natural
the university bill was safe now he could leave it without fear it needed his presence and his watching no longer
is it a concert or a gilded opera
i feel a good deal relieved now a great deal relieved
and what do you think it was
the usual sunday school exercises were hurried through and then the minister got up and bored the house with a speech built on the customary sunday school plan then the superintendent put in his oar then the town dignitaries had their say
i have been asking myself as i sat here where am i am i in some far off monarchy looking upon little princes and princesses
then what is it
he would not let bad boys persuade him to go to play on sunday
the senator took his seat in the pulpit with the minister on one side of him and the superintendent of the sunday school on the other
mr dilworthy took an early opportunity to send for mr noble he had a midnight interview with him and urged him to forsake his evil ways he begged him to come again and again which he did
then where am i yeswhere am i i am in a simple remote unpretending settlement of my own dear state and these are the children of the noble and virtuous men who have made me what i am
why the people gave him a towering illustrious position a grand imposing position
above all things be pure minded as the snow
earth has no higher no grander position for me let kings and emperors keep their tinsel crowns i want them not my heart is here
after that they began to come to themselves by degrees and presently the spell was wholly gone and they were reciting verses and pulling hair
am i in some populous centre of my own country where the choicest children of the land have been selected and brought together as at a fair for a prize no
it was senator of the united states
i could hardly keep the tears back i was so grateful
to them a united states senator was a vast vague colossus an awe inspiring unreality
he further said that if this noble were a pure man and merely misguided he could bear it but that he should succeed in his wicked designs through a base use of money would leave a blot upon his state which would work untold evil to the morals of the people and that he would not suffer the public morals must not be contaminated
noble was working hard too but matters were against him he was not making much progress
people tried to get him to drink wine to dance to go to theatres they even tried to buy his vote but no the memory of his sunday school saved him from all harm he remembered the fate of the bad little boy who used to try to get him to play on sunday and who grew up and became a drunkard and was hanged
let us join in prayer
so awed were they by the presence of a living united states senator that during three minutes not a spit ball was thrown
ive worked hard and ive got them at last
they could not give him a costly education but they were good and wise and they sent him to the sunday school
the speakers won the deathless hatred of the house by these delays but at last there was an end and hope revived inspiration was about to find utterance
my soul is lost in wonder at the thought
well at last what do you think happened
the legislature whose duty it would be to re elect him to the united states senate was already in session
what should you say it was children
they were just going to turn away but they didnt for that angry thump happened to be the best thing they could have done
the mother had died not long ago and left twelve year old tessa to take care of the little children
freddy bring me your mittens these poor hands must be covered
tessa felt very rich as she crept under the faded counterpane feeling as if she had received a lovely gift and fell happily asleep with chubby ranza in her arms and the two rough black heads peeping out at the foot of the bed
i like this very much and now it is not hard
what happy little souls they were that morning and when they were quiet again how like a fairy tale did tessas story sound to them ranza was quite ready to be an angel and the boys promised to be marvellously good if they were only allowed to see the tree at the palace as they called the great house
mamma says come to the door its too muddy to throw the money into the street cried out a kindly childs voice as tessa held up the old cap with beseeching eyes
all of a sudden a little head appeared at the window as if the sound had brought it then another and another till there were five of all heights and colors and five eager faces peeped out smiling and nodding to the two below
but she had made half a dollar for tommo divided the money fairly and she felt rich with her share
tommo will like to have me go with him and sing while he plays his harp in the streets
she dreamed wonderful dreams that night and woke in the morning to find real wonders before her eyes
it was a happy night and all their lives they remembered it as something too beautiful and bright to be quite true
quick quick cried tommo twanging away with all his might and showing his white teeth as he smiled back at the little gentle folk
just as tessas tears began to tumble off her eyelashes on to her brown cheeks the cricket began to chirp
she tried to be very wise and motherly and worked for them like any little woman but it was so hard to keep the small bodies warm and fed and the small souls good and happy that poor tessa was often at her wits end
four socks instead of three and by the fourth pinned out quite elegantly was a little dress evidently meant for hera warm woollen dress all made and actually with bright buttons on it
but see then it is cold in the streets the wind bites and the snow freezes ones fingers
i assure you it was splendid the great tree glittering with lights and gifts and on her invisible perch up among the green boughs sat the little golden haired angel all in white with downy wings a shining crown on her head and the most serene satisfaction in her blue eyes as she stretched her chubby arms to those below and smiled her baby smile at them
my mother
in her long stocking she found all sorts of treasures for tommo had stuffed it full of queer things and his mother had made gingerbread into every imaginable shape from fat pigs to full omnibuses
as the door opened tessa saw what looked to her like a fairy feastall silver mugs and flowery plates and oranges and nuts and rosy wine in tall glass pitchers and smoking dishes that smelt so deliciously she could not restrain a little sniff of satisfaction
bless us
alice get your play hood this handkerchief is all wet and maud bring the old chinchilla tippet
she tied a bright scarlet handkerchief over the old hood and the brilliant color set off her brown cheeks and bright eyes as well as the pretty black braids of her hair
little tessa sat alone by the fire waiting for her father to come home from work
as soon as her father was gone tessa flew about and put everything in nice order telling the children she was going out for the day and they were to mind tommos mother who would see about the fire and the dinner for the good woman loved tessa and entered into her little plans with all her heart
at dusk they went home tessa so hoarse she could hardly speak and so tired she fell asleep over her supper
i have no way to say thank you but ranza shall be for you a heavenly angel and i will sing my heart out for your tree cried tessa folding the mittens as if she would say a prayer of thankfulness if she knew how
are you hungry asked the boy in a grand tone
dear me
i say mamma she wants something to eat
they like my music and often give me sips of hot coffee which i like much
can i give her an orange called the boy prancing away into the splendid room quite like a fairy prince tessa thought
the children laughed and clapped their hands and cried more more
sit down and warm yourself and tell me about ranza said the kind elder sister who liked the confiding little girl in spite of her shabby clothes
the other days were very much like this sometimes they made more sometimes less but tommo always went halves and tessa kept on in spite of cold and weariness for her plans grew as her earnings increased and now she hoped to get useful things instead of candy and toys alone
at the fourth some people let them sing all their songs and gave nothing
ill do it if father will let me she said to herself smiling and nodding at the fire
if i could have a tree for the children id never want anything again but i cant so ill fill the socks all full and be happy said tessa as she looked wistfully into the gay stores and saw the heavy baskets go by
when she had told her plan peter benari shook his head and thought it would never do but tessa begged so hard he consented at last that she should try it for one week and sent her to bed the happiest little girl in new york
she sewed up the holes in her shoes as well as she could for she had much of that sort of cobbling to do she mended her only gown and laid ready the old hood and shawl which had been her mothers
up the wide stone steps went the street musicians and the whole flock came running down to give a handful of silver and ask all sorts of questions
she thanked tommo and ran away to get ready for she felt sure her father would not refuse her anything
give these to your brothers said the fairy prince stuffing nuts and oranges into tessas hands
the little mother kept nothing for herself but the pleasure of giving everything away yet i think she was both richer and happier than if she had kept them all
sing another little girl
it was rather a dirty hand but so kind that tessa clung to it and kept looking up at the friendly brown face for encouragement
tommos mother lent her a pair of boots so big that they turned up at the toes but there were no holes in them and tessa felt quite elegant in whole boots
you have a charming voice child
the lady understood her and stroked her cheek softly saying to her elder daughter we must take care of this good little creature
how gay the streets were that day how brisk every one was and how bright the faces looked as people trotted about with big baskets holly wreaths and young evergreens going to blossom into splendid christmas trees
she is dead now but i do not forget answered tessa in her pretty broken english
mamma and miss rose drilled them all and when the folding doors flew open one rapturous oh arose from the crowd of children gathered to the festival
she got up early to see if the socks were all right and there she found the most astonishing sight
so full of her plan was tessa that she ran upstairs at once and asked tommo if he would take her with him on the morrow
next morning the sun shone but the cold wind blew and the snow lay thick in the streets
but what can i do so small and stupid and shy as i am
yes sir meekly answered tessa
all the afternoon the two friends wandered about singing and playing and gathering up their small harvest
tessas father was an italian plaster worker very poor but kind and honest
o rose let us see the little girl and if she will do let us have her and tessa can learn our song and it will be splendid cried the biggest boy who sat astride of a chair and stared at the harp with round eyes
yes i will try and then if i do well the little ones shall have a merry christmas
the next three houses were empty and the last of all showed not a single face as they looked up anxiously
i do not mind cold and wet and cross people if i can get the pennies answered tessa feeling very brave with such a friend to help her
the day is very long people are cross and at night one is ready to die with weariness
ill ask mamma said rose and away she went into the dining room close by
i wish she could sing at our tree since bella is ill cried one of the children peeping through the banisters
oh so much exclaimed tessa adding eagerly my sister ranza is small and pretty as a baby angel
no she had a fine plan in her good little head and was trying to discover how she could carry it out
i know many songs and may get money if i am not frightened for people throw pennies to other little girls who only play the tambourine
tessa felt so grateful that without waiting for tommo she sang her sweetest little song all alone
you see christmas was coming in a week and she had set her heart on putting something in the childrens stockings as the mother used to do for while she lived things were comfortable
will you come too and bring your harp
at the first house a cross old gentleman flapped his newspaper at them at the second a young gentleman and lady were so busy talking that they never turned their heads and at the third a servant came out and told them to go away because some one was sick
one fat old frenchman nodded to her and it seemed to help her very much for she began to sing before she thought and that was the hardest part of it
she longed to make the beds and dress the children over night she was in such a hurry to have all in order but as that could not be she sat down again and tried over all the songs she knew
little ranza was accepted with delight by the kind lady and her children and tessa learned the song quite easily
tessa walked more quietly and rubbed her cold hands feeling that the world was a very big place and wondering how the children got on at home without the little mother
how tessa did tune up at that

the mortgager and mortgagee differ the one from the other not more in length of purse than the jester and jestee do in that of memory
interest however still runs on in both casesthe periodical or accidental payments of it just serving to keep the memory of the affair alive till at length in some evil hour pop comes the creditor upon each and by demanding principal upon the spot together with full interest to the very day makes them both feel the full extent of their obligations

the faces of those who were not conferring together were pale and perturbed
meanwhile an agitated consultation was being carried on in whispers among his generals and marshals at the rear of his suite
the position was the more awkward because the emperor meditating upon his magnanimous plans was pacing patiently up and down before the outspread map occasionally glancing along the road to moscow from under his lifted hand with a bright and proud smile
yet here she is lying at my feet with her golden domes and crosses scintillating and twinkling in the sunshine
he was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended to adopt toward moscow
but my clemency is always ready to descend upon the vanquished
but no it cant be true that i am in moscow he suddenly thought
on the ancient monuments of barbarism and despotism i will inscribe great words of justice and mercy
some said that a deputation of some sort must be scraped together others disputed that opinion and maintained that the emperor should first be carefully and skillfully prepared and then told the truth

of course in those days no one ever thought of smoking a pipe in the presence of ladies

the growth of cigar smoking was rapid
this must have been before eighteen forty one when sir astley died
the period covered by this chapter included both the crimean war and the indian mutiny and every one knows how the soldiers in the crimea and in india alike craved for tobacco as for one of the greatest of luxuries and how even an occasional smoke cheered and encouraged and sustained suffering humanity
in more fashionable circles the mere possession of a pipe might be looked at askance
the vulgar thing falls upon the floor and tom is ashamed to claim his property and so acknowledge his ownership of a pipe

university men used to be rather particular about the pipes they smoked
the dukes prejudices were stronger than his facts
kingsleys devotion to smoke seems to have surprised tennyson who was no light smoker himself
consequently men had either to indulge in the practice out of doors or else as you say sneak away to the kitchen when the servants had gone to bed and puff up the chimney
