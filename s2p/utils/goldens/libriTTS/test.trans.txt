'Come hither, come hither, my handsome son, and let me comb your hair for you.'
So Cinderlad told him whence he came, and that he was brother to the two who had watched the seven foals for the King, and then he inquired if he might be allowed to try to watch them on the following day.
So when he had walked the whole day, he too came to the King's palace as darkness began to fall.
It was all but dark when they got back to the King at nightfall, and he himself was standing in the courtyard waiting for them.
'Yes, that is where we are to go in,' said the Foal.
So they journeyed onwards a good bit farther.
When he had run thus for a long time, he too came to the cleft in the rock.
'Hast thou watched well and faithfully the whole day?' said the King to Cinderlad.
'Dost thou see anything?'
They only just managed to live from hand to mouth, and had great difficulty in doing even so much as that, but they had three sons, and the youngest of them was called Cinderlad, for he did nothing else but lie and poke about among the ashes.
When the Foals got into the churchyard they turned into men and looked like the sons of a king, and their clothes were so magnificent that they shone with splendour, and they went into the church and received bread and wine from the priest, who was standing before the altar, and Cinderlad went in too.
'Dost thou see anything now?'
'I am walking about in search of a place,' said Cinderlad.
'No,' said Cinderlad.
Then the King knew how his watching had been done, and fell into such a rage that he ordered his people to chase the youth back to his own home at once; but first they were to cut three red stripes in his back, and rub salt into them.
'Yes, that I have!' said the youth.
He had a fancy to try to watch the seven foals himself, he said.
There the old hag was once more sitting spinning from her distaff, and she cried to Cinderlad;
One day the eldest lad said that he would go out to earn his living; he soon got leave to do that, and set out on his way into the world.
When the youth reached home again, anyone can imagine what a state of mind he was in.
'That is a river,' said the Foal, 'and we have to cross it.'
'Oh, no,' said the lad.
Cinderlad promised to do this, and then they went on farther.
So they travelled onwards again, for many and many a mile, over hill and dale.
THE SEVEN FOALS
There stood the King outside on the steps, and he asked whither he was bound.
In the grey light of dawn the Master of the Horse let out the seven foals, and off they went again over hill and dale, and off went the lad after them.
He walked on and on for the whole day, and when night was beginning to fall he came to a royal palace.
'Now, then,' said the Foal, 'dost thou not see anything now?'
'Yes, diligently and faithfully hast thou watched,' said the King, 'and thou shalt have the Princess and half the kingdom.'
'Canst thou wield that sword?' asked the Foal.
The two brothers laughed at him, and his father and mother begged him not to go, but all to no purpose, and Cinderlad set out on his way.
When they had travelled a long, long way, the Foal said:
'Here you see their meat, and here you see their drink.'
'I have done my best,' replied Cinderlad.
When he had run after the foals for a long, long time and was hot and tired, he passed by a cleft in the rock where an old woman was sitting spinning with a distaff, and she called to him:
'No,' said Cinderlad.
On the third day Cinderlad wanted to set out.
'Alas! no,' said Cinderlad.
Cinderlad tried, but could not do it; so he had to take a draught from the pitcher, and then one more, and after that still another, and then he was able to wield the sword with perfect ease.
So they went on a great distance farther.
The two others laughed at him, and mocked him.
And thus they journeyed onwards a long, long way.
So all was made ready for the wedding, and the King said that it was to be so stately and magnificent that everyone should hear of it, and everyone inquire about it.
'Yes, I will go too,' said Cinderlad, 'for I have taken it into my head.'
But all went with him as it had gone with his brother.
As soon as she caught sight of the youth, who was running after the foals till the perspiration streamed down his face, she cried:
When evening was drawing near, the youth wanted to go.
'And now?' inquired the Foal, 'seest thou nothing now?'
Then he threw a lock of wool into the river, and when it floated down against the sword it was cut into two pieces.
But Sigurd waited till half of him had crawled over the pit, and then he thrust the sword Gram right into his very heart.
But a day or two later his tutor said to Sigurd, 'There is a great treasure of gold hidden not far from here, and it would become you to win it.'
Sigurd tried this blade on the lump of iron, and it did not break, but split the iron in two.
Then Sigurd went down into that deep place, and dug many pits in it, and in one of the pits he lay hidden with his sword drawn.
And he hammered and wrought them into a new sword, so sharp that fire seemed to burn along its edges.
But it brought good luck to nobody.
So Gunnar and Brynhild were married, though it was not Gunnar but Sigurd in Gunnar's shape, that had ridden the fire.
'High over Hindfell Red fire is flaming, There doth the maiden dwell She that should love thee well, Meet for thy taming.
Because it is so old and so beautiful the story is told here again, but it has a sad ending-indeed it is all sad, and all about fighting and killing, as might be expected from the Danes.)
Then Gunnar tried Sigurd's horse Grani, but he would not move with Gunnar on his back.
Then Brynhild saw the ring which Sigard had given to Gudrun, and she knew it and knew all, and she turned as pale as a dead woman, and went home.
But he said 'No,' his luck was gone, his sword was broken, and he must die.
Then Gudrun wakened and saw him dead, and she moaned aloud, and Brynhild heard her and laughed; but the kind horse Grani lay down and died of very grief.
ONCE upon a time there was a King in the North who had won many wars, but now he was old.
Then he took the helmet off the head of the sleeper, and behold, she was a most beautiful lady.
Another sword he made, and Sigurd broke that too.
Sigurd chose him: his name was Grani, and he came of Sleipnir's breed, and was the best horse in the world.
Then immediately he understood the language of birds, and he heard the Woodpeckers say:
Sigurd said:
But in the night, when the battle was over, his young wife came out and searched for him among the slain, and at last she found him, and asked whether he might be healed.
So he treated her royally, and as time went on she had a son called Sigurd, a beautiful boy and very strong.
So this was done, and they hid in a wood, but there some strangers met them and carried them off in a ship to Denmark.
Then Sigurd was so grieved and his heart so swelled in his breast that it burst the steel rings of his shirt of mail.
For her husband, she said, had ridden through the flame when no other man dared face it.
Then the person who had killed Otter went down and caught the Dwarf who owned all the treasure and took it from him.
When Sigurd heard the story he said to Regin:
But it chanced that he touched it with his finger, and it burned him.
And his wife called her maid to her and said, 'Let us change clothes, and you shall be called by my name, and I by yours, lest the enemy finds us.'
This curse came upon her when the thorn of the tree of sleep ran into her hand long ago as a punishment because she had displeased Odin the God.
Long ago, too, she had vowed never to marry a man who knew fear, and dared not ride through the fence of flaming fire.
Then the old man said, 'Drive all the horses into the river, and choose the one that swims across.'
And then Brynhild fell a weeping till her heart broke.
Now there was at that time a dwarf called Andvari, who lived in a pool beneath a waterfall, and there he had hidden a great hoard of gold.
The fourth bird said:
And she said:
They have carved on the rocks pictures of some of the things that happen in the tale, and those carvings may still be seen.
'Make me a good sword that I may kill this Dragon.'
Then the otter skin was filled with gold and covered with gold, all but one hair, and that was covered with the poor Dwarf's last ring.
'It is too late.'
And when they were brought before the King, he thought the maid looked like a Queen, and the Queen like a maid.
So Sigurd said that sword would do.
The old King went out and fought bravely, but at last his sword broke, and he was wounded and his men fled.
'There lies Regin, ready to betray Sigurd, who trusts him.'
And when the wedding was over and all the feast, then the magic of the witch's wine went out of Sigurd's brain, and he remembered all.
Then Sigurd rode away, and he came to the house of a King who had a fair daughter.
And the wind bore it blazing out to sea, flaming into the dark.
For Sleipnir was the horse of Odin, the God of the North, and was as swift as the wind.
THE STORY OF SIGURD
Then his tutor, whose name was Regin, told him that all this great hoard of red gold had once belonged to his own father.
But all men die, and no brave man lets death frighten him from his desire.
Thus died Sigurd, Fafnir's bane, whom no ten men could have slain in fair fight.
Sigurd went out and Brynhild determined to slay him.
Then he saw the track which the Dragon made when he went to a cliff to drink, and the track was as if a great river had rolled along and left a deep valley.
'I would touch none of it if by losing it I should never die.
When he had been at home a few days, he rode out with Regin one morning to the heath where the Dragon used to lie.
'Yet I thought,' she said, 'that no man could have done this deed but Sigurd, Fafnir's bane, who was my true love.
There he waited, and presently the earth began to shake with the weight of the Dragon as he crawled to the water.
So Sigurd went within the castle door, and there he saw someone sleeping, clad all in armour.
So Sigurd put the heart of Fafnir on a stake, and roasted it.
'A strange Queen to light the fires,' thought the King.
So he asked the Queen, 'How do you know in the dark of night whether the hours are wearing to the morning?'
Then the Dragon lashed with his tail till stones broke and trees crashed about him.
So Regin made a sword, and Sigurd tried it with a blow on a lump of iron, and the sword broke.
The next bird said:
So Sigurd drove them, and only one swam across.
Only one ring was left, which the Dwarf wore, and even that was taken from him.
All that evening she never spoke.
And she said he would never see her glad in his hall, never drinking wine, never playing chess, never embroidering with the golden thread, never speaking words of kindness.
Then he spoke, as he died, and said:
And Fafnir had lived in a cave with iron doors, a cave dug deep down in the earth, and full of gold bracelets, and crowns, and rings; and there, too, Sigurd found the Helm of Dread, a golden helmet, and whoever wears it is invisible.
And after that Sigurd was called Fafnir's Bane, and Dragonslayer.
All these he piled on the back of the good horse Grani, and then he rode south to Hindfell.
Then she rent all her needlework asunder and wept aloud, so that everyone in the house heard her.
Now Brynhild had no help but to promise she would be his wife, the wife of Gunnar as she supposed, for Sigurd wore Gunnar's shape, and she had sworn to wed whoever should ride the flames.
Then he died.
But he has forgotten me, and my promise I must keep.'
But now she and Sigurd loved each other, and promised to be true to each other, and he gave her a ring, and it was the last ring taken from the dwarf Andvari.
And one day Otter had been fishing there, and had killed a salmon and eaten it, and was sleeping, like an otter, on a stone.
'A rich house where the maids wore gold,' said the King. 'Truly you are no maid, but a King's daughter.'
Then Sigurd remembered how the story went that somewhere, far away, there was a beautiful lady enchanted.
'My father gave me a gold ring,' said she, 'and always, ere the dawning, it grows cold on my finger.'
The third bird said:
He had a tutor to be with him, and once the tutor bade him go to the King and ask for a horse.
But he was brave, and he spoke not a word of it to the others to make them unhappy.
First Fafnir, the Dragon, killed his own father, and then he went and wallowed on the gold, and would let his brother have none, and no man dared go near it.
That they may keep, it is necessary not to be sparing of sugar.
It is considered to be sufficiently boiled when some taken up in a spoon pours out like oil.
The use of the spaddle is to stir up and remove from the sides of the freezing pot the cream, which in the shaking may have washed against it, and by stirring it in with the rest, to prevent waste of it occurring.
Boil the solution again, throw in a little more cold water, remove the scum, and so on for three or four times successively; then strain it.
Ices are composed, it is scarcely necessary to say, of congealed cream or water, combined sometimes with liqueurs or other flavouring ingredients, or more generally with the juices of fruits.

The expense of preserving them with sugar is a serious objection; for, except the sugar is used in considerable quantities, the success is very uncertain. Sugar also overpowers and destroys the sub acid taste so desirable in many fruits: these which are preserved in this manner are chiefly intended for the dessert.
In this way it is, also, that orange and lemon chips are preserved.
Put more sugar on this, and then another layer of the slices, and so on till the jar is full.
fifteen o one.
The principal thing to be acquainted with is the fact, that, in proportion as the syrup is longer boiled, its water will become evaporated, and its consistency will be thicker.
A dessert would not now be considered complete without candied and preserved fruits and confections.
The principal utensils required for making ice creams are ice tubs, freezing pots, spaddles, and a cellaret.
Before sugar was in use, honey was employed to preserve many vegetable productions, though this substance has now given way to the juice of the sugar cane.
When the ice tub is prepared with fresh pounded ice and salt, the freezing pot is put into it up to its cover.
The thousand and one ornamental dishes that adorn the tables of the wealthy should be purchased from the confectioner: they cannot profitably be made at home.
The reason why the fruit is emptied out of the preserving pan into an earthen pan is, that the acid of the fruit acts upon the copper, of which the preserving pans are usually made.
The garnishing needs especial attention, as the contrast of the brilliant coloured fruits with nicely arranged foliage is very charming.
Let it boil up again; then take it off, and remove carefully the scum that has risen.

The patterns and colours are also subject to changes of fashion; some persons selecting china, chaste in pattern and colour; others, elegantly shaped glass dishes on stems, with gilt edges.
CHAPTER thirty.
Fruit gathered in wet or foggy weather will soon be mildewed, and be of no service for preserves.

DESSERT DISHES.
It has long been a desideratum to preserve fruits by some cheap method, yet by such as would keep them fit for the various culinary purposes, as making tarts and other similar dishes.
However, as late as the reigns of our two last Georges, fabulous sums were often expended upon fanciful desserts.
The syrup employed should sometimes be clarified, which is done in the following manner:--Dissolve two pounds. of loaf sugar in a pint of water; add to this solution the white of an egg, and beat it well.
Lastly, tie a wet bladder over the mouth of the jar, or cork and wax it.
Boil them up three days successively, skimming each time, and they will then be finished and in a state fit to be put into pots for use.
CONFECTIONARY.
Until fruit can be used, it should be placed in the dairy, an ice house, or a refrigerator.
But to distinguish these properly requires very great attention and considerable experience.
The spaddle is generally made of copper, kept bright and clean.
It is necessary, then, that this function should have scarcely commenced, or that it should be completely finished, before partaking of ices.
They are preserved abroad in most ornamental and elegant forms.
Great care must be taken in the management of the fire, that the syrup does not boil over, and that the boiling is not carried to such an extent as to burn the sugar.

The shape of the dishes varies at different periods, the prevailing fashion at present being oval and circular dishes on stems.

After each bailing, it is proper to examine into the state of the syrup when cold; if too thin, it will bear additional boiling; if too thick, it may be lowered with more syrup of the usual standard.

Any of the fruits that have been preserved in syrup may be converted into dry preserves, by first draining them from the syrup, and then drying them in a stove or very moderate oven, adding to them a quantity of powdered loaf sugar, which will gradually penetrate the fruit, while the fluid parts of the syrup gently evaporate.
If the pan is placed close on to the fire, the preserve is very liable to burn, and the colour and flavour be consequently spoiled.
Fruit pastes are a kind of marmalades, consisting of the pulp of fruits, first evaporated to a proper consistency, and afterwards boiled with sugar.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES, CONFECTIONARY, ICES, AND DESSERT DISHES.
They should be dried in the stove or oven on a sieve, and turned every six or eight hours, fresh powdered sugar being sifted over them every time they are turned.
At desserts, or at some evening parties, ices are scarcely to be dispensed with.
The aged, the delicate, and children should abstain from ices or iced beverages; even the strong and healthy should partake of them in moderation.
When they have cooled, take them out and drain them.
The method to be pursued in the freezing process must be attended to.
ICES.
But he was very wroth, and none can blame him for that; so he caused the brother to be thrown into a pit full of snakes.
When the King entered and saw it, he stood still as if he were in fetters, and could not stir from the spot, for the picture seemed to him so beautiful.
'Kiss me, girl!' said the head.
'What is my brother saying?' asked his sister again.
'She shall be the prettiest girl that ever was, and fair and bright as the day,' said the first head.
On the first Thursday night after this, a beautiful maiden came into the kitchen of the palace, and begged the kitchen maid, who slept there, to lend her a brush.
They were both good children, and loved each other with all their hearts.
She wept and she wailed, but as her brother had said that, she thought she must do it; so she leaped into the sea.
'What is my brother saying?' asked the man's daughter.
One day they sent her to the brook to fetch some water home, and an ugly and horrible head rose up out of the water, and said, 'Wash me, girl!'
They made her do all the hard work, and hard words fell to her lot early and late, but little enough food accompanied them.
The man's daughter wept, and was sorely troubled, for Little Snow was the dearest thing she had on earth, but at last she threw him overboard.
Then she was forced to depart, but as she went she said:
'He says that you are to throw your casket out into the sea,' answered the step mother.
'Open the door!' cried the King, but the youth did not hear.
The step mother fell into such a towering passion that she drove the man's daughter into the pig stye-she might stay there with her fine show of gold, the step mother said, but she should not be permitted to set foot in the house.
At last they came in sight of land.
'Brush me, girl!' said the head.
'As if I would kiss your ugly mouth!' said the girl.
'Well, if my brother says so, I must do it,' said the man's daughter, and she flung her casket into the sea.
Both her step mother and her step sister were always finding fault with her, whatsoever she did and whithersoever she went, and they scolded her and abused her so that she never had an hour's peace.
I shall come twice more, and then never again,' said she.
This time also, as before, she borrowed a brush and brushed her hair with it, and the gold dropped down as she did it; and again she sent the dog out three times, and when day dawned she departed, but as she was going she said as she had said before, 'I shall come once more, and then never again.'
'There is nowhere on earth so beautiful a woman as this!' said the King.
But though he rubbed his eyes and did everything he could to keep himself awake it was all in vain, for the Bushy Bride crooned and sang till his eyes were fast closed, and when the beautiful young maiden came he was sound asleep and snoring.
'Yes, I will kiss you,' said the man's daughter, and she did it, but she thought it was the worst bit of work that she had ever had to do in her life.
The third time it was just beginning to grow light, and then she said:
'Kiss me, girl!' said the head.
So they sailed onwards a long way farther.
'I can't get near, because of my nose,' said the daughter.
But his sister, who was still at home, fared worse and worse.
So the heads all began to talk to each other, and to ask what they should do for this girl who was so full of kindliness.
'Now he says that you are to make haste and throw yourself overboard,' answered the step mother.
After some time had gone by the man married again, and he chose a widow with one daughter who was ugly and wicked, and her mother was ugly and wicked too.
When the brother arrived at home to fetch his sister, her stepmother and step sister would go too.
'It is I! I want to come in.'
'Wash me, girl!' it said.
When she got there with her pails, the first head rose up out of the water close to the bank.
BUSHY BRIDE
'Wash yourself!' answered the woman's daughter.
Then the second head appeared.
These two things were all that she had inherited from her mother.
'Now I shall never come again,' she said, and then she turned to go.
At first the King would not believe this, but after a long, long time, they prevailed with him, and he crept on tip toe to the door, peeped through, and saw the youth on his knees, with his hands clasped together before a picture which was hanging on the wall.
Chris turned his back on Mike and started down the hill.
Gee!
"Yes," said Chris suddenly, "I'm coming.
"Are you coming?" Mike challenged, with a hint of derision.
"Well-" he admitted, "I did.
"o k," he said.
I'm going now."
"Everybody knows what's outside his window!" he burst out.
Wicker's such a queer old guy.
But a chore was a chore, and was never worth discussion.
"You said you were coming with me!"
He spoke cheerfully.
Whaddaya suppose?"
At the foot of the hill he reached the house.
Chris started off once more, passing the bleak little Victorian church perched on the hill above mr Wicker's house.
There were three things that always caught his eye, amid the litter of dusty pieces.
His gaze moved back to the house itself.
My mother told me to bring her some stuff from the Safeway.
"You bet he does!
His mother's sick," he repeated, "an' Jakey don' look so good himself."
After a step or two, not finding his friend beside him, he turned.
Mike stopped and looked at Chris with a comical expression.
Chris paused to look below him.
Even from where he stood, fifty feet above the house, the slope of the hill was sharp and the plan of the house below him could be plainly seen.
"Think he really needs it?" he pursued.
"Well, I was," Mike howled back, "but I just remembered.
All at once he wondered how his mother was, and everything in him pinched and tightened itself.
Houses and shops thinned suddenly on both sides of the street.
"So-" Mike swallowed.
"Only why didn't you ask him yourself?"
Mike was standing on the corner.
"o k
Let's see you."
"I'll go with ya!" Mike announced, as if that finished the argument; which, as a matter of fact, it did.
It was getting dark.
"Certainly my boy," boomed out the Captain, his blue eyes abruptly keen and penetrating.
Maybe whoever it was will give himself away somehow and give me a clue.
No doubt.
Next, Ned Cilley was relieved at the helm by Elbert Jones, who took over.
Ned went on down.
"mr Finney will be some time on deck.
Chris lost no time, as soon as he could do it without being noticed, in hurrying down to his cabin.
Racing to his cabin and back, even in those few seconds Chris could see a change in the sky.
"Oh sir!" he cried, "mr
I think I can do it safely, or I should not try, sir."
He then went on to describe what else was to follow-the covering of the ship with leaves to make it blend with its surroundings. Camouflage was not a word the Captain, or anyone else of his time, yet understood.
"Yes sir.
It looks to me as if it could have been one of several people, and I'll be switched if I know who.
We shall say no more, but I trust you understand the responsibility you have?
He joked with the cook at the galley door, and probably went on, for I didn't see him come by again.
What can be said during that time, sir?" Chris thought to ask.
They went down to their quarters first. They were really closest to the hatch.
Or did he?
I shall say that you are in my own cabin so that I can care for you.
He knew now that his absence, for as long as he had to be away, would be covered up and satisfactorily accounted for.
Guess mr Finney went to his quarters-I don't remember seeing him cross the deck or come over that way at all.
Chris wrinkled his brow with concentration.
They had the vigor of a man in the prime of life, and their presence in that puckered face of age which confronted Chris was horribly disconcerting.
The sharp black outline of mr Wicker impressed itself on his eyeballs, and in the room, now totally dark except for the light that streamed from the faraway open door, mr Wicker's body seemed to radiate a bright edge, like a carbon paper held up to the sun
"He's a schoolmate of mine.
"Yes sir," he said.
mr Wicker's eyes were not those of an old man at all.
The room seemed overly still.
Yes, they were still there.
He guessed there must be a lively fire in that room beyond.
The double fans of minute wrinkles breaking from eye corner to temple and joining with those over the cheekbones were drawn into the horizontal lines across the domed forehead.
The thin lips crackled the withered and multi wrinkled cheeks in the ghost of what had once been a smile.
Chris could catch the shine as lantern glow touched the silver buckles on their shoes.
What he saw was a fresh cheeked lad tall for thirteen, sturdy, with sincerity and good humor in his face, and something sensitive and appealing about his eyes.
Going as far as the wall to his left and leaning forward, Chris looked up toward M Street.
Would that interfere with Jakey's getting the job, sir?" Chris enquired.
The wide bow window was there before him, the three objects he liked best showing frosty in the moonlight that poured in from across the water.
"I-I just wondered if the place was still open."
Then, in that second, he turned and faced about.
He thought he detected a pleasant smell of herbs, like the potpourri his mother had in bowls in their house.
It wouldn't be fair for me to take it if Jakey has a chance."
You wanted something?"
William Wicker's face in itself was not forbidding.
Flabbergasted and breathless, Chris was unaware that he had moved closer to peer out the window in every direction.
And why had the sound of wheels, of gears and of horns, been so completely muffled out?
They moved into the inn; the coach rattled off to the stable.
You see, I don't really need it, and Jakey does.
Jakey will be cared for, never fear."
It was no longer there, nor were the high walls and smokestacks of factories to be seen.
Chris blinked and looked again.
No electric signs, no lamplit streets.
You don't say, on the sign, and Jakey isn't awfully well.
Where was the freeway?
mr Wicker was busy, and Becky Boozer had gone off to market accompanied by Ned Cilley.
mr Wicker waited patiently beside him for a few moments for Chris to get up his courage.
The more he thought of it, the more Chris knew it had to be attempted.
He squatted on his haunches, examining the carved wooden figure attentively, and felt convinced that, once alive, the boy would be an ideal and happy companion.
If you get stuck I can help you.
If he was to be a magician, could he make this boy come to life?
Grown people, however gay and kind, were never quite the same.
There were the words, and there the charm. Certain elements were to be mixed and poured at the proper time.
Dusk came two hours before its time; thunder snarled in the sky.
Remember Incantation Seventy three, Book One."
He hurried, memorizing as he closed the book, and hoisted it once more to its high shelf.
Well, what do you know?
From that time, Chris became increasingly proficient, and as his ability grew he began to find magic a wonderful game, which he and mr Wicker played together.
Seventy four, Book One: The Return."
His head swam and he felt faint and a little sick, but he persisted through the final words.
The afternoon, rainy before, increased in storm.
mr Wicker began moving about upstairs; the floorboards creaked, and still Chris could not leave until the potion fumed and glowed.
With difficulty, standing on tiptoe, Chris lifted it down, and placing it on the floor, turned over page after page.
"Better come back now.
What shall I do first?"
One day Chris wandered alone into the dusty shop.
"You will do famously, my boy.
"Suppose I change and can't change back?"
Chris got up and stole back to mr Wicker's door.
"Never fear, Christopher.
"How you have improved, my boy!" he exclaimed.
This union will fill with happiness the hearts of all toilers.
"At this moment we are not only trying to solve the Land question, but the question of Social Revolution-not only here in Russia, but all over the world.
Are you going to allow the ranks of the proletariat to be divided?
"Yes," they cried, "wait until the peasants speak.
That is what is happening at this moment.... Yesterday Kerensky; to day Lenin and Trotzky; another to morrow....
Long live the United Democracy!" the peasants poured out of the building.
He knew that an agreement with the Bolsheviki was being discussed, but he did not know that it had been concluded.
"You call yourselves the people of Russia.
"Who are you?
The old Executive Committee had withdrawn, and was holding a rump convention of its own in another room of the same building, made up of bolting delegates and representatives of the Army Committees.
From now on, in the Russian Republic, all the organisation and administration of the State, from top to bottom, must rest on that union.
Long live the Peasants!"
Lenin and Trotzky remained in the Government, and the Military Revolutionary Committee continued to function.
Who administers the confiscated land-the former proprietor, or the Land Committees?
What has been done with the agricultural machinery and with the farm animals?
Then Boris Reinstein, delegate of the American Socialist Labor Party: "The day of the union of the Congress of Peasants and the Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies is one of the great days of the Revolution.
How much and in what respect does the amount of land now under cultivation differ from the amount fixed by the Government as an average minimum?
I say, 'Count on that revolutionary determination, but don't forget your gun!'"
His first act was to bitterly rebuke the Executive Committee for leaving the Congress.
But will the Constituent Assembly desire to do the will of the Russian peasants?
By declaring the assembly "Extraordinary Conference," it had been planned to block the reelection of the Executive Committee.
The great hall was jammed with people and shaken with continual clamour; deep, stubborn bitterness divided the delegates into angry groups.
Even the sun came out, pale and watery, at noon.
The Dumas and Zemstvos were dropped.
Only two months before considered an extreme revolutionist, and very popular with the peasants, he was now called to check the dangerous drift of the Congress toward the Left.
The life of the city grew gay, and the very Revolution ran swifter....
Wait until the peasants-"
He spoke to the rump convention.
The peasants understood the exact meaning of the Revolution-they tried to turn words into action....
It is desirable that agricultural properties well appointed and well organised should be administered by Soviets composed of the regular employees of those properties, under the direction of competent agricultural scientists.
After a brief conversation I left-and that's all! Let any one present make such an accusation!"
Now people accuse Kerensky; they forget that he was raised to power, not only by the Soviets, but also by the popular masses....
He was interrupted by a great burst of laughter; and realising the situation, he left the platform and the room, taking his popularity with him....
If Compromise continues, the Revolution disappears.
Has the ground cultivated by the peasants been augmented?
"Shooting down your Russian brothers on the streets!"
While the peasants had been politically backward, still they had their own peculiar ideas, and they constituted more than eighty per cent of the people of Russia.
However, no harm has been done by that; for the Land Committees are paying no attention to the Soviet decrees, but are putting into operation their own practical decisions-decisions based on the will of the vast majority of the peasants....
The savages set up gods to which they pray, and which they punish if one of their prayers is not answered....
If we are broken, then it will be in defending our flag...."
Lenin's argument was simple.
The other old peasant spoke to his comrade, "I am not tired," he said.
Aren't they workingmen like ourselves?"
"We have proposed to both Kerensky and the Bolsheviki to retire from the power.
A German-"
The galleries were thronged with workers-who, in Russia, still remember their peasant origin....
Followed him Lenin, listened to now with absorbing intensity.
But this worked both ways; the Left Socialist Revolutionists decided that if the Congress had no power over the Executive Committee, then the Executive Committee had no power over the Congress.
You should remain neutral!
Meanwhile, the question of the status of the Executive Committee was agitating all minds.
There is no force in the world which can put out the fire of the Revolution!
"The recent events," said the orator, "do not indicate a simple riot, or a 'Bolshevik adventure,' but on the contrary, a real popular rising, which has been greeted with sympathy by the whole country....
"All right!" said he.
He must study the aspects of the agrarian problem in the province.
Finally, except for the right side of the hall, the demonstration wore itself out somewhat.
"If the Bolsheviki succeed, or if they fail, the fate of Russia will not be changed.
Of that we cannot be sure....
It seemed to me as if the Congress were hopelessly deadlocked.
And with the shout, "Long live the end of civil war!
"As far as the Constituent Assembly is concerned, it is true, as the preceding speaker has said, that the work of the Constituent will depend on the revolutionary determination of the masses.
Cries, "Down with the Bolsheviki!"
On the twenty seventh occurred the debate on the Land question, which revealed the differences between the agrarian programme of the Bolsheviki and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries.
In spite of Revolution, all Russia plunging dizzily into the unknown and terrible future, joy swept the city with the coming of the snow.
From the first days, the Bolsheviki declared that the peasants should take over the land 'by revolutionary mass action.' This is nothing but anarchy; the land can be taken over in an organised manner....
"Comrades!
Right away!"
The Socialist political party-this is the vanguard of the working class; it must not allow itself to be halted by the lack of education of the mass average, but it must lead the masses, using the Soviets as organs of revolutionary initiative....
"We Bolsheviki have not changed our Land programme; we have not given up the abolition of private property in the land, and we do not intend to do so.
"The Land decree of the Congress of Soviets is identical in its fundamentals with the decisions of the first Peasants' Congress.
Where does such an accusation come from?
Who are you to destroy the legal Government?
With biting sarcasm he went on to speak of the Allied diplomats, till then contemptuous of Russia's invitation to an armistice, which had been accepted by the Central Powers.
In the morning we woke to window ledges heaped white, and snowflakes falling so whirling thick that it was impossible to see ten feet ahead.
For these reasons the Peasants' Congress sustains entirely the Revolution of november seventh... as a social revolution, and expresses its unalterable will to put into operation, with whatever modifications are necessary, but without any hesitation, the social transformation of the Russian Republic.
He was invited to sit on the platform....
"You are no better than murderers!" he cried.
We don't recognise your Government!"
The Russian villages understand perfectly what they want, and they are now carrying out their own measures....
"Long live the Revolutionary Army!
The Constituent Assembly will not dare to break with the will of the people...."
The reactionaries of the Executive Committee no longer dared openly to appear.
Show me the source!"
"We invite the Left Socialist Revolutionaries to enter that coalition, insisting, however, that they cease looking backward, and that they break with the 'conciliators' of their party....
"However," he went on, in an unmoved voice, "nobody will deny that the present Government of Russia has been formed by the Bolshevik party-" he had to wait a moment, "so that for all purposes it is the same thing...." Here the right benches broke into deafening clamour, but the centre and left were curious, and compelled silence.
Whereupon the old Executive Committee left the hall....
The sound of it will ring with resounding echoes throughout the whole world-in Paris, in London, and across the ocean-in New York.
Anybody who attempts to destroy the Soviets is guilty of an anti democratic and counter revolutionary act.
The captain shouted at the top of his voice.
"I greet you with the christening of a new Russian life and freedom!"
"Moreover, I want to warn you now that the Bolsheviki will never accept your demands...."
At every mention of the word "union" there was ecstatic applause....
"Singa Phut," was the panting answer.
"You can't take it away," said Donovan.
In fact, I have a feeling that I'll land my fish.
For they recognized that the colonel would be against them and the prosecutor's detectives when it came to the trial of james Darcy.
Get ready, Shag!"
And can it be done?"
"Ha!" laughed Donovan shortly.
Now I know.
"Glad to know you, Colonel Ashley," said Donovan.
See you later!" and, making sure that his blackjack and revolver were in his pockets, Donovan hurried out, followed by the colonel, whose hand had loosely closed over the ticking watch which, unseen, went out with him.
It's just one of them coincidences like.
"Look here, Colonel! do you know anything about this?" and the detective's professional instincts got the upper hand of his friendliness.
Held so tight we could hardly get it out.
Just that.
"This is an old timer.
As you may have guessed, it's a divorce case I have just finished, and so quietly that it hasn't become public property yet.
And, Donovan, take a friend's advice and don't be too free with that watch."
"Hello," answered the sleuth.
Ever take it up?" and as the colonel questioned he was looking at the Indian timepiece under a magnifying glass he took from his pocket.
Now, I'm afraid I won't.
"Neighbors often heard 'em scrappin' a lot, and this afternoon they went at it again hot and heavy.
And the watch?
And there's no reason you shouldn't know.
"Are you going to work on that case, Colonel?"
"It isn't our case, so we don't know much about it."
Who has it?"
You do as I tell you.
If you'll excuse me I'll pretend I'm fishing, and I may catch something.
All we want to do-Pinkus and me-is to lay our hands on the Dago that done it and got away.
"Yes, that part's true enough, but that's all there is to it.
But how did it happen?"
"Of course-as is usual in a divorce case.
"Then you think he did it?"
"Not the least in the world-not as much as you do," was the cool answer.
I shouldn't be surprised but what it dated back to the time of Queen Elizabeth, though it has been repaired and remodeled since then to make it more up to date.
"Yes," went on the colonel musingly.
"I may need it as evidence when we get mr Phut, or whatever the Dago's name is."
"Pinkus and Donovan; haven't they, Carroll?"
The old adage of two heads, you know-"
"Yes.
"But, all joking aside, this is quite a wonderful piece of work.
"Oh, no, I wouldn't think of taking it away.
"Gad!" exclaimed the colonel.
Singa Phut got back his watch after the prosecutor decided he didn't need it for evidence.
The two men had seen each other before, but had not spoken.
Busted his head in with a heavy candlestick-one of a pair.
I suppose the lady-there is a lady in it, of course?" questioned the colonel.
"Yes.
"Too free with it?" asked the surprised detective.
"Go as far as you like, Colonel," returned Thong, needlessly generous. "We've got our man, and that's all we want.
Then things quieted down, and nobody heard anything more.
"That's right," agreed the colonel, as he continued to move his magnifying glass over the surface of the still ticking watch.
In fact it was so tight that he's cut his palm grabbin' hold of it.
"Yes, it's here.
Maybe the fight was about who owned the watch, for the Dagos talked in their foreign lingo and none of the neighbors could tell what they were sayin'."
But we'll get him!"
"How did it happen?
"Yes, but it's so plain there's no interest in it for you.
"Rather a hypothetical question, Colonel, but I should say it might be a fifty fifty proposition.
That was away back in the fifteenth century."
"Exactly.
"If they're here, yes."
"I see.
And I've read enough about germs to know the danger.
"And the watch was in Ali's hand?"
"Simply because this watch-"
"I should worry about that!
Don't scratch yourself on it, whatever you do."
"In a way, yes.
"Surest thing you know.
"What's up?" asked Carroll.
"He raised the howl right off, and Pinkus and I got there as soon as we could.
"Perhaps not," admitted Colonel Ashley.
It's mrs Larch, wife of Langford Larch, the wealthy hotel owner.
"Sure he did!
I'd advise you to be careful!"
And a close observer might have observed that he did not touch his bare fingers to the timepiece, but poked it about, and touched it here and there, with the end of a leadpencil.
Me study watches?
"Oh, no I was just interested, as Singa Phut was one concerned in mrs Darcy's murder."
And you are right.
No one knows much about Ali, for he came here just recently.
"Thanks!" laughed Kenneth.
"That's all right, Shag.
"Be back in a minute."
There wasn't nothing that Singa had to do with the Darcy case anyhow, and he seemed awful anxious to get back that watch.
"Why not?
I'm working in the interests of the young man.
"But did he really kill his partner?"
And is there any truth in the newspaper story about the same watch that was found in mrs Darcy's hand being found in the hand of the dead man?"
"Very interesting.
Quite an interesting study-watches-Donovan.
But for a quiet place to think, give me a fishing excursion every time!
"'No alimony'?" repeated the colonel, puzzled.
"All right-be there in a second.
Perhaps I can help you.
"Who?
"Donovan!"
We'll get him, too, before many days.
You're on the Darcy case, they tell me."
But I need to do a little more smoking out first.
"Some one out here to see you."
"Sure!
"I want to talk over Darcy's case with you," the colonel had said.
Have you it?"
"But, as a matter of fact these East Indians are often carriers of bubonic plague, you know, and it's very contagious.
"I've read a lot about you.
"I don't want it, either.
Probably new works put in.
"Very interesting," observed the colonel, as he passed the watch back to Donovan, still using only the flat, open palm of his hand on which to rest it.
Carroll and Thong were there, and if they did not exactly welcome the colonel as a kindred spirit they at least accorded him the respect due a fellow craftsman in the peculiar line where talent may be found most unexpectedly.
Now I want to think.
"Yep." Carroll was too much engaged in watching the blue smoke curl lazily upward from his cigar just then to say more.
He found the place without a light in it, stumbled over something on the floor, and there was Ali's body, with the head busted in and this heavy candlestick near it.
"Yes.
I'd recommend him to you instead of Blackstone."
Well, the question I am trying to solve is why did she say: 'No alimony!'"
And I've got to do some tall thinking now.
"Some Dago had his head busted in," remarked Thong.
"You're not as squeamish as all that, are you?
"What!
But I want to know just where we stand.
You buy?" cried Donovan.
Hear it tick?" and Donovan held open the door of his closet.
Queen Elizabeth was very fond of watches and clocks, and her friends, knowing that, used to present her with beautiful specimens. Some of the watches of her day were made in the form of crosses, purses, little books, and even skulls."
Ah, there's nothing like the philosophy of my friend Izaak Walton.
And the two had talked, had thought, had talked again, and now were silent for a time.
I should say not!
We've got to prove james Darcy innocent by establishing the fact that some one else killed his cousin."
Somewhat to the surprise of Donovan the military detective accepted the timepiece on his open palm, and so gingerly that it caused Donovan to remark:
But I hear you have another murder."
It still holds good.
"That's the watch," announced the headquarters detective, reaching in for it.
"Oh, well, there isn't much of a story to it," and Donovan's voice showed his disappointment.
Who else?"
"But there are some peculiar coincidences and, if you don't mind, I'd like to see what I can find out about them."
I have a little problem on my hands."
When it does it will create a sensation."
"If you don't mind, I should like to examine this a bit."
"Yes.
"What is it?
"The very pair I was going to buy!"
She has just been granted, on my application before the vice chancellor, a separation from her husband, but she refused to accept alimony, and for the life of me, with all Larch's wealth, I can't see why.
"Friend of mine just tipped me off where I can get him!
"Quite a curiosity," said the colonel at length.
Colonel Ashley said nothing.
"It can, and I'm going to do it.
"Oh, not at all," was the quick answer.
"What are the chances of getting him off legally if we go at it from a negative standpoint?" asked the colonel.
"Here's some one to see you," and the presentation was quickly and informally made.
King regarded his questioner gravely, as though deeply pondering over the matter.
But it will take time."
A number of "men about town," as they liked to be called, were in, and Colonel Ashley was sipping his julep when there entered mr Kettridge, the relative of mrs Darcy, whose jewelry shop he was managing pending a settlement of her estate.
"Then for the love of-"
"What?" called Kenneth.
And that behind the laughter in her eyes was the shadow of a skeleton at the feast.
"But Amy-and the disgrace?"
"I have been spending a week end in the country," King remarked, with biting sarcasm.
But I don't suppose more than two or three know that."
"And it takes all sorts of persons to make it up.
He saw Darcy frequently at the jail, and to that young man's pleadings that something be done, always returned the answer:
"Hello, Harry!
"Go on."
"So I understand.
You aren't the only suspect, though.
"Why not?"
There was a laugh at this, for scarcely one in the gilded grill but knew where King had been, and whither he was going.
They took Harry away a while ago.
Langford Larch could not himself be called a drinking man. Occasionally, as almost perforce he had to, he drank a little wine. But he was never noticeably drunk.
To this was the answer-whispered:
"My idea, exactly," returned the colonel.
Quite a racing man he is, a gentleman and a fine judge not only of whisky, which is good in its place, but of horses and men, too.
He seems to have been decent for a while after their marriage-which marriage was a mistake from the first-I can see that now.
"Why Polonius?" some one asked.
"Don't worry!
"Isn't it?" agreed the colonel.
"Only that I-" Darcy hesitated and grew red.
"Larch!"
I wasn't thinking of that.
Now cheer up!
"She doesn't consider herself disgraced, and you shouldn't.
Besides, anything I could say now wouldn't set you free.
The rumors floated about a bit, seemed to sink, and then started off at full steam just before the news of the separation became public.
Going a little higher up the scale in population he might have been designated as a hotel proprietor.
"Well, when Cynthia came to me, in my capacity as lawyer as well as old friend, I could hardly believe what she told me about her husband," went on Kenneth.
"I didn't.
She was really forced into this marriage which, to say the least, must have been distasteful to her.
Have you any theory-"
THE ODD COIN
"Will you join me in a Welsh rabbit?"
"Larch is lushing!"
For I really think he loved Cynthia once.
They talked of much, including the murder, and the colonel was more than pleased to find that the jeweler had no very strong suspicion against young Darcy.
"Why did she take him?"
Larch himself was a peculiar character.
And her father, too-he's with you from the drop of the flag, he told me.
"No!
The evening passed pleasantly for them.
Colonel Ashley fished for a time in silence, broken only by the gentle snores of Shag, farther back in the field, and by the murmur of the water.
He remembered that Cynthia and Grafton had once been in love with each other.
"I think I see it now."
"Well, I don't know that you can.
Nor was that side of his business ever accentuated.
"Because Larch made no defense.
It was often characteristic of him that, though he became very much intoxicated, yet, at times, under such conditions, Harry King's language approached the cultured, rather than degenerated into the common talk of the ordinary drunk.
The stopped clocks, for instance.
I don't imagine, for a moment, that fool King had a hand in this affair.
But I have been gathering up some loose ends, and I think I know where to tie them together.
Grave, and even reverend, conventions assembled in its ballroom, and politicians of the upper, if not better, class were frequently seen in its dining room or cafe.
"I said, where have you been?" remarked the other.
It was all due to a misunderstanding, he said.
It happened to be so now.
"You've got a friend in her of whom you may be proud.
"It isn't generally known," went on the lawyer, "that the hotel keeper's wife has left him.
"Not a great deal.
"no
It had a double reputation, so to speak.
Larch, by refusing to appear, practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation.
"Thanks.
So King got bail!
You can't get out before a trial or before I can produce some one on whom I can actually fasten the murder.
The colonel did not disclose the fact that it was no news to him. Aaron Grafton's statement was being unexpectedly confirmed.
"I think I do."
Incidentally the vice chancelor was furious when it became known that the documents had been inspected by a reporter, but then it was too late.
She also saw an opportunity of paying old debts and reaping some revenges.
He was bailed out to day.
On those grounds I went before the vice chancellor, prepared to prove my case by competent witnesses.
"Good evening, Colonel," he called genially.
Well, it's a queer world anyhow!"
"Because, dear friend," replied King softly, "he somewhat resembles a certain person here, who talks too much, but who is not so wise as he thinks.
There's Harry King, still locked up-"
But, for a time, the entertainments were kept up, and Cynthia, lovelier than ever, presided at her husband's table, graced it with her presence, and laughed and smiled at the men and women who came to partake of their lavish hospitality.
"Now as to certain matters in the store on the morning of the murder.
Who put it up?
"The hotel keeper?"
I used to know Cynthia when she was a girl-she was the daughter of Lodan Ratchford, and her mother had peculiar and, to my mind, wrong ideas of social position and money.
But in Colchester, which was rather unique among cities, he was looked up to as one of the substantial citizens of the place, for he owned the Homestead, where Washington, when it was a wayside inn, had stopped one night-at least such was the rumor-and families socially prominent, some of whose members had very strong views on prohibition, did not hesitate to attend balls given at the hotel.
So cheer up, and I'll do the best I can for you.
And when the fish was landed, panting on the grass, and Shag had been roused from his slumber to slip the now limp fish into the creel, Colonel Ashley gave a sigh of relief and remarked:
However, don't think I'm not interested in your case.
She had some means of her own, she declared, and would work rather than accept a cent from him.
"Money!"
He let the case go by default, for which I was glad, as it saved Cynthia from telling her story in open court.
I'm going to rectify them.
In a smaller place he would have been called a saloon keeper.
"The reason she asked no alimony?" inquired Kenneth.
My fish!" chuckled the colonel, as he skilfully played the luckless trout, now struggling to get loose from the hook.
"I can't tell you yet, Darcy.
I wish I had been in his shoes."
"That's what he did.
And it was whispered about:
There was little that was tangible-mere gossip-a hint that she would have been happier with some one else, though he had not so much money as had Larch.
"The solution to my problem?"
"no
"I'm glad you're not.
"No; but he will, or I'll sue him and get judgment.
I've fished enough for to day.
The finely appointed hotel kept by Larch, called the "Homestead," from the name of an old inn of Colonial days which it replaced, was known for miles around.
Gradually there had come about little whispers that Cynthia Larch had made a mistake in her marriage.
They had become friends since the colonel's first visit to the store, and the friendship had grown as they found they had congenial tastes.
But his are pretty uncertain shoes to be in just the same.
Came, at that instant, fairly bursting into the quiet grill room, some "jolly good fellows," to take them at their own valuation.
I'm working several ends, and they all must be fitted together, like the old jigsaw puzzle, before I can act.
"He isn't?" cried the old detective, and there was surprise in his voice.
But the separation of mr and mrs Larch was different.
There were three of them, the center figure being that of Harry King, and he was very much intoxicated.
mrs Larch, resuming, her maiden name, it was announced, had gone to a quiet place to rest.
I am, as Shag calls it, 'detectin',' and I just came out here to clarify my thoughts.
It's a plain and sordid story enough, with the exception of her refusal of alimony, and that I can't understand.
Well, poor Cynthia is paying the penalty now.
"She said he had struck her more than once, and she could stand it no longer.
Oh, he'll pay all right.
Still I would like to know.
After the marriage, which was a brilliant and gay one, if not happy, the Larch hotel-it could hardly be called a home-became the scene of many festive occasions.
All in good time.
"I'll tell her!"
"Do you know who killed my cousin?"
It will come out all right!"
"It has no connection with the Darcy murder, and so I didn't mention it to you before."
Meanwhile Colonel Ashley was a very busy man, and to no one did he tell very much about his activities.
But they were not needed."
He'll be so tickled to get out of paying his wife a monthly sum that he'll settle with me.
"I've known him from a boy," said mr Kettridge, "and, though he has his faults, a crime such as this would be almost impossible to him, no matter what motive, such as the dispute over money or his sweetheart. He may be guilty, but I doubt it."
And, in a way, it was true.
All in good time.
"Did he pay it?"
I'm glad you told me, though.
There will be a sensation when this comes out."
The best of police headquarters or prosecutor's detectives make mistakes.
Not that, ordinarily, I'm satisfied with one, but I'm not working the rod now.
And I can't do that yet.
"I guess I understand," said the colonel with a laugh.
The old colored man, wrapped in a warm coat, for it was not summer yet, seemed to be enjoying his siesta when, with a suddenness that was startling in that solitude, the military detective uttered a cry of:
The murder of mrs Darcy had, some time ago, been shifted off the front page, though it would get back there when the young jeweler was tried. As for the killing of Shere Ali, that occasioned only passing interest, the murdered man not being well known.
"I beg your pardon?" he said, in the cultured tones he knew so well how to use, yet of which he made so little use of late.
I thought you knew it."
For the papers of her testimony had been sealed, and it was only by a sharp trick on the part of Daley that he got access to them.
"Certainly, my dear Kenneth."
Darcy, you've got good friends!"
Having done that, I'm at your service, if I can help."
"I've got it!"
"We've missed you."
"Thank you, no I'm afraid my digestion isn't quite up to that, as I've had to cut out my fishing of late.
Being convenient to the courthouse, nearly all the judges and lawyers took lunch there.
As I said, the facts of the separation of the Larchs will soon be heralded all over the city, for the final papers were filed to day, and the reporters will be sure to see them.
That is not always, but sometimes.
But that's not the point.... Votes, please!
"That is a matter for each man's own decision," he said severely.
Levin went nearer.
And the marshal disappeared through a side door.
No checking the accounts of the marshal; he's not a cashier....
They expressed the most implacable hatred.
"I'm worn out, I'm old.
In the doorway the marshal of the province jostled against Levin.
Several times he repeated the words: "I have served to the best of my powers with truth and good faith, I value your goodness and thank you," and suddenly he stopped short from the tears that choked him, and went out of the room.
Put it to the vote!
Two noble gentlemen, who had a weakness for strong drink, had been made drunk by the partisans of Snetkov, and a third had been robbed of his uniform.
Then several voices began to talk all at once, and the tall nobleman with the ring, getting more and more exasperated, shouted more and more loudly.
"Beg pardon, excuse me, please," he said as to a stranger, but recognizing Levin, he smiled timidly.
The confidence of the monarch....
The leaders of both parties were reckoning white and black on their fingers.
His face and his whole figure in his uniform with the crosses, and white trousers striped with braid, as he moved hurriedly along, reminded Levin of some hunted beast who sees that he is in evil case.
In reply Snetkov spoke of the trust the noblemen of the province had placed in him, the affection they had shown him, which he did not deserve, as his only merit had been his attachment to the nobility, to whom he had devoted twelve years of service.
They are voting on the legal point."
"And one vote may decide the whole question, and one must be serious and consecutive, if one wants to be of use in public life," concluded Sergey Ivanovitch.
It seemed to Levin that he would have liked to say something, but could not speak for emotion.
But the old party did not consider themselves conquered.
Sergey Ivanovitch put his hand into the box, put the ball somewhere, and making room for Levin, stopped.
Levin was standing rather far off.
The discussion upon Flerov had given the new party not only Flerov's vote, but had also gained time for them, so that they could send to fetch three noblemen who had been rendered unable to take part in the elections by the wiles of the other party.
The crowd parted to make way for Sergey Ivanovitch approaching the table.
Sergey Ivanovitch read the act and began to explain its meaning, but at that point a tall, stout, round shouldered landowner, with dyed whiskers, in a tight uniform that cut the back of his neck, interrupted him.
No need for more talking!"
"A hundred and twenty six for admission!
"Please come, Konstantin d mitrievitch," he said, "your brother's looking for you.
Sergey Ivanovitch frowned.
"It's not likely," said the marshal, looking round with a scared expression.
But Levin forgot all that, and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons, for whom he had a respect, in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement.
They were disputing, as far as he could make out, as to the interpretation to be put on the act and the exact meaning of the words: "liable to be called up for trial."
To escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the refreshment bar.
This old man was a touching and pathetic figure to Levin now, and he longed to say something pleasant to him.
Sergey Ivanovitch, waiting till the malignant gentleman had finished speaking, said that he thought the best solution would be to refer to the act itself, and asked the secretary to find the act.
"So you're sure to be our marshal again," he said.
But the persons speaking paused, and his improper question was overheard.
Looks and faces were even more violent and furious than their words.
A ballot!
They were to proceed immediately to the election.
Every nobleman sees it!
"A ballot!
The most solemn moment was at hand.
We shed our blood for our country!...
On learning this, the new party had made haste, during the dispute about Flerov, to send some of their men in a sledge to clothe the stripped gentleman, and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting.
"He's all right?
Beastly!..." shouted furious and violent voices on all sides.
"There are some among us, too, like our friend Nikolay Ivanovitch, or Count Vronsky, that's settled here lately, who try to carry on their husbandry as though it were a factory; but so far it leads to nothing but making away with capital on it."
I have told him so, but it makes no difference. Only think of it!
Last year at our district marshal, Nikolay Ivanovitch's."
They're proprietors of a sort, but we're the landowners.
But one's work is thrown in for nothing."
Above suspicion."
"Yes," Levin answered, with proud satisfaction.
Without a return too.
"Yes, yes," said Levin, "that's perfectly true.
"Why, as you said, to keep the fire in.
I speak from my heart.
The excitement grew more intense, and every face betrayed some uneasiness.
"Well, and how is your land doing?"
"But I tell you what," the landowner pursued; "a neighbor of mine, a merchant, was at my place.
The landowner chuckled under his white mustaches.
Next, a whole crowd of country gentlemen, surrounding a stout general, hurriedly came near Levin.
We're all gentlemen, aren't we?
"Yes, it's rather strange," he went on.
"Well, and how is your land doing?" asked Levin.
"Then why do you come?" asked Levin.
So there'll be no one to keep it up.
He knew him at once.
It's a decaying institution that goes on running only by the force of inertia.
And nowadays that bark's worth something.
These gentlemen, now, what do they come for?" he said, pointing to the malignant gentleman, who was talking at the high table.
As noblemen, they're cutting their own throats."
"Very, very glad to have met you," he added, seeing Sviazhsky approaching him.
What would you have?
"He's such a blackguard!
"Oh, well, one does it!
There's no meaning in it at all.
"And with what he made he'd increase his stock, or buy some land for a trifle, and let it out in lots to the peasants," Levin added, smiling. He had evidently more than once come across those commercial calculations.
"And he'd make his fortune.
He went to the window and sat down, scanning the groups, and listening to what was being said around him.
"Why, what is there to understand?
"From habit, nothing else.
And yet one does it.
At a simple loss."
He couldn't collect it in three years!" he heard vigorously uttered by a round shouldered, short, country gentleman, who had pomaded hair hanging on his embroidered collar, and new boots obviously put on for the occasion, with heels that tapped energetically as he spoke.
"Oh, damn your acts!
"That it may be, but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully.
"Yes, but you don't reckon your own work.
"Oh, not very well.
My son in law wants to stand as a permanent member; they're not rich people, and he must be brought forward.
It's a moral obligation of a sort.
They were the generals organizing the approaching battle.
Snetkov, now....
"Then why do you do it, if it's a clear loss?"
I'll tell you my own case.
We may be of use, or we may not, but we're the growth of a thousand years.
The rest, like the rank and file before an engagement, though they were getting ready for the fight, sought for other distractions in the interval.
I make five per cent."
"Very glad to see you!
"I ought to own that I don't very well understand the drift of the provincial elections," said Levin.
"That's the new generation of nobility."
You won't grow him again in a year," he said cautiously, and he immediately changed the conversation.
There's no doubt he'll be a scientific man.
And then, to tell the truth, there's one's own interests.
I remember you very well.
These persons were unmistakably seeking a place where they could talk without being overheard.
To be sure!
The speaker was a country gentleman with gray whiskers, wearing the regimental uniform of an old general staff officer.
"Just as we do," said Levin.
Besides that's not work for a nobleman.
"But you say it's an institution that's served its time."
Levin had seen him already at the meeting on the previous day, and he had studiously avoided him, not caring to greet him.
The landowner looked at him.
But Nicholas was not at home when they entered.
'Very good.
Improvident and self indulgent were his words.'
Visiting register offices, seeing all manner of unlikely people, and very few in the least likely, absorbed Margaret's time and thoughts for several days.
It's simple, and not far to fetch, nor hard to work.'
'And I do!' said her father laughing.
But good night, child.
But though she received caresses and fond words back again, in such profusion as would have gladdened her formerly, yet she felt that there was a secret withheld from her, and she believed it bore serious reference to her mother's health.
His father "dying in miserable circumstances." Why it might have been in the workhouse.'
How would you set about it?'
At Helstone unpunctuality at meal times was a great fault in her mother's eyes; but now this, as well as many other little irregularities, seemed to have lost their power of irritation, and Margaret almost longed for the old complainings.
'The mother of whom he spoke to us?' said Margaret.
'Oh, papa, by that testing everything by the standard of wealth.
No one came forwards to help the mother and this boy.
'I believe what I see, and no more.
'Not exactly,' replied Margaret, smiling.
'You have caught her.
'I am surprised at you, Margaret,' said her mother.
One afternoon she met Bessy Higgins in the street, and stopped to speak to her.
Thornton!' exclaimed mrs Hale.
She lay awake very long this night, planning how to lessen the evil influence of their Milton life on her mother.
But we must first catch our house mother.'
Now let me try.
I may be the Cinderella to put on the slipper after all.'
Bessy was silent in her turn for a minute or two.
Margaret bent over and said, 'Bessy, don't be impatient with your life, whatever it is-or may have been.
'Now, I'll not have my wench preached to.
'Don't think hardly on him-he's a good man, he is.
'No, mamma; that Anne Buckley would never have done.'
That's my creed.
I don't set him up for a hero, or anything of that kind.
I really was very much afraid of showing him how much shocked I was at some parts of what he said.
'But surely,' said Margaret, facing round, 'you believe in what I said, that God gave her life, and ordered what kind of life it was to be?'
'Everybody else has had their turn at this great difficulty.
'How tainted?' asked her father.
I really liked that account of himself better than anything else he said.
Bell says), taking in mr Thornton as a kind of partner.'
I knew it all along from mr Bell; so I was aware of what was coming; but I half expected to see you get up and leave the room.'
I don't think, mr Hale, you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been.
There were several other signs of something wrong about mrs Hale.
When he spoke of the mechanical powers, he evidently looked upon them only as new ways of extending trade and making money.
Margaret went away very sad and thoughtful.
She was late for tea at home.
'Margaret!' said mr Hale, as he returned from showing his guest downstairs; 'I could not help watching your face with some anxiety, when mr Thornton made his confession of having been a shop boy.
'Not vicious; he never said that.
mr Bell said they absolutely lived upon water porridge for years-how, he did not know; but long after the creditors had given up hope of any payment of old mr Thornton's debts (if, indeed, they ever had hoped at all about it, after his suicide,) this young man returned to Milton, and went quietly round to each creditor, paying him the first instalment of the money owing to him.
Margaret was collecting her mother's working materials, and preparing to go to bed.
'Personally, as you call it, and all.
At last she said in a low voice,
'Have you met with a servant, dear?'
'I shall like to see her.
There was another child, I believe, a girl; too young to earn money, but of course she had to be kept.
At least, no friend came forwards immediately, and mrs Thornton is not one, I fancy, to wait till tardy kindness comes to find her out.
His father speculated wildly, failed, and then killed himself, because he could not bear the disgrace.
Your mother looks sadly tired to night, Margaret.'
'But what was it?
Margaret held her in her arms, and put the weary head to rest upon her bosom.
And the poor men around him-they were poor because they were vicious-out of the pale of his sympathies because they had not his iron nature, and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich.'
'Perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us, and be glad of our place.
Margaret did not speak, but held the water to her lips.
'I had forgotten what I said for the time,' continued Margaret quietly. 'I should have thought of it again when I was less busy.
She must be an uncommon person,' her mother added.
Margaret had noticed her mother's jaded appearance with anxiety for some time past, and this remark of her father's sent her up to bed with a dim fear lying like a weight on her heart.
They have said that he is even a little imbecile, that he does not remember himself of the most common events of his life.
She hurried to him immediately, and led him off to look at the picture.
I had thought all this, Philip; night after night I had dreamt the same dream,--the bright happy dream in which my father came home to me, the fond foolish dream in which I felt his strong arms folded round me, and his true heart beating against my own.
And Laura had her own pet plans.
Philip Jocelyn was examining some pictures on the other side of the room when his wife made this discovery.
The artist took out one of his own cards, and wrote the required address in pencil.
I want to see what he was when he was bright and young before the world had hardened him.
"He calls himself Kerstall-Frederick Kerstall; he is the son of an old monsieur, who calls himself also Kerstall, and who had much of celebrity in England it is many years."
"What is it you want me to do, my darling?"
We'll go to mr Kerstall immediately, if you like.
"When did I ever say no to anything you asked me, Laura?
But it was not the less the most charming city in the universe; and Philip Jocelyn and his wife were as happy as two children in this paradise of brick and mortar.
Laura thanked the French artist and then took her husband's arm and walked away with him.
Laura said all this in a very low voice as she walked with her husband through the garden of the Luxembourg.
The painter shrugged up his shoulders, and pursed up his mouth, thoughtfully.
Sir Philip never refused his wife anything; so he said, yes: and Laura ran away to her dressing room like a school girl who has been pleading for a holiday and has won her cause.
Sir Philip may have been a little too much devoted to horses and dogs, and Laura may have been a shade too enthusiastic upon the subject of new bonnets, and the jewellery in the Rue de la Paix.
"But, madame," he said, "this Monsieur Kerstall's father is very old, and he has ceased to paint it is a long time.
I remember all the Rubenses at the Louvre, for I saw them three years ago, when I was staying in Paris with grandpapa.
But there are some others who say that his memory has not altogether failed, and that he is still enough harshly critical towards the works of others."
"Kerstall!" exclaimed Laura, suddenly; "mr
But before that time I was very unhappy about my father.
I wonder who painted that lovely face?"
I like the modern pictures best, Philip: and I want you to tell me all about the artists, and what I ought to admire, and all that sort of thing."
You will be doing me such a favour, Philip, if you'll say yes."
"I want you to give me a long day in the Luxembourg.
"And his name, monsieur?"
But why are you so anxious to see this old portrait of your father, my dear?"
She returned in a little more than ten minutes, in the freshest toilette, all pale shimmering blue, like the spring sky, with pearl grey gloves and boots and parasol, and a bonnet that seemed made of azure butterflies.
They suited each other so well; they were never tired of each other's society, or at a stand still for want of something to say to each other. They were rather frivolous, perhaps; but a little frivolity may be pardoned in two people who were so very young and so entirely happy.
I want to see all the pictures-the modern pictures especially.
A DISCOVERY AT THE LUXEMBOURG.
The Frenchman might have run on much longer upon this subject, but Laura was too impatient to be polite.
It was a peasant girl's head, very exquisitely painted by a modern artist, and the baronet approved his wife's taste.
Ah, Philip, since we have known and loved each other, it seems to me as if I had no thought or care for any one in all this wide world except yourself.
"I should so like one to hang in my morning room at Jocelyn's Rock.
"How I wish you could get me a copy of that picture, Philip," Laura said, entreatingly.
She turned to the French artist presently, and asked him where the elder mr Kerstall lived, and if there was any possibility of seeing him.
One morning Laura told her husband, with a gay laugh, that she was going to victimize him; but he was to promise to be patient and bear with her for once in a way.
I had expected that he would be so fond of me.
"I don't think you will have any difficulty in finding the house."
"Because I want to see what he was before he went to India.
"Go, leave me, fiend!" replied the wounded Norman.
And so for some time the fight went on; many combatants falling on either side.
"Yet first let me say," said De Bracy, "what it imports thee to know.
"Wilfred of Ivanhoe!" exclaimed the Black Knight-"prisoner, and perish!
Markest thou the smouldering and suffocating vapour which already eddies in sable folds through the chamber? Rememberest thou the magazine of fuel that is stored beneath these apartments?"
And with this epistle the unhappy old man set out to procure his daughter's liberation.
He denounced Rebecca as a witch, by whose enchantment Bois Guilbert had been led to offend against the rules of the Holy Order, and in tones of passion and scorn he refused to listen to Isaac's protestations of her innocence.
"Call on them again, valiant baron," said the hag, with a smile of grisly mockery; "but know, mighty chief, thou shalt have neither answer nor aid.
"De Bracy," said the knight, "thou art free; depart.
During the confusion which reigned amongst the followers of Front de Boeuf when the attack had commenced, Rebecca had been allowed to take the place of the old crone, Ulrica, who was in close attendance on the wounded man who had been brought into the castle in company with Isaac of York and the other captives.
Before long the towering flames had surmounted every obstruction, and rose to the evening skies one huge and burning beacon, seen far and wide through the adjacent country; tower after tower crashed down, with blazing roof and rafter.
He had hitherto feared for his daughter's honour; he was now to tremble for her life.
Her long dishevelled gray hair flew back from her uncovered head, while the delight of gratified vengeance contended in her eyes with the fire of insanity.
"Yield thee, rescue or no rescue, or thou art but a dead man."
"I yield me to be true prisoner, rescue or no rescue," then answered De Bracy, in a tone of sullen submission.
Prince john turned pale, tottered, and caught at the back of an oaken bench to support himself.
But to return to the assault.
When the ponderous castle bell had tolled the point of noon, the Jewess was led from her secluded chamber into the great hall in which the Grand Master had for the time established his court of justice.
Beaumanoir tore open the seal and perused the letter in haste, with an expression of surprise and horror.
"Yield thee, De Bracy," said the Black Champion, stooping over him, and holding against the bars of his helmet the fatal poniard with which the knights despatched their enemies.
So saying, he mounted his strong war horse, and rode off through the forest.
He appealed to De Bracy to assist him in this project, and became at once deeply suspicious of the knight's loyalty towards him when he declined to lift hand against the man who had spared his own life.
One turret was now in bright flames, which flashed out furiously from window and shot hole.
At length De Bracy fell.
An interval of quiet now succeeded, the besiegers remaining in possession of the outer defences of the castle, and the besieged retiring for the time within the walls of the fortress.
"Detestable fury!" exclaimed the Norman.
Maurice de Bracy, I say, BEWARE!" De Bracy bowed low and in silence, threw himself upon a horse, and galloped off through the wood.
"I will not yield," replied the Norman faintly, "to an unknown conqueror.
The gallant young warrior, who, as he fell fainting to the ground, seemed to be abandoned by all the world, had been transported from the lists at the entreaty of Rebecca, to the house at Ashby then occupied by Isaac of York, where his wounds were dressed and tended by the Jewish maiden herself.
"Spurn this Jew from the gate," he said to one of his attendants, "and shoot him dead if he oppose or turn again.
It was on their journey to that town that they were overtaken on the road by Cedric and his party, in whose company they were afterwards carried captive to the Castle of Torquilstone.
But soon the conflict became even more desperate when the Black Knight, at the head of a body of his followers, led an attack upon the outer barrier of the barbican.
The maniac figure of Ulrica was for a long time visible on the lofty stand she had chosen, tossing her arms abroad with wild exultation.
Wilfred of Ivanhoe is wounded and a prisoner, and will perish in the burning castle without present help."
"Depart, and haunt my couch no more; let me die in peace."
Show me his chamber!"
The vanquished, of whom very few remained, scattered and escaped into the neighbouring wood.
He had come, the Jew was informed, for the purpose of correcting and punishing many of the members of the body whose conduct had of late been open to severe censure; and he was recognised, besides, as the most tyrannical oppressor of the Jewish people.
"Go to the barbican," said the victor in a tone of authority, "and wait there my further orders."
When the Black Knight reached the room, Ivanhoe was alone. Rebecca, who had remained with him until a few moments before, had just been carried off forcibly by Bois Guilbert.
"In peace thou shalt NOT die," repeated the voice; "even in death shalt thou think on the groans which this castle has echoed, on the blood that is engrained in its floors."
As the fire commenced to spread rapidly through all parts of the castle, Ulrica appeared on one of the turrets.
"Who is there?
And know, too, even now, the doom which all thy power and strength is unable to avoid, though it is prepared for thee by this feeble hand.
"They are fast rising, at least," said Ulrica; "and a signal shall soon wave to warn the besiegers to press hard upon those who would extinguish them.
Tell me thy name, or work thy pleasure on me."
When at length the attack upon the castle was commenced all was at once bustle and clamour within its gloomy walls.
The sufferer was Ivanhoe himself, who had so mysteriously disappeared on the conclusion of the tournament, when his father, Cedric, had sent his servants to attend him to a place of safety.
With his daughter we will deal as the Christian law and our own high office warrant."
Meanwhile, the Black Knight had led his forces again to the attack; and so vigorous was their assault, that before long the gate of the castle alone separated them from those within.
Here is a bugle, which an English yeoman has once worn; I pray you to keep it as a memorial of your gallant bearing.
"He is already thine," said Locksley, "and well for him!"
What art thou?" he exclaimed in terror.
"Gramercy for the gift, bold yeoman," said the knight; "and better help than thine and thy rangers would I never seek, were it at my utmost need."
"Leave me and seek the Saxon witch, Ulrica, who was my temptress; let her, as well as I, taste the tortures which anticipate hell."
The whole assembly wore an aspect of the most profound gravity- the reflection, as it were, of the sombre countenance of the austere and relentless Grand Master.
The life of every man in the castle shall answer it if a hair of his head be singed.
Showers of well directed arrows came pouring against each embrasure and opening in the parapets, as well as every window where a defender might be suspected to be stationed; and these were answered by a furious discharge of whizzing shafts and missiles from the walls.
Then the tiring women displayed Zaynab before Ali in the dress of the Jew's daughter, and he went in unto her and found her a pearl unthridden and a filly by all save himself unridden.
Eat of it and make the like of it." So he ate and fell down senseless, for the sweetmeats were drugged with Bhang, whereupon the Kazi bundled him into the sack and made off with him, charger and chest and all, to the barrack of the Forty.
Moreover, he took with him of his Mamelukes and negro slaves and cattle all that he needed for the road and clad himself and the Wazir and their company in traders' gear.
Then he went in unto the three other maidens and found them accomplished in beauty and loveliness.
When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighteenth Night,
Presently, the Prince again became impatient of the length of the way and bethought him of his beloved and recited these couplets,
The knocker replied, "Kamar, daughter of Azariah the Jew; say me, is Ali of Cairo with you?" Replied the broker's daughter, "O thou daughter of a dog!
When it was the Seven Hundred and Nineteenth Night,
Then said the Minister to the Prince, "Rejoice, O King's son, in all good; for see, yonder is the White City, that which thou seekest." Whereat the Prince rejoiced with exceeding joy and recited these couplets,
Now the cause of her slaying her sire was as follows.
On his way he met a sweetmeat seller, who was beating hand upon hand and saying, "There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!
On the night of his turning Ali into a dog, she saw, in a dream, a speaker who said to her, "Become a Moslemah." She did so; and as soon as she awoke next morning she expounded Al Islam to her father who refused to embrace the Faith; so she drugged him with Bhang and killed him.
Then Ali rose; and, casting the Jew's head down before him, said, "May thine every enemy be like this one, O Prince of True Believers!" Quoth Al Rashid, "Whose head is this?"; and quoth Ali, "'tis the head of Azariah the Jew." "Who slew him?" asked the Caliph.
Knowest thou whither he went?" Answered Hasan, "I know where he is," and opening the door of the closet, showed him the sweetmeat seller within, drugged and senseless.
When it was the Seven Hundred and Twentieth Night,
He destined me for literature.
This hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross, like a huge corpse with drooping arms.
He muttered:
Dampness was invading it, the flowers were deserting it.
The grave digger walked on in front of him.
A sort of letter box was constructed in the porter's window. The grave digger dropped his card into this box, the porter heard it fall, pulled the rope, and the small door opened.
He was a sort of laboring man, who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a mattock under his arm.
He had hardly the strength to stammer:--
Father Mestienne died."
The sun had not yet set when the hearse with the white pall and the black cross entered the avenue of the Vaugirard cemetery.
"It is made.
He approached the grave digger.
The Vaugirard cemetery formed an exception among the cemeteries of Paris.
"The man replied:--
The Vaugirard cemetery was what may be called a faded cemetery.
They were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small alley leading to the nuns' corner.
All at once the hearse halted; it had reached the gate.
But he had reverses.
"I have been a student.
"I am the convent grave digger."
He who empties his glass empties his heart.
The undertaker's man addressed himself to the porter of the cemetery.
It was Father Mestienne's turn.
In the first place, the rule; as for the code, we shall see.
I was obliged to renounce the profession of author.
The handle of a hammer, the blade of a cold chisel, and the antennae of a pair of pincers were visible, protruding from the man's pocket.
"Business first."
"Here's a fine farce!"
The gates of the Paris cemeteries closed, at that epoch, at sundown, and this being a municipal regulation, the Vaugirard cemetery was bound by it like the rest.
He played with Father Mestienne.
The hearse had set out again, and was rolling up the grand alley of the cemetery.
Make as many laws as you please, men; but keep them for yourselves. The tribute to Caesar is never anything but the remnants of the tribute to God.
"He was."
Fauchelevent burst out laughing.
The permission for interment must be exhibited.
This cemetery, with its peculiarities outside the regulations, embarrassed the symmetry of the administration.
If the man had not his card, he mentioned his name, the porter, who was sometimes in bed and asleep, rose, came out and identified the man, and opened the gate with his key; the grave digger stepped out, but had to pay a fine of fifteen francs.
The Vaugirard cemetery was a venerable enclosure, planted like an old-fashioned French garden.
This indicated the immediate proximity of the place of sepulture.
The good God consulted his note book which shows when the time is up.
Ah!
"After Napoleon, Louis the eighteenth.
By dint of excavating graves for other people, one hollows out one's own.
Fortunately, the soil, which was light and wet with the winter rains, clogged the wheels and retarded its speed.
A mourning coach, in which could be seen a priest in his surplice, and a choir boy in his red cap, followed.
"Father Mestienne is the grave digger."
"Comrade!" cried Fauchelevent.
I passed my fourth examination.
But you are a jolly fellow, too.
Let us remark in passing, that the burial of Mother Crucifixion under the altar of the convent is a perfectly venial offence in our sight.
In the cloister, what is called the "government" is only an intermeddling with authority, an interference which is always questionable.
As they must eat, I cannot drink."
Mestienne's head adjusted itself to the cap of Fauchelevent's will.
"According to the philosophers, the Eternal Father; according to the Jacobins, the Supreme Being."
The man replied:--
At the moment when the convoy entered the avenue leading to the cemetery, Fauchelevent glanced cheerfully at the hearse, and said half aloud, as he rubbed his big hands:--
Fauchelevent's confidence was perfect.
Behind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer, who limped along.
Do you know who little Father Lenoir is?
The grave diggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at night in winter, in this cemetery, they were subjected to a special discipline.
CHAPTER five-IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO BE DRUNK IN ORDER TO BE IMMORTAL
He had losses on 'change.
The bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the Vaugirard; it hinted at poverty.
What remained to be done was a mere nothing.
"You?"
The procession was going in the direction of the Vaugirard cemetery.
"He is dead."
The lame man who followed it was no other than Fauchelevent.
If a man could survive the blow of a cannon ball full in the breast, he would make the same face that Fauchelevent made.
"Villager," retorted the man, "I ought not be a grave digger.
He was one of those men who, though very young, have the air of age, and who, though slender, are extremely strong.
"I."
"It is so."
The grave digger resumed:--
He limped more out of anxiety than from infirmity.
It is one of the faults which resemble a duty.
Straight alleys, box, thuya trees, holly, ancient tombs beneath aged cypress trees, and very tall grass.
He was a tall, thin, livid, utterly funereal man.
"Their hunger is the enemy of my thirst."
In the evening it was tragic there.
It was suppressed a little later than eighteen thirty.
Father Mestienne is dead, but long live little Father Lenoir!
Such a thing cannot be refused."
Peasant, my name is Gribier."
I am sorry for it; he was a jolly fellow.
"The grave digger."
If any grave digger were delayed after that moment in the cemetery, there was but one way for him to get out-his grave digger's card furnished by the department of public funerals.
"What!
He had the air of an unsuccessful doctor who had turned grave digger.
During this colloquy, which always is productive of a delay of from one to two minutes, some one, a stranger, came and placed himself behind the hearse, beside Fauchelevent.
The hearse skirted a clump of cypress trees, quitted the grand alley, turned into a narrow one, entered the waste land, and plunged into a thicket.
I never drink."
The man replied:--
After Mestienne, Gribier.
"But," he persisted feebly, "Father Mestienne is the grave digger."
He was?"
"Ah!" said he, "what queer things do happen!
The nuns had committed it, not only without difficulty, but even with the applause of their own consciences.
Within the last two years, he had made good Father Mestienne, a chubby cheeked person, drunk at least ten times.
Fauchelevent had slackened his pace.
The man turned round.
"Shall we not make each other's acquaintance?" stammered Fauchelevent.
"Completely.
And he added, with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well:--
He made him dance according to his whim.
He is a jug of red wine.
"Yes."
"The grave digger?"
He did what he liked with him.
"The good God," said the man authoritatively.
It is true, nevertheless, that grave diggers do die themselves.
"Peasant, I have seven small children who must be fed.
And then, that there was another: the empty coffin.
"In that box!
The prioress expects you."
"I do."
The mere thought of it suffocates me."
But Jean Valjean's coolness prevailed over him in spite of himself.
And Jean Valjean added:--
That the prioress had told him to bring his brother on the following evening, after the counterfeit interment in the cemetery.
"No; I have the key to the door which communicates with the convent; the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church."
The hearse will drive directly up to the grave.
"What then?"
An old fellow of the old school.
"The coffin of the administration."
"Six feet."
The men will bear it.
I will tell you what will take place.
Jean Valjean, as in the first instance, contented himself with saying, "Impossible."
Fauchelevent grumbled, more to himself than to Jean Valjean:--
When I come to think it over, the earth instead of the corpse will not seem like the real thing, it won't do, it will get displaced, it will move about.
He grumbled:--
"About three o'clock in the afternoon.
The grave digger is a drunkard, and a friend of mine.
The hearse halts, the undertaker's men knot a rope around your coffin and lower you down.
Impossible to take a hammer and drive some nails in a plank?"
It stands on two trestles, under the pall."
I am left alone with Father Mestienne. He is my friend, I tell you.
Then he explained to Jean Valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he, Fauchelevent, was to render to the community.
It is not very near."
"A living person."
I shall have a hammer, a chisel, and some pincers in my pocket.
"The problem is to get out of here without being seen.
"no
"Let it be a white cloth, then."
I shall be hungry."
"How long is the coffin?"
"Could you hide me in that room to night when every one is asleep?"
That the nun who had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed, and interred in the vault under the altar of the chapel.
How is it managed?
That the prioress and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased.
"Are you alone?"
I have none."
The municipal doctor comes and says, 'A nun has died.' The government sends a coffin.
He is Father Mestienne.
That he, Fauchelevent, was to nail up the coffin in the cell, raise the stone in the chapel, and lower the corpse into the vault.
"Why not?"
"Good!
They will arrive a little before dusk, three quarters of an hour before the gates of the cemetery are closed.
"Me!" said Jean Valjean.
Fauchelevent, who was seated, sprang up as though a bomb had burst under his chair.
"I will breathe."
"What coffin?
The prisoner is subject to flight as the sick man is subject to a crisis which saves or kills him. An escape is a cure.
What administration?"
"Why, get out as you came in!"
"Who nails up the coffin?"
One of two things will happen, he will either be sober, or he will not be sober.
The priest says the prayers, makes the sign of the cross, sprinkles the holy water, and takes his departure.
"You are not like other men, Father Madeleine."
"The basket will be of pine, and the cover a black cloth."
The grave digger puts the corpses in the grave, and I put the grave digger in my pocket.
Any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape.
Every one has noticed the taste which cats have for pausing and lounging between the two leaves of a half shut door.
I have said that I would put earth in it.
"Who spreads the pall over it?"
"What is this dead room?"
What does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure?
Moreover, a coffin containing a living being,--that convict's expedient,--is also an imperial expedient.
"A man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze."
"And she will hold her tongue?"
This offers the means.
"When does the porter open that door?"
"Ah! good, you can laugh, you are not speaking seriously."
"But that is impossible!"
"I do."
"Very seriously, I must get out of this place."
"Father Fauchelevent, we must come to a decision: I must either be caught here, or accept this escape through the hearse."
"Well?"
"You!"
"no"
"There is another thing which bothers me.
Then you have no longer any one but me to deal with.
"Well, since there is no other means."
Nuns are buried in white."
"But you, Father Madeleine?"
Where is this coffin?"
I shall follow; that is my business.
Fauchelevent was of this hesitating nature.
Jean Valjean resumed:--
"Not another man, except the police doctor, can enter the dead room. That is even written on the wall."
Who is there who has not said to a cat, "Do come in!" There are men who, when an incident stands half open before them, have the same tendency to halt in indecision between two resolutions, at the risk of getting crushed through the abrupt closing of the adventure by fate.
"The only thing which troubles me is what will take place at the cemetery."
And, after a silence, fraught with anxiety, Fauchelevent exclaimed:--
Fauchelevent went on:--
"What church?"
"Put something in it."
"It is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening on the garden, which is closed on the outside by a shutter, and two doors; one leads into the convent, the other into the church."
What seemed unprecedented to Fauchelevent was, we repeat, a simple matter to Jean Valjean.
"Only to allow the undertaker's men to enter, when they come to get the coffin.
If we are to credit the monk Austin Castillejo, this was the means employed by Charles the Fifth, desirous of seeing the Plombes for the last time after his abdication.
The burial will take place at the Vaugirard cemetery a little before nightfall.
"I answer for that."
"You can come and nail me up in the coffin at two o'clock."
"What person?"
"Yes."
The over prudent, cats as they are, and because they are cats, sometimes incur more danger than the audacious.
To have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bale of goods, to live for a long time in a box, to find air where there is none, to economize his breath for hours, to know how to stifle without dying-this was one of Jean Valjean's gloomy talents.
"The empty one?"
"You surely must have a gimlet, you will make a few holes here and there, around my mouth, and you will nail the top plank on loosely."
When the coffin has been taken out, the door is closed again."
You understand, Father Madeleine, the government will notice it."
And how about food?
"The church in the street, the church which any one can enter."
"Have you the keys to those two doors?"
"In the first place, it will be a white cloth.
The next day it sends a hearse and undertaker's men to get the coffin and carry it to the cemetery.
Jean Valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was raving.
"But how will you manage to breathe?"
"A nun dies.
"What is that empty coffin?" asked Jean Valjean.
"If you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right, I am sure of getting you out of the grave.
That it was so much the worse for the government.
When a great personage, a marshal of France, a prince, a duke, and a peer, traversed a town in Burgundy or Champagne, the city fathers came out to harangue him and presented him with four silver gondolas into which they had poured four different sorts of wine.
On another occasion, the centenarian was telling stories.
It was a century which spoke through her, but it was the eighteenth century.
The rule of Fontevrault did not forbid this. She would not show this object to anyone.
Some unique chaplet?
On the first goblet this inscription could be read, monkey wine; on the second, lion wine; on the third, sheep wine; on the fourth, hog wine.
She said that in her youth the Bernardine monks were every whit as good as the mousquetaires.
Moral: Love conquered by the colic.
The most curious were baffled by her silence and the most tenacious by her obstinacy.
In a cupboard, under lock and key, she kept a mysterious object of which she thought a great deal.
One of the charming little Loves is already fairly spitted.
She told wonders of the Abbey of Fontevrault,--that it was like a city, and that there were streets in the monastery.
If she heard a footstep in the corridor, she closed the cupboard again as hastily as it was possible with her aged hands.
Thus it furnished a subject of comment for all those who were unoccupied or bored in the convent.
Some authentic relic? They lost themselves in conjectures.
He is resisting, fluttering his tiny wings, and still making an effort to fly, but the dancer is laughing with a satanical air.
She had even been in society before the Revolution.
It was a Faenza platter representing little Loves flitting away pursued by apothecary lads armed with enormous syringes. The chase abounds in grimaces and in comical postures.
She shut herself up, which her rule allowed her to do, and hid herself, every time that she desired to contemplate it.
She talked with a Picard accent which amused the pupils.
In the Little Convent there was a centenarian who came from the Abbey of Fontevrault.
She told about the custom of the four wines, which existed before the Revolution in Champagne and Bourgogne.
They found the object beneath a triple linen cloth, like some consecrated paten.
"Saint Terentius, Bishop of Port, where the mouth of the Tiber empties into the sea, requested that on his tomb might be engraved the sign which was placed on the graves of parricides, in the hope that passers by would spit on his tomb.
"Give me your orders, very reverend Mother."
"no"
They shut their eyes to the truth.
Fauchelevent held his peace.
"If you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort, my brother is the strong man for you.
A blessed woman."
His father was named Tecelin, and his mother Alethe.
"Did you not hear the bell?"
"Oh!
"There is a ring in the stone."
The prioress indulged in another little inward murmur, probably sacred, then raised her voice:--
In former times we had voices in the chapter, even on matters of the day.
I shall have my lever.
They persecute the saints.
A pause ensued.
"When the vault is open-"
In lowering the coffin."
What a glory of God for the community!
Fontaines in Burgundy is a country that is blest because it gave him birth.
"Yes."
There was something of paradise in that death."
"I don't understand you.
The prioress resumed:--
The prioress went on:--
"But she will hear."
All this is incontestable.
"Under the altar."
The office begins at midnight.
"I say more often."
"That is just."
"And the sister at the post?"
"But the commissary of police-"
And miracles issue from tombs."
"I am here to do anything you wish."
Fauchelevent mopped his forehead.
"Really?"
"The vault under the altar?"
These are my orders.
"You will do it as speedily as possible."
Besides, what the cloister knows the world learns not."
"That is true."
The clock struck opportunely.
The prioress, who was usually subjected to the barrier of silence, and whose reservoir was overfull, rose and exclaimed with the loquacity of a dam which has broken away:--
This is horrible.
She gave us her last commands.
"That is the only sort of key that fits that sort of door."
A holy death is prohibited.
"She will not listen.
I am a stone in your walls."
"Now that I think of it, Father Fauvent, let us give a whole hour to it. That is not too much.
"So be it."
"It must be closed again."
"I am entirely devoted to the convent."
"Yes, but-"
"Ah! yes, now I hear the knell, reverend Mother."
A perfect Turk!"
Two men would be better.
"That is understood.
There is no longer just nor unjust.
"The mothers have taken her to the dead room, which opens on the church."
I do not need them."
"No one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulture.
"And when the vault is open?"
"Something must be lowered into it."
"He will pay it at four o'clock to day.
At eleven o'clock exactly, I am to be in the chapel.
Be near the principal altar, with your iron bar, at eleven o'clock.
I will open the vault."
"It was Mother Crucifixion.
"More often!"
"But the inspector from the Prefecture-"
Any audience suffices for a person who has held his peace too long.
"no
"I have on my right Benoit and on my left Bernard.
Several beads of the chaplet were told off, still in silence.
"no"
"I know."
Mother Ascension will be there.
"Has the doctor for the dead paid his visit?"
"Will that be all?"
We felt that she was regaining her life in God.
Who was Bernard?
"She will not turn round."
It cut "more often" short.
Does that prevent Martin de Tours from being a saint, and giving half of his cloak to a beggar?
Each one does what he can. Because Dom Mabillon gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of Saint Bernard, while Merlonus Horstius only gives three hundred and sixty seven, I do not despise Merlonus Horstius."
"I have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in Our Lord, who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life, and who bear wonderful fruit."
"And to hold your peace about everything!"
"That is good, reverend Mother.
"It would be a good thing to have two men for it."
A silence ensued.
"A woman is never a man."
"But before that-"
"I pay no attention to any but my own."
"Yes, reverend Mother."
"So I shall have to nail up that coffin?"
The office for the dead will then be said.
His order has produced forty popes, two hundred cardinals, fifty patriarchs, sixteen hundred archbishops, four thousand six hundred bishops, four emperors, twelve empresses, forty six kings, forty one queens, three thousand six hundred canonized saints, and has been in existence for fourteen hundred years.
You will close the coffin.
"Like yourself, reverend Mother."
"The world is nothing in the presence of the cross.
Fauchelevent started.
"For that matter, no, reverend Mother."
"Reverend Mother!"
"Amen," said Fauchelevent, who imperturbably extricated himself in this manner from the dilemma, whenever he heard Latin.
"More often!"
"What do you say?"
Fauchelevent thought that it was an orison which she was finishing.
The name of Voltaire is known, but not the name of Cesar de Bus.
"I can hardly distinguish my own signal."
"And the four Mother Precentors will help you."
"About three quarters of an hour before midnight; do not forget."
A fine sight it would be, to see a man enter the dead room!"
"Reverend Mother?"
"The slab which closes the vault?"
"She will!" replied Father Fauchelevent, falling into step, and striving not to flinch again.
For a clever man like Fauchelevent, this allusion was an awkward one. Fortunately, the prioress, completely absorbed in her own thoughts, did not hear it.
All will be done in the most profound secrecy.
But my brother is the strong one, though!"
"The chapter assembled.
This was done.
"You will remove your bell.
Your sanitary department is a revolutionary invention.
"Into the vault."
"The four Mother Precentors will assist you."
However, never mind!
"I cannot work very fast.
Burial is a civil matter.
"Precisely."
The most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind.
"Three years ago, Madame de Bethune, a Jansenist, turned orthodox, merely from having seen Mother Crucifixion at prayer."
A cloister is not a dock yard."
"To limp is no sin, and perhaps it is a blessing.
"Forbidden by men, enjoined by God."
"At nine o'clock in the morning and at all hours, praised and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar," said the prioress.
"What?"
To be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel, not to go to profane earth; to remain there in death where she prayed while living; such was the last wish of Mother Crucifixion. She asked it of us; that is to say, commanded us."
"Reverend Mother, a lever at least six feet long will be required."
"It is a continuation of her slumber."
The Abbot of Citeaux, the general of the order, was councillor by right of birth to the parliament of Burgundy.
"I will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community.
But you do not understand any of the peals?"
At that moment, nine o'clock struck.
"Reverend Mother, you can hear the knell much better here than in the garden."
The sisters will carry it to the chapel.
"Mother Ascension, who is as strong as a man, will help you."
"Where?"
"Reverend Mother?"
"We may depend on you?"
"But-"
There is not a chance passer by who would not be indignant to see how we are treated.
"No other man than you can or must enter that chamber.
I have my heap of old iron at the bottom of the garden."
"The dead must be obeyed.
"What, reverend Mother?"
Who was Benoit?
"That is well."
"Yes, reverend Mother."
On one side Saint Benoit, on the other the inspector of public ways!
Between eleven o'clock and midnight, you will come with your iron bar.
We do not know that which it is necessary to know, and we know that which we should ignore.
There will be in the chapel only the four Mother Precentors, Mother Ascension and yourself."
The ancient magistracy agreed with him.
Silence, Fauvent!"
The vocal mothers, whom I have just consulted again, and who are now deliberating, have decided that Mother Crucifixion shall be buried, according to her wish, in her own coffin, under our altar.
Everything must have been completed a good quarter of an hour before that."
"You will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring."
"You will have an iron bar."
"In order to speak like you, reverend Mother."
She continued:--
"Amen," said he.
"We have only a woman here to help you.
"You know that a mother died this morning?"
"Neither do i"
On one side Saint Bernard, on the other the agent of the sanitary department!
No one thinks of hell as a reality.
Nevertheless, Cesar de Bus is a man of blessed memory, and Voltaire one of unblessed memory.
We will open the vault, we will lower the coffin, and we will close the vault again.
The state, the road commissioners, the public undertaker, regulations, the administration, what do we know of all that?
After which, there will be no trace of anything.
"But I did not say 'more often.'"
"But-"
"What if it became known?"
"Where will you obtain it?"
"Reverend Mother?"
"Merit consists in working according to one's strength.
The dead must be obeyed."
"More often than what?"
"Nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden."
"And then, the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning."
And then, religion is attacked.
"In nailing up the coffin?
"Saint Benoit two., in the matter of sepulture, resisted Constantine Pogonatus."
Fauchelevent was but ill at ease under this shower bath.
We have not even the right to give our dust to Jesus Christ!
She went on:--
"I will obey."
"I am at the orders of the very reverend community."
"Yes."
"And we are to reject the undertaker's coffin?"
I am to nail up the coffin.
"We have confidence in you."
The prioress took off several beads of her chaplet.
"It is settled, reverend Mother."
"And can you get a lever?"
The Mother Precentors will be there.
Darkness is the rule.
"Where gratings are not lacking, iron bars are not lacking.
"In her lifetime, Mother Crucifixion made converts; after her death, she will perform miracles."
Then we shall return to the cloister.
Oh! how wicked people are!
"But it is forbidden."
The peal which orders the doctor for the dead to be summoned has already been rung.
It is not necessary that the sister at the post should perceive your presence."
I am infirm; that is why I require an assistant.
"She died at daybreak."
The government will have no suspicion.
"The fact is attested by Plantavit de la Fosse."
"Under the altar."
If you had a little more faith, and if you could have been in her cell, she would have cured your leg merely by touching it. She smiled.
Let us beware of God!
The prioress continued:--
"Chonodemaire, one of the seven German kings who entered among the Gauls under the Empire of Constantius, expressly recognized the right of nuns to be buried in religion, that is to say, beneath the altar."
Why do you say more often?"
She retained her consciousness to the very last moment. She spoke to us, then she spoke to the angels.
By order of the king signifies to day, by order of the revolution. One no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead.
"Reverend Mother, I did not say more often than what, I said more often."
We live in times of terrible confusion.
Why? Because there have been bad priests, because Sagittaire, Bishop of Gap, was the brother of Salone, Bishop of Embrun, and because both of them followed Mommol.
See to that.
Only fanatics and those in error deny it.
"Hey?"
The cries of the poor blanketed wretch were so loud that they reached the ears of his master, who, halting to listen attentively, was persuaded that some new adventure was coming, until he clearly perceived that it was his squire who uttered them.
IN WHICH ARE CONTAINED THE INNUMERABLE TROUBLES WHICH THE BRAVE DON QUIXOTE AND HIS GOOD SQUIRE SANCHO PANZA ENDURED IN THE INN, WHICH TO HIS MISFORTUNE HE TOOK TO BE A CASTLE
"Thou mayest well believe that," answered Don Quixote, "because, either I know little, or this castle is enchanted, for thou must know but this that I am now about to tell thee thou must swear to keep secret until after my death."
"I say so," continued Don Quixote, "because I hate taking away anyone's good name."
This tempest and tribulation lasted about two hours, at the end of which he was left, not like his master, but so weak and exhausted that he could not stand.
"Didn't I say so? worse luck to my line!" said Sancho.
"I say," replied Sancho, "that I swear to hold my tongue about it till the end of your worship's days, and God grant I may be able to let it out tomorrow."
Sancho Panza, who also regarded the amendment of his master as miraculous, begged him to give him what was left in the pigskin, which was no small quantity.
"I would speak more politely if I were you," replied Don Quixote; "is it the way of this country to address knights errant in that style, you booby?"
"It is not for that," replied Sancho, "but because I hate keeping things long, and I don't want them to grow rotten with me from over keeping."
CHAPTER seventeen.
"Then this is an inn?" said Don Quixote.
"And a very respectable one," said the innkeeper.
"How can I sleep, curses on it!" returned Sancho discontentedly and bitterly, "when it is plain that all the devils have been at me this night?"
Pour the bisque quite hot into the tureen in which have been placed the crawfish tails, and send to the table.
Put this puree into a soup pot and finish by incorporating therewith the crawfish butter and season with a little cayenne pepper and the juice of half a lemon.
Gobey's Crab Stew
One has to come to San Francisco to partake of the king of shell fish- the mammoth Pacific crab.
When this is cooked pour it over the lobster and let all cook together for three minutes.
This question and answer might well go into the primer of information for those who come to San Francisco from the East, for what is called a lobster in San Francisco is not a lobster at all but a crayfish.
Bisque of Crawfish
King of Shell Fish
In New York City they have what they are pleased to call "Lobster Palaces," but there is not a restaurant in that great metropolis that could approach the Delmonico of San Francisco in its splendid service and its cuisine arrangements; neither could they approach the romance that always surrounded the O'Farrell street restaurant.
Pick out the crawfish and strain the broth through a napkin by pressure into a basin in order to extract all the essence from the vegetables.
Gobey ran one of those places which was not in good repute, consequently when ladies went there they were usually veiled and slipped in through an alley, but the enticement of Gobey's crab stew was too much for conventionality and his little private rooms were always full.
A dash of Worcestershire sauce just before it is taken up adds to the flavor.
Heat this in a stewpan and when simmering add the sherry and crab meat and let all cook together with a slow fire for eight minutes.
Lobster in Miniature
Probably nowhere in San Francisco could one get lobster better served than in the Old Delmonico restaurant of the days before the fire.
It is possible that she knows the secret of preparing crab as it was prepared in the Gobey's of before the fire, but his prestige did not descend to her.
Gobey's passed with the fire, and the little restaurant bearing his name, and in charge of his widow, in Union Square avenue, has not attained the fame of the old place.
Take thirty crawfish, from which remove the gut containing the gall in the following manner: Take firm hold of the crawfish with the left hand so as to avoid being pinched by its claws; with the thumb and forefinger of the right hand pinch the extreme end of the central fin of the tail, and, with a sudden jerk, the gut will be withdrawn.
Put this in a double boiler and let cook until thick, stirring constantly.
When is a lobster not a lobster?
Pound all these thoroughly together and then put them into a stewpan with the broth that has been reserved in a basin, and having warmed the bisque thus prepared rub it through a sieve into a fine puree.
When it is a crayfish.
Allow this to boil and then add a quart of strong consomme and let all continue boiling for half an hour.
Put these ingredients into a stewpan and fry them ten minutes, then throw in the crawfish and pour on them half a bottle of French white wine.
It was here that most magnificent dinners were arranged; it was here that extraordinary dishes were concocted by chefs of world-wide fame; it was here that Lobster a la Newberg reached its highest perfection, and this is the recipe that was followed when it was prepared in the Delmonico:
This is the recipe for eight people, and it is well worth trying if you are giving a dinner of importance:
Chop fine the onion, sweet pepper and tomato with the rosemary.
Soak the crab meat in the sherry two hours before cooking.
Serve in a chafing dish with thin slices of dry toast.
I say "come to San Francisco" advisedly, for while the crab is found all along the coast it is prepared nowhere so deliciously as in San Francisco.
Lobster, served cold with mayonnaise, or broiled live lobster are most frequently called for, and while they are both excellent, we find so many other ways of preparing this crustacean that we rarely take the common variety of lobster dishes into consideration.
Serve in a chafing dish with toasted crackers or thin slices of toasted bread.
Reverting to the original recipe: Take the remainder of the crawfish and add thereto three anchovies, washed for the purpose, and also the crusts of French rolls, fried to a light brown color in butter.
This butter is made as follows: Place the shells on a baking sheet in the oven to dry; let the shells cool and then pound them in a mortar with a little lobster coral and four ounces of fresh butter, thoroughly bruising the whole together so as to make a fine paste.
It is as follows:
Reserve some of the spawn, also half of the body shells with which to make the crawfish butter to finish the soup.
A book could be written about this restaurant and then all would not be told for all its secrets can never be known.
Put this in a stewpan and set it over a slow fire to simmer for about five minutes, then rub it through a sieve with considerable pressure into a basin containing ice water.
Lobsters and Lobsters
So it was agreed that we go to Damascus and fetch thence the King's son, Sharrkan, and make him Sultan over his father's realm.
If thou fear no one, I fear for thee and for my life, so Allah upon thee! recite nothing more of verses till thou come to thine own land.
When it was the Seventy second Night,
Thou must know who it was, seeing that thou art awake." The Fireman feared for Zau al Makan and said in himself, "Haply the Eunuch will do him some hurt"; so he answered, "By Allah, I know not who it was." Said the Eunuch, "By Allah, thou liest, for there is none on wake here but thou!
He who recited the first time hath recited a second time and I heard him hard by.
Indeed, I had not deemed thee so ill conditioned.
If he refuse, hand to him this purse of a thousand diners, then leave him and return to me and tell me, after thou hast informed thyself of his place and his calling and what countryman he is.
When it was the Seventy fourth Night,
Then said the Eunuch to Zau al Makan, "Peace be with thee, O my lord!"
Dost thou not know that this lady is the wife; of the Chamberlain and is minded to chastise thee for disturbing her?
Thou wottest none can stir from his place, except the watchman seize him.
Return quickly and linger not."--And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
So the Castrato began to speak him fair and say to him, "O my lord, take this purse and go with me.
I was then sitting by his side and he, seeing in her the signs of asceticism and devoutness, made her draw near and take seat hard by him.
They stand here between thy hands to do thee service, O King of the Age, and it is by trial that folk are prized or despised.
And when she had sat down she addressed him and said, 'Know, O King, that with me are five damsels, whose like no King among the Kings possesseth; for they are endowed with wit and beauty and loveliness and perfection.
They read the Koran-and the Traditions and are skilled in all manner of learning and in the history of bygone races.
The captain behaved perfectly well in this critical instant, commanding a dead silence, and the closest attention to his orders.
The question was, now, whether we could pass them or not before they got near enough to grapple.
"Mistake, sir?
I expected now to hear the guns discharged in quick succession, but they were got ready only, not fired.
I never was in a better steering ship, most especially in moderate weather.

Captain Robbins, mr Kite, bear a hand up; the bloody proas are aboard us!"
The stillness that reigned on both sides was like that of death.
Are numbers essential to the rightness of a cause?
This conclusion is possible and in many ways attractive, but it is beset with serious difficulties.
The later traditions tend to extend the period.
Do the earliest Hebrew traditions imply that the ancestors of the Israelites were worshippers of Jehovah?
The Biblical narratives apparently disagree regarding the duration of the sojourn in Egypt.
THE TRAINING OF A STATESMAN.
The excavations also laid bare a great square brick wall with the ruins of store chambers inside.
But Moses fled from the presence of Pharaoh and took up his abode in the land of Midian.
Furthermore, the Egyptian historians never distinguished the different races in their midst, but rather designated the foreign serf class by a common name.

THE MAKING OF A LOYAL PATRIOT.
Apparently their rebellious attitude also increased the burden which was placed upon them.
A contemporary inscription also states that he founded near Pithum the house of Ramses, a city with a royal residence and temples.
The wilderness to the east of Egypt had for centuries been the place of refuge for Egyptian fugitives.
When, therefore, Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to him Moses.
The story of Moses' birth and early childhood is one of the most interesting chapters in Biblical history.
The cruel fate of his people and the painful experience in Egypt that had driven him into the wilderness prepared his mind to receive this training.
THE SCHOOL OF THE WILDERNESS.
THE EGYPTIAN BACKGROUND OF THE BONDAGE.
Hold on; hold fast: hold out-patience is genius.
Do you intend to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?
On one occasion he was at saint Mary's Church, Nottingham, for a confirmation.
This was an infrequent material for tobacco pipes, but there are a few examples in museums.
No one knew what might happen next.
This letter was addressed to james Granger, and was published in Granger's correspondence.
Knockdunder's pipe, according to Scott, was made of iron.
The affair happened in saint Mary's Church at Nottingham, when Archbishop Blackbourn (of York) was there on a visitation.
Blackburn, Archbishop of York, was a great smoker.
Oh, well, then I can do it in twenty minutes.
The family doctor gave her cod liver oil, then iron, then nitrate of silver, but as the first and the second and the third were alike in doing no good, and as his advice when spring came was to go abroad, a celebrated physician was called in.
And there are indications; malnutrition, nervous excitability, and so on.
"Beg pardon, is the Yausky bridge done yet, or shall I have to drive around?" he asked.
The question stands thus: in presence of indications of tuberculous process, what is to be done to maintain nutrition?"
This is the third time you've asked me the same thing."
I will talk it over with my colleague, and then I will have the honor of laying my opinion before you."
"Oh! time's up already," And he went to the door.
"And how about a tour abroad?" asked the family doctor.
"Well, doctor?"
"Is there hope?" she meant to say, but her lips quivered, and she could not utter the question.
"I've no liking for foreign tours.
But we may suspect it.
the doctor plunged into deep meditation, as though resolving a weighty problem. Finally his decision was pronounced: they were to go abroad, but to put no faith in foreign quacks, and to apply to him in any need.
So we were saying the problem may be put thus: to maintain nutrition and to give tone to the nerves.
Before her he decided to scatter his pearls.
And the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess, as an exceptionally intelligent woman, the condition of the young princess, and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters, which were certainly harmless.
He perceived that it was no good talking to the old man, and that the principal person in the house was the mother.
"Come this way."
She had been ill, and as spring came on she grew worse.
"So we had better leave you?"
All her illness and treatment struck her as a thing so stupid, ludicrous even!
"Tell me everything."
It seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the doctor had gone.
The doctor was meantime with difficulty restraining the expression of his contempt for this old gentleman, and with difficulty condescending to the level of his intelligence.
"Yes, that's an understood thing," responded the celebrated physician, again glancing at his watch.
"Immediately, princess.
"As you please."
He sat down with a smile, facing her, felt her pulse, and again began asking her tiresome questions.
The mother was much more cheerful when she went back to her daughter, and Kitty pretended to be more cheerful.
The prince withdrew, trying not to show how ridiculous he thought the whole performance.
"Well, doctor, decide our fate," said the princess.
The family doctor listened attentively and respectfully.
But she could not grieve her mother, especially as her mother considered herself to blame.
The celebrated physician, a very handsome man, still youngish, asked to examine the patient.
She felt she had sinned against Kitty.
Her heart was broken. Why would they try to cure her with pills and powders?
"Oh, no, only a few details, princess."
The family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his observations.
"But..."
The celebrated doctor did not take offense.
"Conceited blockhead!" he thought, as he listened to the celebrated doctor's chatter about his daughter's symptoms.
Wasted and flushed, with a peculiar glitter in her eyes, left there by the agony of shame she had been put through, Kitty stood in the middle of the room.
They ought to be persuaded....
"However, I had finished..."
The celebrated doctor announced to the princess (a feeling of what was due from him dictated his doing so) that he ought to see the patient once more.
At the end of the winter, in the Shtcherbatskys' house, a consultation was being held, which was to pronounce on the state of Kitty's health and the measures to be taken to restore her failing strength.
The prince frowned and coughed, listening to the doctor.
"But in favor of foreign travel I would urge the change of habits, the removal from conditions calling up reminiscences.
The princess was distracted, and did not know what to do.
She answered him, and all at once got up, furious.
When the doctor came in she flushed crimson, and her eyes filled with tears.
Doctoring her seemed to her as absurd as putting together the pieces of a broken vase.
"Excuse me, doctor, but there is really no object in this.
Chapter one
And the mother, accompanied by the doctor, went into the drawing room to Kitty.
"Ah! it is.
"Yes," said he.
"The commencement of the tuberculous process we are not, as you are aware, able to define; till there are cavities, there is nothing definite.
Only, those German quacks are mischievous....
Well, in that case, to be sure, let them go.
This argument too was well founded only some centuries ago.
But we know this is what all governments say of one another, and yet we know that all the European nations profess the same principles of liberty and fraternity, and therefore stand in no need of protection against one another.
The army has always been and still is the basis of power.
"Except for the state," they tell us, "we should not have any religion, education, culture, means of communication, and so on. Without the state men would not have been able to form the social institutions needed for doing any thing."
In our day governments not only fail to encourage, but directly hinder every movement by which people try to work out new forms of life for themselves.
All the methods of appointing authorities that have been tried, divine right, and election, and heredity, and balloting, and assemblies and parliaments and senate-have all proved ineffectual.
The larger and stronger groups conquered and absorbed the weaker, and the larger and stronger they became, the more internal feuds disappeared and the more the continuity of the group seemed assured.
To resist would need independent thought and effort of which every man is not capable.
And by this means all citizens are under arms to support the iniquities practiced upon them; all citizens have become their own oppressors.
The effect of moral influence on a man is to change his desires and to bend them in the direction of the duty required of him. The man who is controlled by moral influence acts in accordance with his own desires.
Indeed, it could not be otherwise.
This, put simply, is how it has come to pass.
Internal dissensions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression exerted by the authority over the dissentient individuals.
And for the sake of what am I making them?
That has always been necessary, and has become more and more necessary with the increased diffusion of education among the masses, with the improved communication between people of the same and of different nationalities.
The members of a family or tribe, united into one community, are less hostile among themselves, and families and tribes do not die like one man, but have a continuity of existence.
But the fatal significance of universal military service, as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent in the social conception of life, is not only apparent in that.
Both causes, mutually dependent, contribute to the same result at once; troops are required against internal forces and also to keep up a position with other states.
As the disposition of individuals to violence diminished, and as the habits of the people became more civilized, and as power grew more social organization demoralized through lack of restraint, this advantage disappeared.
Governments feel that it is so, and strengthen the force of their disciplined armies.
In the German Reichstag not long ago, in reply to a question why funds were needed for raising the salaries of the under officers, the German Chancellor openly declared that trustworthy under officers were necessary to contend against socialism.
It was produced, on one hand, by the natural growth of population, and, on the other, by struggle and conquest.
Everyone, if he does not recognize this now, will know that it is so at the first attempt at insubordination or at a revolution of the existing order.
Anyone who serves his time in the army shares the responsibility of all these things, about which he is, in some cases, dubious, while very often they are directly opposed to his conscience.
People have believed, as though it were something fully proved, and so needing no proof, that since all nations have hitherto developed in the form of states, that form of organization is an indispensable condition of the development of humanity.
And this abnormal order of things is maintained by the army.
Government authority, even if it does suppress private violence, always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence, which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the government.
Every government is thus involuntarily reduced to the necessity of emulating one another in the increase of their armies.
But who are these evil disposed persons in our midst from whose attacks we are preserved by the state and its army?
The power of the state, far from being a security against the attacks of our neighbors, exposes us, on the contrary, to much greater danger of such attacks.
It has become particularly indispensable now in the face of communism, socialism, anarchism, and the labor movement generally.
How can I help asking myself when I take part in such punishments, whether they are just, and whether I ought to assist in carrying them out?
And therefore the oppression of the oppressed always goes on growing up to the furthest limit, beyond which it cannot go without killing the goose with the golden eggs.
In the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals, individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interests for the interests of the group.
Governments assert that armies are needed above all for external defense, but that is not true.
But there is not only one government.
All civil outbreaks for dynastic or other party reasons, all the executions that follow on such disturbances, all repression of insurrections, and military intervention to break up meetings and to suppress strikes, all forced extortion of taxes, all the iniquitous distributions of land, all the restrictions on labor-are either carried out directly by the military or by the police with the army at their back.
I am expected for the sake of the state to make these sacrifices, to renounce everything that can be precious to man-peace, family, security, and human dignity." What is this state, for whose sake such terrible sacrifices have to be made?
And why is it so indispensably necessary?
"Except for the state," they say, "we should be exposed to the attacks of evil disposed persons in our own country."
Such has been and still is the condition of all the oppressed, but hitherto they have not recognized the fact.
One is the result of the other. The despotism of a government always increases with the strength of the army and its external successes, and the aggressiveness of a government increases with its internal despotism.
Even apart from the moral significance of compliance or non compliance, considering material advantage only, non compliance will be more advantageous in general.
The time has come when the ever growing abuse of power by governments and their struggles with one another has led to their demanding such material and even moral sacrifices from their subjects that everyone is forced to reflect and ask himself, "Can I make these sacrifices?
In spite of the fact that the sense of the uselessness and even injurious effects of state violence is more and more penetrating into men's consciousness, things might have gone on in the same way forever if governments were not under the necessity of constantly increasing their armies in order to maintain their power.
The comparative advantages of compliance and non compliance are as follows:
Power is always in the hands of those who control the army, and all men in power-from the Roman Caesars to the Russian and German Emperors-take more interest in their army than in anything, and court popularity in the army, knowing that if that is on their side their power is secure.
Indeed government is more often an obstacle than an assistance in attaining these aims.
The danger of war, ever ready to break out, renders all reforms of life social life vain and fruitless.
Every increase in the army of one state, with the aim of self defense against its subjects, becomes a source of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies.
But instead of doing that they expose the individuals to the same necessity of strife, substituting strife with individuals of other states for strife with neighbors.
And if defense against barbarous nations is meant, one thousandth part of the troops now under arms would be amply sufficient for that purpose.
So it has always been.
This is absolutely incorrect.
The taxes raised from the people for war preparations absorb the greater part of the produce of labor which the army ought to defend.
The possibility of applying bodily violence to people is provided above all by an organization of armed men, trained to act in unison in submission to one will.
In submitting they simply yield to the suggestions given them as orders, without thought or effort of will.
And if the goose lays no more eggs, like the American Indians, negroes, and Fijians, then it is killed in spite of the sincere protests of philanthropists.
Caprivi incautiously gave utterance to what everyone knows perfectly well, or at least feels vaguely if he does not recognize it, that is, that the existing order of life is as it is, not, as would be natural and right, because the people wish it to be so, but because it is so maintained by state violence, by the army with its BOUGHT UNDER OFFICERS and generals.
Universal military service was an inevitable logical necessity, to which we were bound to come.
Only under those conditions could the social organization be justified.
The most convincing example of this is to be found in the condition of the working classes of our epoch, who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient times subdued by conquest.
The government, they tell us, with its army, is necessary to defend us from neighboring states who might enslave us.
To keep their subjects in oppression and to be able to enjoy the fruits of their labor the government must have armed forces.
Nothing can oblige a man to do what he does not choose except physical force, or the threat of it, that is-deprivation of freedom, blows, imprisonment, or threats-easily carried out-of such punishments.
So it was under the Roman emperors and so it is now.
"Without governments nations would be enslaved by their neighbors."
These bands of armed men, submissive to a single will, are what constitute the army.
And so every government needs an army also to protect its booty from its neighbor brigands.
Caprivi only said aloud what every statesman knows and assiduously conceals from the people.
The social conception of life, we have seen, consists in the transfer of the aim of life from the individual to groups and their maintenance-to the tribe, family, race, or state.
Even looking at it practically, weighing, that is to say, all the burdens laid on him by the state, no man can fail to see that for him personally to comply with state demands and serve in the army, would, in the majority of cases, be more disadvantageous than to refuse to do so.
The basis of authority is bodily violence.
After conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to internal dissensions, and so the state conception of life justifies itself. But this justification is never more than temporary.
The champions of the social conception of life usually try to connect the idea of authority, that is, of violence, with the idea of moral influence, but this connection is quite impossible.
So much for the comparative disadvantages.
And so it has been, and still is, in fact, in certain groups, the distinction being that they are the most primitive forms of association in the family or tribe or race, or even in the patriarchal state.
This inconsistency has become obvious in universal military service.
[See Footnote]
The withdrawing of all men from the ordinary course of life destroys the possibility of labor itself.
Authority, in the sense in which the word is ordinarily understood, is a means of forcing a man to act in opposition to his desires.
The meaning of Caprivi's speech, put into plain language, is that funds are needed, not to resist foreign foes, but to BUY UNDER OFFICERS to be ready to act against the enslaved toiling masses.
So that the justification of state violence on the ground of the protection it gives us from evil disposed persons, even if it had some foundation three or four centuries ago, has none whatever now.
It is scarcely necessary to refute this last argument.
If the majority of men choose to submit rather than to refuse, it is not the result of sober balancing of advantages and disadvantages, but because they are induced by a kind of hypnotizing process practiced upon them.
They are booing some one now!
"But surely that sort of thing is provided by his supporters and admirers?" said the Prime Minister; "we can hardly be supposed to supply a released prisoner with a brass band.
"That, of course," said the Government Prosecutor, springing to his feet, "is equivalent to an acquittal?"
Hence the anxiety in the crowded Court, and in the little groups gathered round the tape machines in Whitehall and Downing Street and other affected centres.
Despite the earliness of the hour a small crowd had gathered in the street outside, and the horrible menacing Trelawney refrain of the "Fifteen Hundred Voting Men" came in a steady, monotonous chant.
The day after the trial there was to be a by-election at Nemesis on Hand, and it had been openly announced in the division that if Platterbaff were languishing in gaol on polling day the Government candidate would be "outed" to a certainty.
"He won't go unless he has a brass band.
"What tune would you prefer?" he asked Platterbaff.
Is Platterbaff out yet?
"Won't go?
The verdict and sentence were made known to the public at twenty minutes past five in the afternoon; at half past five a dense crowd was massed outside the Prime Minister's residence lustily singing, to the air of "Trelawney":
"I hardly think so," said the Judge, coldly; "I feel obliged to sentence the prisoner to a week's imprisonment."
The crowd outside chanted with an increasing volume of sound:
Of course any sentence which the law might feel compelled to inflict would be followed by an immediate pardon, but it was highly desirable, from the Government's point of view, that the necessity for such an exercise of clemency should not arise.
"I'll try," said the Home Secretary, and went to the telephone.
"Fifteen hundred," said the Prime Minister, with a shudder; "it's too horrible to think of.
The telephone squealed shrilly; it was a trunk call from Nemesis.
"Will vote the other way."
A telegram was brought in.
"The popular song of the moment," replied the Agitator after a moment's reflection.
"He won't go!" he exclaimed.
At half past seven the next morning the Prime Minister and the Chief Organiser sat at breakfast, making a perfunctory meal, and awaiting the return of the Home Secretary, who had gone in person to superintend the releasing of Platterbaff.
Without a band he would not go; and they had no band.
The foreman delivered his message:
It was a scandalous sentence, but then the Judge was not on the Ministerial side in politics.
It was from the central committee rooms at Nemesis.
"Seven thirty," amended the Prime Minister; "we must avoid any appearance of precipitancy."
"Lend us the instruments," said the Chief Organiser.
The seat was lost, but Ministers had scored a moral victory.
The jury returned from considering their verdict; there was a flutter, an excited murmur, a deathlike hush.
He said it was our only chance of getting a telegram 'Radprop is In' to night."
The local Trade Unionists took offence at the fact of Cabinet Ministers having personally acted as strike breakers, and even the release of Platterbaff failed to pacify them.
Platterbaff must have his band."
"Losing twenty votes per minute," was its brief message.
A constant stream of telegraph boys poured in through the prison gates.
"This is not a moment for standing on dignity," he observed bluntly; "musicians must be supplied at once.
Eight o'clock struck.
The jury wish to add a rider drawing attention to the fact that a by-election is pending in the Parliamentary division of Nemesis on Hand."
The Chief Organiser rang off.
The Home Secretary entered the room a moment later, disaster written on his face.
"The jury find the prisoner guilty of blowing up the Albert Hall.
That must be McKenna."
"The warders have a private band of their own," said the Governor, "but of course I couldn't allow the men themselves-"
A quarter past ten, half past.
"They will cheer presently when they hear the news," said the Prime Minister hopefully; "hark!
"And may the Lord have mercy on the poll," a Junior Counsel exclaimed irreverently.
In Heaven's name, why-"
There's a musicians' strike on, I suppose you know."
Ten o'clock struck.
"Yamley's factory hands just voted you can guess how," ran a despairing message, and the others were all of the same tenour.
"Have you any band instruments of an easy nature to play?" demanded the Chief Organiser of the Prison Governor; "drums, cymbals, those sort of things?"
Nemesis was going the way of Reading.
The seat was lost, after all, by a narrow majority.
It was a tune they had all heard hundreds of times, so there was no difficulty in turning out a passable imitation of it.
We keep the drawing room locked up at night, of course, but anything might be carried off while we are at breakfast."
"A diplomat like you will know how to treat this as if it hadn't happened.
Besides, cynicism apart, his being rich will make a difference in the way people will look at his failing.
From his late schooldays onward he had been possessed by an acute and obstinate form of kleptomania; he had the acquisitive instinct of the collector without any of the collector's discrimination.
And the reputation was an unpleasant one.
"The mean pig hasn't brought us a present, and I'm hanged if he shall carry one off."
I thought I'd get it changed for something else, and now it's gone."
Signed 'Wilfrid Pigeoncote.' Must be the Snatcher; none of the others have a motor.
Something's been taken out of my portmanteau.
The Snatcher had been an orphan these many years.
Wilfrid occupied himself chiefly with such of the gifts as were of antique interest, carrying one or two of them over to the lamp to examine their marks.
And they had rifled and despoiled his portmanteau!
We feel that we must live on cream for the rest of our lives.
"With that notorious failing of his he was not the sort of person one wanted in one's house."
"Brave little woman," said peter, with a gasp of relief; "I could never have done it."
After they had said "Good night" to their visitor, mrs peter expressed her conviction that he had taken something.
Diplomatic reticence does not necessarily extend to family affairs.
"Well, we can hardly expect to," he replied, "seeing that we always choked him off from coming to see us when he was a prospective nobody.
A few duplicates, of course."
"I fancy, by his manner, that there was something up," corroborated her husband; "do you miss anything?"
In the drawing room, after dinner, their nervousness and awkwardness increased.
When a man is absolutely wealthy, not merely well to do, all suspicion of sordid motive naturally disappears; the thing becomes merely a tiresome malady."
Of course, some of them can be changed."
"There are eight cream jugs now, instead of seven," she cried; "this one wasn't there before.
Husband and wife looked blankly and desperately at one another.
"There was a reason for not wanting to encourage his acquaintanceship," said mrs peter.
"We must keep a sharp look out, that's all," said peter reassuringly.
mrs peter kept guard outside, while her husband first made a hurried and successful search for the keys, and then plunged at the portmanteau with the air of a disagreeably conscientious Customs official.
The doctors have a special name for it.
I suppose he's bringing us a present for the silver wedding."
mrs peter had a final inspiration.
mrs peter broke off in some confusion, and tripped out to meet her husband in the hall.
Don't say anything more about it."
"Seven cream jugs," put in peter.
"Yes, my mother's at Cairo just now, and she wrote to me at Dresden to try and get you something quaint and pretty in the old silver line, and I pitched on this cream jug."
It was mrs peter who arrived first at an inspiration.
"How on earth are we to know?" said peter.
Some one had taken it while I was away from the room."
"Oh, we haven't shown you the silver wedding presents," said mrs peter, suddenly, as though struck by a brilliant idea for entertaining the guest; "here they all are.
The search usually produced a large and varied yield.
You must have slipped downstairs with it last night and put it there before we locked up, and forgotten all about having done it in the morning."
The talk flitted nervously and hurriedly from one impersonal topic to another.
Vigilance was not completely crowned with a sense of victory.
He must have pounced on your portmanteau the moment you went to your bath, and taken the first thing he came across.
mrs peter turned to her guest with confidential coyness.
"It's all right," she whispered to him; "I've explained everything.
"Only the other day I went into the town to pay a bill, and went in again next day, having clean forgotten that I'd-"
Wilfrid was late in coming down to breakfast, and his manner showed plainly that something was amiss.
The Pigeoncotes had turned paler than ever.
"Oh, of course, there is still that drawback," admitted the wife, "but one would like to make the acquaintance of the future head of the family, if only out of mere curiosity.
Quick, fly down with it and put it back among the others."
Both the Pigeoncotes had turned deadly pale.
His hosts, on the other hand, wore an uneasy manner that might have been the hallmark of conscious depravity.
"Sorry.
It was a little present from my mother and myself for your silver wedding.
The mention of Dresden had thrown a sudden light on the situation.
What a curious trick of memory, mr Wilfrid!
"I suppose we shall never see Wilfred Pigeoncote here now that he has become heir to the baronetcy and to a lot of money," observed mrs peter Pigeoncote regretfully to her husband.
"Good Lord!
Before Tom could make the slightest struggle, the Chouette had emptied his pockets with singular dexterity.
"At one o'clock."
By means of this stratagem they followed so closely, that, although within a few steps of Sarah and Tom, they did not hear them.
Do not follow us, or else-"
Are you not cold, Sarah?"
The two monsters took off their shoes, and moved stealthily along, keeping in the shadows of the houses.
Perhaps his detestation of the Schoolmaster and the Chouette might have something to do with this feeling.
"Opposite saint Ouen, at the end of the road of La Revolte, the plain is wide and open.
"Let us take off our shoes, and then they won't hear us as we follow," suggested the Chouette.
His steps, which were somewhat irregular, in consequence of the frequent libations of the evening, were soon unheard amidst the whistling of the storm and the sheets of rain which dashed against the walls.
"Wretch!
"I will bring your pocketbook."
"Be it so; to morrow at one."
"A dandy with moustaches?
Yes, I would have stuck it into the fellow, but he did not give me time.
Old boy, it will pay for looking after."
The Chourineur resolved to inform Rodolph of the danger which threatened him; but how?
"But he'll trap you, Chouette."
What a shame!"
"And you shall have the five hundred francs I promised you, and we will agree in the other matter, if you are reasonable."
A concealed witness had been present at this transaction; it was the Chourineur, who had entered the cellars of the house to get shelter from the rain.
"Be off, without looking behind you, and be thankful that you have escaped so well."
"I am glad they have gone that way," said the Schoolmaster, "for if the 'cove' resists, I have my own idea."
Across the fields, one may see a long way.
I do not seek his life," replied Sarah to the Schoolmaster.
In an instant, the Schoolmaster, with a leap resembling in strength and agility the spring of a tiger, seized Seyton with one hand by the throat, and exclaimed, "Your money, or I will fling you into this hole!"
"One moment," said the Chouette; "if he behaves well, he shall have his pocketbook.
"What, then, would you have?"
"Yes."
"Oh, no, he won't; I'm up to him or any of his dodges.
Then the brigand, pushing Seyton backwards, shoved him off his balance, and with one hand held him suspended over the mouth of the deep excavation; whilst, with his other hand, he grasped the arm of Sarah, as if in a vice.
I will not give you one thousand, but two thousand, francs, if you succeed."
"Will you strike a bargain?
"I do."
We can see a long way off.
A sudden idea seemed to strike Sarah, and she said to the brigand, "Will you like to gain some money?"
Fire and smoke!
I have only one eye, but that is a piercer; and if the 'cove' comes with a companion, he won't find anybody; I shall have 'mizzled.'"
"They're done for," said the Schoolmaster, in a low key, to the Chouette; "out with your vitriol, and mind your eye."
CHAPTER seven.
He had forgotten the address of the self styled fan painter.
Tom Seyton did not lose his presence of mind during this scene, rapidly and unexpectedly as it had occurred.
My pocketbook contains papers quite useless to you; return it to me, and to morrow I will give you twenty five louis d'ors," said Tom to the Schoolmaster, whose hand relaxed something of its fierce gripe.
Hand me the cash, and I will hand you the pocketbook."
We must turn back."
"Yes."
No," said the old brute, grumblingly, "no, not one ring.
I would go, if I were you.
The proposal which Sarah made to the brigand respecting Rodolph deeply interested the Chourineur, who, alarmed for the perils which appeared about to beset his new friend, regretted that he could not warn him of them.
He stunned me with two blows of his fists, and upset me on the table,--for the first time that any man ever did so. Curses on him! but I will be revenged."
"Agreed."
"Perhaps we shall glean something from this smuggler,--this Bras Rouge," said Sarah, in a thoughtful tone, and not replying to her brother's inquiry.
The Chourineur got up behind, and at one o'clock it stopped on the Boulevard de l'Observatoire, and Thomas and Sarah went down a narrow entrance, which was close at hand.
"Because you have the order of Charles the third., and you wish to announce the good news to me?"
What do I say?
The salon down stairs was only an Algerian divan, for the use of smokers.
"And makes you resemble the Prince of Wales or the Duke of Reichstadt."
At the Bois de Boulogne, ennui and hunger attacked me at once,--two enemies who rarely accompany each other, and who are yet leagued against me, a sort of Carlo republican alliance.
"Come, do not affect indifference, but confess you were pleased to have it."
"Ah, true; you drive Don Carlos out of Spain."
What these stuffs did there, it was impossible to say; they awaited, while gratifying the eyes, a destination unknown to their owner himself; in the meantime they filled the place with their golden and silky reflections.
"No, my dear fellow," returned the young man, seating himself on the divan; "reassure yourself; we are tottering always, but we never fall, and I begin to believe that we shall pass into a state of immobility, and then the affairs of the Peninsula will completely consolidate us."
It looks very neat on a black coat buttoned up."
Take a cigar."
"A quarter to ten."
On the walls, over the doors, on the ceiling, were swords, daggers, Malay creeses, maces, battle axes; gilded, damasked, and inlaid suits of armor; dried plants, minerals, and stuffed birds, their flame colored wings outspread in motionless flight, and their beaks forever open.
At the end of a long corridor, with which the door communicated, and which formed the ante chamber, was, on the right, Albert's breakfast room, looking into the court, and on the left the salon, looking into the garden.
"Very well, at half past ten.
"And you another order, for I see you have a blue ribbon at your button hole."
However, the morning of the appointment, the young man had established himself in the small salon down stairs.
Shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows, and hid from the garden and court these two apartments, the only rooms into which, as they were on the ground floor, the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate.
punctuality!
Take her six bottles of different wine-Cyprus, sherry, and Malaga, and a barrel of Ostend oysters; get them at Borel's, and be sure you say they are for me."
"Yes; they sent me the order of Charles the third.," returned Debray, carelessly.
I returned home at daybreak, and strove to sleep; but my head ached and I got up to have a ride for an hour.
It was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the house was built, so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt; but the well oiled hinges and locks told quite another story.
"It is for that reason you see me so early."
"Let Madame Danglars know that I accept the place she offers me in her box.
The Guests.
"What time is it now?"
Besides, that does not concern the home but the financial department.
"Peste, I will do nothing of the kind; the moment they come from government you would find them execrable.
"Oh, it is very well as a finish to the toilet.
"One by the post, Madame Danglars' footman left the other."
I then recollected you gave a breakfast this morning, and here I am.
Two windows only of the pavilion faced the street; three other windows looked into the court, and two at the back into the garden.
"No, no, my dear fellow, do not confound our plans.
I am hungry, feed me; I am bored, amuse me."
Has the ministry resigned?"
On the floor above were similar rooms, with the addition of a third, formed out of the ante chamber; these three rooms were a salon, a boudoir, and a bedroom.
"No, because I passed the night writing letters,--five and twenty despatches.
Is the countess up yet?"
In the meantime, my dear Lucien, here are cigars-contraband, of course-try them, and persuade the minister to sell us such instead of poisoning us with cabbage leaves."
"How did these letters come?" said he.
"And what would you do, my dear diplomatist," replied Morcerf, with a slight degree of irony in his voice, "if you did nothing?
"Yes, ask her for one of her liqueur cellarets, mine is incomplete; and tell her I shall have the honor of seeing her about three o'clock, and that I request permission to introduce some one to her." The valet left the room.
This was Albert's favorite lounging place.
You, whom I expected last, you arrive at five minutes to ten, when the time fixed was half past!
"If you wish, I will inquire."
Wait; then, during the day, tell Rosa that when I leave the Opera I will sup with her as she wishes.
"My dear Franz," replied Albert, "when, upon receipt of my letter, you found the necessity of asking the count's assistance, you promptly went to him, saying, 'My friend Albert de Morcerf is in danger; help me to deliver him.' Was not that nearly what you said?"
"Did you ever meet him previously to coming hither?"
"Yes."
"Still," persisted Franz, "I suppose you will allow that such men as Vampa and his band are regular villains, who have no other motive than plunder when they seize your person.
"Day for day, hour for hour," said Albert; "that will suit me to a dot."
"I fear I shall not have that honor."
"Is it possible," exclaimed Albert, "that you have reached your present age without visiting the finest capital in the world?
"I will confess to you, Albert," replied Franz, "the count is a very singular person, and the appointment you have made to meet him in Paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions."
Why, you must have lost your senses."
"Why, really the thing seems to me simple enough.
"I promise."
"Whether I am in my senses or not," answered Franz, "that is the way I feel."
"So distinguished an individual as yourself," cried Albert, "could scarcely have required an introduction."
"Oh, pray name it."
"What is the matter?" asked Albert of Franz, when they had returned to their own apartments; "you seem more than commonly thoughtful."
"I reside in my father's house, but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the court yard, entirely separated from the main building."
Albert listened with the most profound attention.
"Upon my honor."
"I confess he asked me none."
"So be it, then," replied the count, and extending his hand towards a calendar, suspended near the chimney piece, he said, "to day is the twenty first of February;" and drawing out his watch, added, "it is exactly half past ten o'clock.
"Possibly."
"That depends; when do you leave?"
The first words that Albert uttered to his friend, on the following morning, contained a request that Franz would accompany him on a visit to the count; true, the young man had warmly and energetically thanked the count on the previous evening; but services such as he had rendered could never be too often acknowledged.
"Well," said he, when Franz had concluded, "what do you find to object to in all you have related?
"Where do you live?"
Now, then, Franz, when, for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered, he but asks me in return to do for him what is done daily for any Russian prince or Italian nobleman who may pass through Paris-merely to introduce him into society-would you have me refuse?
"To morrow evening, at five o'clock."
"I have."
And now, my dear Franz, let us talk of something else.
"Upon your honor?"
"It was."
"In that case I must say adieu to you, as I am compelled to go to Naples, and shall not return hither before Saturday evening or Sunday morning.
"When do you propose going thither?"
"My very good friend and excellent neighbor," replied the count, with a smile, "you really exaggerate my trifling exertions.
"Nay," said the Count; "I will give you three months ere I join you; you see I make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties.
"And in three months' time," said Albert, "you will be at my house?"
At last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding night, and the embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum required, and finally of his application to the count and the picturesque and satisfactory result that followed.
How do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians?"
"I pledge you my honor," returned the count, "that I mean to do as I have said; both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit Paris."
"No; he merely came and freed me from the hands of Signor Vampa, where, I can assure you, in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and unconcern, I did not very particularly care to remain.
"Connected by marriage, you mean," said Franz, laughingly.
I hope my coming will not put you to any inconvenience."
"He is a philanthropist," answered the other; "and no doubt his motive in visiting Paris is to compete for the Monthyon prize, given, as you are aware, to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the interests of virtue and humanity.
If my vote and interest can obtain it for him, I will readily give him the one and promise the other.
"Well," said Franz with a sigh, "do as you please my dear viscount, for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation.
Perhaps by the time you return to Paris, I shall be quite a sober, staid father of a family!
"Then we shall not meet in Paris?"
"No, for Venice; I shall remain in Italy for another year or two."
Have you anything particular against him?"
The count is fond of travelling, and, being rich, possesses a vessel of his own.
Still, in spite of all, you must admit that this Count of Monte Cristo is a most singular personage."
"Have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself?"
But as regards your wish to visit our fine city, my dear count, I can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please."
"Now then," said the count, returning his tablets to his pocket, "make yourself perfectly easy; the hand of your time piece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself."
"For France?"
"But," said Franz, "the Corsican bandits that were among the crew of his vessel?"
"Upon my word," said Albert, "I deserve no credit for what I could not help, namely, a determination to take everything as I found it, and to let those bandits see, that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world, there is no nation but the French that can smile even in the face of grim Death himself.
Certainly these are questions that, in your place, I should like to have answered."
Come, shall we take our luncheon, and then pay a last visit to saint Peter's?" Franz silently assented; and the following afternoon, at half past five o'clock, the young men parted.
"Have you bachelor's apartments there?
"And where?"
Then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the Colosseum, between the count and Vampa, in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit Peppino,--an engagement which, as our readers are aware, he most faithfully fulfilled.
Albert de Morcerf to return to Paris, and Franz d'Epinay to pass a fortnight at Venice.
"Certainly I have; in a fortnight or three weeks' time, that is to say, as fast as I can get there!"
what are his means of existence?
The young men then rose, and bowing to the count, quitted the room.
"Monsieur de Morcerf," replied the count, "your offer, far from surprising me, is precisely what I expected from you, and I accept it in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is made;--nay, I will go still further, and say that I had previously made up my mind to ask a great favor at your hands."
"I am wholly a stranger to Paris-it is a city I have never yet seen."
"Shall I see you again ere my departure?" asked Albert.
"Capital," exclaimed Albert; "your breakfast shall be waiting."
Of all the fierce little tartars!
If I had been in uniform, she would not have dared."
I'll soon show them that I am not going to be played with.
I know!"
There was a low wailing sound which troubled the midshipman, and he said quickly,--
"Oh!"
"Can you not believe me?
Yes, if other ways failed, he could escape up the chimney.
Then all round the room.
"You are making a mistake," said Archy softly.
Pray, pray, say you will not!"
"Why don't you speak, sir?"
"What else can I do?" replied Archy sadly.
To do this he must scheme, lie hid till morning, then make for the nearest point, and signal for help, unless a boat's crew were already searching for him.
I don't know," said Archy.
It is not my father's doing.
I am on duty.
"Oh!"
Nothing else in the room, as far as he could make out in the darkness, and if those wretched bars had only been away, how soon he could have escaped!
"What am I to say?
They had a valuable cargo hidden in the cellar beneath where he stood, and themselves to save, and naturally they would not hesitate to deal hardly with him, when quite a young, apparently gentle girl treated him as she had done.
You shall not tell.
He could not help it.
"That my father, Sir Risdon Graeme, has smuggled goods here?"
There was a cry and a quick rustling toward the door.
He went and tried to force his head through, recalling as he did that where a person's head would go the rest of the body would pass.
"I suppose so.
Cold water came on this idea directly, as he recalled the fact that the darkness was intense, and Celia could not have seen him.
But, all right!
There was a sound of breath being drawn sharply through the teeth, and then the voice seemed changed as the next words came,--
Looked such a nice, lady like girl, and all the time she's a female smuggler, and must have been sitting up to let them in, and lock up after the rascals had done."
But there was no chance for his body there, the head would not go first.
"I wish you would believe me, that I am in as great trouble about it as you are."
Then an easy chair.
"Who are you?"
"Well," said Archy, as there was no further sound heard, "I'm not going to put up with this.
"And I meant to save them from trouble if I could, out of respect for them all, and did not believe that such people could stoop to be mixed up with rogues and smugglers.
On the whole, he decided that it would not be pleasant to be knocked about.
There was a low burst of sobbing, and the young midshipman felt his own breast swell.
"Then, why are you here?
"Yes-yes-speak!"
I was trying to find out about the smugglers."
A narrow table against the wall in two places.
A chair or two.
And if he did, it would only be to reach the roof of the house, and perhaps find no way down.
"But you will go and tell all you have found out?"
CHAPTER TWELVE.
"But your men.
"And-and-you have not found out anything?" came in quick, frightened tones.
I'll soon rattle some one up;" and he went sharply to the door, felt for the handle, tried it, and was about to shake it and bang at the panels, when discretion got the better of valour.
No, that was too bad.
I did not come to frighten you; you frightened me."
"Do you know what this means?"
How to escape?
Next moment, as he felt his way about, his hand touched an old-fashioned marble mantelpiece.
"A fellow who was shut up in prison for life might do it," he said, "but not in a case like this."
Sympathy and pity for the dwellers in the Hoze were completely gone now, and he set his teeth fast, and mentally called himself a weak idiot for ever thinking about such people.
"I was obliged to come.
You saw me and spoke to me to day when the dog came at me."
He hates the smugglers.
"I never did!" he exclaimed, after standing listening for a few minutes to see if the girl would repent and return.
Oh, it's beyond anything!
"Don't they know that you are here?"
The kick he had received was a foretaste of what he might expect, and after a little consideration he came to the conclusion that his duty was to escape, and get back to the cutter as quickly as he could.
An awkwardly shaped high backed chair with elbows and cushions.
How dare you break into our house.
"You shall not tell.
Archy was silent.
"Don't-don't cry out; I did not come to frighten you."
Suddenly the sobbing ceased, and the girl said slowly,--
"Ah!" came again out of the darkness, in a low wailing tone.
The interjection came as if it were the outcome of sudden passion. There was a quick, rustling sound, and before the boy could realise what was to come, the door was closed, the lock shot into its socket, and he heard the grinding sound of bolts, top and bottom.
Archy was silent.
Fireplace-chimney!
"I am from the cutter lying off the coast.
"Well!" he exclaimed; "and I felt sorry for her as one might for one's sister at home, and hung back from getting her people into trouble.
Perhaps there was another way out, and to prove that he went softly round to feel the oak panelling which covered the walls, to come upon a door directly.
Rather hard measure, by the way, to deal out to the anxious girl, who could not rest while Shackle's gang were busy about the place, and had come stealthily down to open the little corner room window, and watch from time to time until they had gone.
I've got my duty to do, and I'll do it.
"No," he thought to himself, "I don't believe they would kill me, but they would knock me about."
"I must."
"You insolent-"
The answer came like a flash.
"Not you.
"Oh, those bars!" he mentally exclaimed, and he was advancing toward them, when just as he drew near, there was a rustling noise under the window, a couple of hands seized the bars, there was a scratching of boot toes against stone work, and Ram's face appeared to gaze into the room by intention, but into the astonished countenance of the young midshipman instead.
"no Stop here till Sir Risdon comes down, and tell him I'm very sorry; that we should have cleared out last night, only a born fool saw Jerry Nandy's lobster boat coming into the cove, and came running to say it was a party from the cutter."
"He has gone to give the alarm," thought the prisoner, and he looked excitedly round for a way of escape.
See you for nothing, middy.
"no I'm going to keep you here till the gentlefolks get up, and then I'll bring 'em round to see the monkey in his cage, just like they do in the shows, when you pay a penny.
"Look here, sir!" said Archy, losing his temper.
It was just before sunrise too, for there were flecks of orange high up in the sky.
What did they say?--false alarm-tell Sir Risdon they would clear all away to night-see if anything had been left about-lobster boat!
I've been shut in all night."
Be ready!"
The door was too strong to attack, and he remembered the three fastenings.
It was a very faint hope, and one he felt not likely to be realised, and he returned once more to the window, with the intention of resuming his task, when he heard the bushes pressed aside by some one coming, and directly after the bars were seized as before.
No: he was not dreaming, for he was looking out on the sea, over which a faint mist hung like wreaths of smoke.
"Oh!" said Ram looking puzzled.
What did it mean?
But how queer for Mr Gurr to be talking like that to Andrew Teal, the boy who helped the cook!
"Here, quick!
"Why, I could tie you up in a knot, and heave you off the cliff any day.
Once out of that room he could ran, and by daylight the smugglers dare not hunt him down.
"Now a handkerchief," said the gruff voice.
"You're mistaken," said Archy gruffly, as he made a feeble struggle to keep up the character he had assumed.
Don't look a bit like a fisher lad, and never will."
And why did Andy call Mr Gurr father?"
"Anything I can," cried Archy eagerly.
"You rope's end me!" he said.
"Because I want my liberty."
"Not you," said the boy jeeringly.
The result was not very satisfactory, but sufficiently so to make him essay the bar of the window once more, producing a grating, ear assailing sound, as he found that now he did make a little impression,--so little though, that the probability was, if he kept on working well for twenty four hours, he would not get through.
Who locked you in?"
Ha!
I was wondering why that window was open."
"Tell him not to be uneasy; 'tis all right, and I'll have everything clear away to night."
"Ha! Ha!
To his astonishment the boy did not flinch, but thrust his own arms through, placing them about the middy's waist, clenching his hands behind, and uttering a sharp whistle.
"What a queer dream!" he thought to himself.
What a game!
He had been fast asleep, and those words had awakened him.
Ram showed his white teeth, as he burst out with a long, low fit of laughter.
"Guinea?" said the boy.
"Nothing left nowhere?
"Yes, father, quite."
Be quick, there's a good fellow.
He jumped up from the chair feeling horribly stiff, and looked steadily round for a way to escape before it was too late.
Nothing but the chimney presented itself.
"A fisher boy."
"Yes, father.
The dull sound of departing steps, and a low whistling sound coming down through the skylight window into the cabin where Archy Raystoke lay with his heavy eyelids pressed down by sleep.
"What'll yer give me?"
I want to get away at once."
The midshipman gave his head a jerk, but the effort was vain, for the hand over his eyes gave place to a broad handkerchief, which was tightly tied behind, and then a fierce voice whispered in his ear,--
Archy stepped back to the door listening, but there was not a sound.
Come round and open the door."
"But what did Mr Gurr mean about going home to breakfast?
"It would be a pity.
"Never mind about that; let me out of this place."
"No; I can't part with that."
Why, your clothes don't fit you, and your cap's put on all skew rew.
Labour in vain.
"What for?" cried Ram.
"Sure you've looked round everywhere, boy?"
"Not you.
Come round and open the door.
Ram sprang up, found a resting place for his toes, and looked in, grinning at him.
Go back aboard, and put on your uniform.
He gave himself a twist, and was about to turn out of his sleeping place, and then opened his eyes widely, and stared about him, too much overcome still by his heavy sleep to quite comprehend why it was that he was in a gloomy, oak panelled, poorly furnished room, staring at an iron barred open window.
Just like a big monkey in a show."
Sure none of the lads chucked anything aside the path when they ran up?"
I looked well both sides."
"It was your turn yesterday, it's mine to day.
What a game!
He must be awake.
"No; I've degraded myself enough," he said angrily, "and there are sure to be bars across.
It was you father kicked for shirking, and-My!-- well: I hardly knowed you."
"Will you come round and open the door?" said Archy in an angry whisper.
I say, do you know what you look like?"
"I know you.
"Yes, father."
I say, where's your sword?
"Once more; will you come and let me out?"
It was a trap, and the midshipman understood it now.
Here, what made you dress up like that?"
And be stuck there, and dragged out like a rabbit by the hind legs from his hole!
But at the end of five minutes he stopped, and thrust back the dirk into its sheath.
CHAPTER THIRTEEN.
"But I'll-yes, I'll give you a guinea, if you will let me out."
"No; it couldn't be a dream.
Go round and open the door.
You laughed and fleered at me when I was on the cutter's deck.
Like a monkey."
I was shut in last night by mistake."
"Think I don't know you, Mr Orficer? Where's your fine clothes and your sword?
And I'm hungry too. Time I was up, I suppose."
"Nonsense!
"Oh, of course," replied the boy grinning; and he dropped down, rushed through the bushes, and disappeared from view.
"Gentlemen don't fight with low, common fellows like you, but if you do not come round and let me out, next time we meet I'll have a bit of rope's end ready for you."
"Fold it wide.
"Shall I come too, father?"
"I'm going home to breakfast."
Turning sharply, he looked about the room; then, after glancing ruefully at the bright little weapon, halfway up the blade of a rich deep blue, in which was figured a pattern in gold, he yielded to necessity, and began to chop at the top bar of the grate, so as to nick the edges of his weapon and make it saw like.
Only a sham.
"Yes.
"I told you, a fisher boy!" cried Archy impatiently, but trying not to offend his visitor, who possessed the power of conferring freedom, by speaking sharply.
Looks comf'table enough as you are.
Look like a wild beast in a cage.
"Keep still, or you'll get your weasand slit.
"Won't do," said Ram quickly.
Ha!
There was an interval of thinking over this knotty question, during which the low whistling went on.
Why don't you draw it, and come out and fight? I'll fight you with a stick."
"No," said Sir Risdon.
"One of your ship boys?" he said.
Lady Graeme looked ghastly.
Gurr glanced round to see if the men were looking, and then said rather huskily but kindly,--
"That's enough, sir; but may I ask you, if you do see or hear anything of such a lad, you will send a messenger off to the cutter?"
"Well, seen anything suspicious?"
"Surely!" cried Sir Risdon excitedly.
"What?"
But I am justly punished, and never again will I allow myself to be made an accessory to these lawless deeds."
Gurr turned angrily away, and to find himself facing Dick.
"Eh?"
"I said a lad 'bout seventeen, in a red cap like yours," said Gurr very shortly.
Mr Raystoke, sir?
"Ah!" ejaculated Dick sadly.
Mrs Shackle shook her head.
"No, no,--you must be mistaken. A boyish prank.
I do assure you there's nothing here but what you may see."
"Runned away."
"I loathe the whole business, but when I saw my wife and child suffering almost from want of the very necessaries of life, and the temptation came in the shape of presents from that man, I could not resist-I was too weak.
You, sir," he said, going towards where Jemmy stood grinning.
"Scratch them then."
"A lad, looking like a common sailor, and wearing a red cap."
"However, sir, I'm not on that sort of business now," continued Gurr sternly.
"I dunno," muttered Dick, "and a man can't be sure.
"Here, my lad, where's your master?"
Now, my lads, forward!"
"Nonsense!
Gurr saluted, and stated his business, while the baronet, who had turned sallower and more careworn than his lot drew a breath full of relief.
Came ashore yesterday, lad of seventeen in a red cap."
"Never mind the rabbits, lads," cried Gurr angrily; "we want to find Mr Raystoke."
"I mean to have a turn at that chap, Master Gurr, sir.
Hi!
There was nowhere else to search as far as Gurr could see, save the little farm in the hollow, and the black looking stone house up on the hill among the trees.
The men marched off, and Sir Risdon stood watching them.
"You're only a common sailor, Dick, and I'm your officer, but though I speak sharp unto you, I respect you, Dick, for you like that lad."
Don't be a fool."
Now, my lads."
"I suppose there is a good deal of smuggling on the coast," said Sir Risdon coldly, as he thought of his vault.
Dick sighed, and then all at once he spat in his fist, rubbed his hands together and clenched them, a hard, fierce aspect coming into his rough dark face, which seemed to promise severe retaliation if anything had happened to the young officer.
"Don't blame me," he said sadly.
"What!
"You have seen no one?" he continued, turning to Lady Graeme.
"I say, where's your master?"
"no
I feel as if I had him for 'bout quarter hour I could knock something out of him."
"One of our boys is missing.
"I have seen no one answering to the description here."
Sir Risdon dared not trust himself to speak, but darted an agonised glance at his wife.
"If you'd let me finish, you'd know," said Gurr gruffly.
"No, sir," replied Dick humbly, and the men tramped on with a couple of open mouthed, barefooted boys following them to stare at their cutlasses and pistols.
"I do not know."
No one about here would injure a boy."
"Oh, sir," interrupted Mrs Shackle, "surely you are not going to tumble over my house again!
"Oh!" said Jemmy with a vacant look.
"I'll let some of you see about that, my fine fellows."
"Look here, my lad, one of our boys is missing.
Seen him up here?
"Have he runned away?"
Boy 'bout seventeen with a red cap."
"Yes sir, there is, and it will go hard with the people who are caught having any dealings with the smugglers."
"Certainly," said Sir Risdon.
"Chucked him off yonder."
You won't see him again."
"No, sir."
"It is hardly right to enlist me in the search for one of your deserters," said Sir Risdon coldly.
"Beg pardon, sir, but can you, as a gentleman, assure me that he is not here?"
"Thank ye!--No, Dick," continued the master, turning back to where the men were waiting, and unconsciously brushing against the bush behind which the middy had hidden himself, "that woman knows nothing.
But he always came out again to his men with an anxious look in his eyes, and generally ranged up alongside of Dick.
"You do not know?"
The only way in which I could allow myself to act was to keep myself in complete ignorance of the going and coming of these people.
If she knew evil had come to the poor lad, her face would tell tales like print.
He led his men on, stopping at each cluster of cottages and shabby little farm to ask suspiciously, as if he felt certain the person he questioned was hiding the truth.
Jemmy Dadd's countenance changed from its vacant aspect to one full of cunning, as the party from the cutter moved off, but it became dull and semi idiotic again, for Gurr turned sharply round.
Come ashore yesterday."
"Morning, marm," said Gurr; "sorry to trouble you, but-"
"In ord'nary, Dick, my lad, no; but when smugglers finds themselves up in corners where they can't get away, they turns and fights like rats, and when they fights they bites."
"Want to find that boy.
The man shook his head, and stared as if he didn't half understand the drift of what was said.
"Don't know as he has been seen about here, do you?" said Gurr, looking at her searchingly.
"Won't I?" muttered Gurr between his teeth.
Good day.
"What for?
Beginning to feel scarred about him."
"So shall we yet, sir.
"Yes sir, that's it," said Dick eagerly.
"Beg pardon, sir.
"That's right.
"Yes, sir."
"Yes, sir."
"Yes, sir."
"Start at once, sir?"
Oysters?"
Dirty Dick screwed up his mouth as if to speak, but only stared.
Of course, well armed?"
"Now, Mr Gurr," he said, "I'm only going to say one thing to you in the way of instructions."
"Mr Gurr," said the little lieutenant, raising himself up on his toes, so as to be as high as possible, "will you have the goodness to talk sense?"
"Mr Gurr!"
"Yes, sir," said the man humbly.
Very ill advised thing to do.
"Seemed in good spirits last night, Mr Gurr, eh?"
Seems to me like going eel fishing with your bare hand."
"Beg pardon, sir; didn't mean any harm."
What did you suppose I thought they were?
"Very true, sir."
Do you think I should say a thing that was false?"
There aren't a public house for ten miles."
"Very unlucky, sir.
Now, then, why do you want to go ashore?"
"Don't turn yourself into a figurehead of an old wreck sir.
"Dear me!
A great pity.
At last the little lieutenant could bear the anxiety no longer.
"Do you hear me, sir?" cried the lieutenant.
I'm getting very anxious about Mr Raystoke."
"Certainly, sir."
You must go and find him.
Dear me!" said the little lieutenant after a few more turns up and down.
"Smugglers are smugglers, indeed.
He's a Tartar; that's what he is.
"no Wait.
"Yes, sir; of course."
"Shall I go at once sir?"
Soon as the signal comes, we shall push off.
"Well, sir," said the master, hesitating, "smugglers are smugglers."
"Didn't mean that."
"I say, sir, I have only one order to give you.
Speak out, and don't do the double shuffle all over my clean deck."
"Yes, you did, sir.
"Then I must request that you will not make it again.
These fellows are very cunning, but we shall be too many for them one of these days."
Oh yes."
"Beg pardon, sir," said the master deprecatingly.
"Yes.
"Beg pardon, sir.
"Yes.
"Well, you're going soon as the skipper orders."
"No, wait another half hour.
Keep a sharp look out on the cliff to see if Mr Raystoke is making signals for a boat.
Hang the boy!
"Scared about whom?"
He swung round, walked aft and began sweeping the shore again with his glass, while the master and Dick exchanged glances which meant a great deal.
"Worse.
"No, sir."
"Now, my good fellow, what do you mean by that?"
You meant that you were getting uneasy about Mr Raystoke's prolonged absence."
"Yes, sir; but he may turn up on the cliff at any moment."
"It was only an observation, sir."
"Steady!
"Yes, sir; you did tell me.
"Leave to go ashore, sir."
"I mean all alone by myself, sir."
"I mean liked his job?"
I ought not to have listened to you; but in my anxiety to leave no stone unturned to capture some of these scoundrels, I was ready to do anything."
Don't see me getting out o' temper with everybody, and spitting and swearing like a mad Tom cat.
Men quite ready?"
Time we had some news of him, eh?"
I daresay he has been there all the time, only you took up my attention with your chatter."
What do you want?"
You might catch one by accident."
By this time the little lieutenant was scanning the cliffs again, and the master took off his hat and wiped his forehead.
Then said the prior of the convent: What should this drunken fellow do here?
Whereupon the body of the army marched forward towards a pass or ford called the Gue de Vede, except seven companies of foot and two hundred lancers, who, staying there, broke down the walls of the close, to waste, spoil, and make havoc of all the vines and vintage within that place.
So great was the cry of the wounded, that the prior of the abbey with all his monks came forth, who, when they saw these poor wretches so slain amongst the vines, and wounded to death, confessed some of them.
Believe, that it was the most horrible spectacle that ever one saw.
Nevertheless, at all adventures they rang the bells ad capitulum capitulantes.
The town being thus pillaged, they went unto the abbey with a horrible noise and tumult, but they found it shut and made fast against them.
Wherefore is it, that our devotions were instituted to be short in the time of harvest and vintage, and long in the advent, and all the winter?
Nay, said the monk, the wine service, let us behave ourselves so that it be not troubled; for you yourself, my lord prior, love to drink of the best, and so doth every honest man.
But when those that had been shriven would have gone out at the gap of the said breach, the sturdy monk quashed and felled them down with blows, saying, These men have had confession and are penitent souls; they have got their absolution and gained the pardons; they go into paradise as straight as a sickle, or as the way is to Faye (like Crooked Lane at Eastcheap).
Whence comes this to pass, my masters?
Lord God! da mihi potum.
If any offered to hide himself amongst the thickest of the vines, he laid him squat as a flounder, bruised the ridge of his back, and dashed his reins like a dog.
let him be carried to prison for troubling the divine service.
To others through their ballocks he pierced their bumgut, and left not bowel, tripe, nor entrail in their body that had not felt the impetuosity, fierceness, and fury of his violence.
To which he answered that they should cut the throats of those he had thrown down upon the ground.
Others shouted as loud as they could Confession, Confession, Confiteor, Miserere, In manus!
By the virtue of God, why do not you sing, Panniers, farewell, vintage is done?
How a monk of Seville saved the close of the abbey from being ransacked by the enemy.
He had not only extended his empire in the west from Cappadocia to the river of Egypt, crippled Urartu and pacified his eastern frontier, but brought Assyria into close union with Babylonia, the mother land, the home of culture and the land of the ancient gods.
The remnant of the Philistines shall perish.
Israel was also dealt with.
He swept through Israel "like a hurricane".
The national exchequer had been exhausted by the loss of tribute from revolting provinces, trade was paralysed, and the industries were in a languishing condition.
If he failed in his attack on Urartu, his prestige would vanish at home and abroad and Sharduris might, after establishing himself in northern Syria, invade Assyria and compel its allegiance.
I will break also the bar of Damascus ... and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir....
He proclaimed himself "King of Sumer and Akkad" and "King of the Four Quarters".
Supported by Assyria, the kings of Israel had become powerful and haughty.
Samaria closed its gates against him although their king had been dispatched to Assyria.
Tiglath pileser combined in equal measure those qualities of generalship and statesmanship which were necessary for the reorganization of the Assyrian state and the revival of its military prestige.
Tiglath pileser next operated against the Median and other hill tribes in the north-east.
Two years later Kullani and Hamath fell, and the districts which they controlled were included in the Assyrian empire and governed by Crown officials.
Shalmaneser died before Samaria was captured, and may have been assassinated.
But Amaziah would not hear.
Babylon next claimed the attention of Tiglath pileser.
And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to their tents.
Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be faint hearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.
The Dynasty of Jehu had come to an end by this time.
Little is known regarding his brief reign.
The circumstances which made this expedition necessary are of special interest on account of its Biblical associations.
Six months afterwards he was assassinated by Shallum.
A contemptuous answer was returned.
In the following year Tiglath pileser returned to Syria.
Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.
Thus saith the Lord....
It is significant to note in this connection that the new king was an unswerving adherent of the cult of Ashur, by the adherents of which he was probably strongly supported.
Two years afterwards Tiglath pileser returned, captured Shapia, and restored peace throughout Babylonia.
He was welcomed in Babylon, which opened its gates to him, and he had himself proclaimed king of Sumer and Akkad. The Chaldaeans paid tribute.
The Philistines and the Arabians of the desert were also subdued.
Their most prominent leader was the prophet amos, whose eloquent exhortations were couched in no uncertain terms.
Tiglath pileser had to content himself by devastating the city on the plain and the neighbouring villages.
Tiglath pileser led his army across the Euphrates and reached Arpad without meeting with any resistance.
Tiglath pileser did not overrun Chaldaea, but he destroyed its capital, Sarrabanu, and impaled King Nabu ushabshi.
Apparently Hoshea, king of Israel, pretended when the Assyrians entered his country that he remained friendly.
He was met with a stubborn resistance.
This usurper held sway at Samaria for only a month.
At the beginning of his reign there was much social discontent and suffering.
Pekah sought to extinguish the orthodox party's movement by subduing Judah.
At this time the reputation of Tiglath pileser hung in the balance.
Trouble was brewing in Syria.
Tiglath pileser had now reached the height of his ambition.
The frontier states of Elam and Media were visited and subdued.
The walls of Jerusalem were repaired by Jotham, father of Ahaz, and a tunnel constructed to supply it with water.
Judah had taken advantage of the disturbed conditions in Israel to assert its independence.
He appears to have been a popular leader of the revolt against Ashur nirari, who, like certain of his predecessors, had pronounced pro Babylonian tendencies.
Once again the hebrews came into contact with Assyria.
In the spring of seven forty three b c
In seven forty b c
Nabonassar had died and was succeeded by his son Nabu nadin zeri, who, after reigning for two years, was slain in a rebellion.
Plundering bands of Aramaeans were menacing the western frontiers and had overrun part of northern Babylonia.
For three years he conducted vigorous campaigns in "the western land", where he met with vigorous resistance.
For thus saith the Lord unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me and ye shall live....
Shalmaneser, however, was well informed, and made Hoshea a prisoner.
isaiah visited Ahaz and said,
Pekah had to deal with a powerful party in Israel which favoured the re establishment of David's kingdom in Palestine.
The latter appeared to him to be the most feasible and judicious procedure, for if he succeeded in expelling the invaders he would at the same time compel the allegiance of the rebellious Hittite states.
Its foreign garrison was slaughtered.
Tiglath pileser recorded that Rezin took refuge in his city like "a mouse".
About seven seventy three b c he appears to have co operated with Assyria and conquered Damascus and Hamath.
His son Zachariah, the last king of the Jehu Dynasty of Israel, came to the throne in seven forty b c towards the close of the reign of Azariah, son of Amaziah, king of Judah.
I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which will devour the palaces of Ben hadad.
His return in Sargon's reign was evidently connected with the new rising in which he took part.
He was the Assyrian monarch who deported the "Lost Ten Tribes".
So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath pileser king of Assyria, saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up and save me out of the hand of Syria and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me.
This man was evidently an orthodox Hebrew, for he taught them "how they should fear the Lord....
He condemned Israel for its idolatries, and cried:
Natura abhorret vacuum.
I have a remedy against thirst, quite contrary to that which is good against the biting of a mad dog.
There I catch you, I awake you.
My 'prenticeship is out, I am a free man at this trade.
My tongue peels.
O the drinkers, those that are a dry, O poor thirsty souls!
I'faith, pure Greek, Greek!
Long clysters of drinking are to be voided without doors.
The great God made the planets, and we make the platters neat.
But this shall banish it utterly.
Appetite comes with eating, says Angeston, but the thirst goes away with drinking.
Hey now, lads, let us moisten ourselves, it will be time to dry hereafter.
I have the word of the gospel in my mouth, Sitio.
Come, therefore, blades, to this divine liquor and celestial juice, swill it over heartily, and spare not!
This is after the fashion of Switzerland.
Like a cardinal!
Are Christians more temperate, nearer virtuous, nearer honest than savages?
They are regarded as immoral.
It has never made man moral, temperate, industrious and honest.
Are the failures under obligation to their creator?
You cannot reform these people with tracts and talk.
Can infinite wisdom and power make any excuse for the creation of failures?
The fourth stone is that that which cannot be destroyed could not have been created; that the indestructible is the uncreatable.
The second stone is that force cannot be destroyed, cannot be annihilated.
Can we cure disease by supplication?
Passion is, and always has been, deaf.
At the same time they do not want children, because a child is a curse, a curse to them and to itself.
It follows that nothing has been or can be created; that there never has been or can be a creator.
We have all the links of the chain, twenty six links inclusive from moner to man.
They have been traced.
During all these years and by all these peoples it was believed that this God heard and answered prayer, that he forgave sins and saved the souls of true believers.
The gutter is a nursery.
Did infinite goodness create the countless worthless living things that breed within and feed upon the flesh of higher forms?
In this incident we see the real spirit of Protestant lovers of the Bible.
Now, the questions are, Whether religion was founded on any known fact?
We must not build on guesses, fancies, analogies or inferences.
They depend on the Lord, on luck and charity.
What has been the effect of Christianity in Italy, in Spain, in Portugal, in Ireland?
Fear bends the knees and utters the prayer.
It follows that there could not have been any intelligence, any design back of matter and force.
Afterward it was supposed that he was satisfied with the blood of oxen, lambs and doves, and that in exchange for or on account of these sacrifices, this God gave rain, sunshine and harvest.
Consequently there could not by any possibility have been any intelligence, any force, back of matter.
Can we add to our knowledge by ceremony?
It therefore follows that the supernatural does not and cannot exist.
Religion teaches the slave virtues-obedience, humility, self denial, forgiveness, non resistance.
They will fill homes with light and joy.
Reform.
Religion is helpless.
They will be clasped with glad hands to happy breasts.
We did not get our information from inspired books.
Would the lynchers be more ferocious if they worshiped gods of wood and stone?
It has no will, no purpose.
Could they have been worse had they had any other religion than Christianity?
This cannot be done by talk or example.
You cannot reform these people with preach and creed.
In the universe there is no chance, no caprice.
The greatest of human beings has said, "Conscience is born of love."
We know the footsteps of advance.
According to the theologians, God did not make all men alike.
He takes the left hand, believing it to be the right road, and travels until he finds that it is the wrong one.
They muffled all the bells of gladness.
On the door of life they hung the crape of death.
We now know, if we know anything, that the universe is natural, and that men and women have been naturally produced.
So thousands have endeavored to establish the existence of God by the fact that we have what is called the moral sense; that is to say, a conscience.
If we build, we must begin at the bottom.
Lips, religious and fearful, tremblingly repeat this passage: "Though he slay me, yet will I trust him." This is the abyss of degradation.
Could these countries have been worse without religion?
This cannot be done by force, physical or moral.
What is this power?
Has it made men nobler, more merciful, nearer honest?
What did Christianity do for them?
Among savages do we not find that their vices and cruelties are the fruits of their superstitions?
I have a theory and I have four corner stones.
Think of the Niagara of blood pouring over the precipice of cruelty!
He retraces his steps and takes the right hand road and reaches the place desired.
What was the effect of Christianity in Switzerland, in Holland, in Scotland, in England, in America?
Why did he create the intellectually inferior?
Can we conceive of a devil base enough to prefer his enemies to his friends?
Remember the Inquisition.
Can we hasten or delay the tides by worship?
Why?
Can we receive virtue or honor as alms?
He caused the sun to rise, to steal all moisture from the land, but gave no rain.
Man is a social being.
The master cannot be great enough to make slavery sweet.
Science, the only possible savior of mankind, must put it in the power of woman to decide for herself whether she will or will not become a mother.
Has man obtained any help from heaven?
Has Christianity done good?
Did infinite wisdom intentionally produce the microscopic beasts that feed upon the optic nerve?
We have fossil facts and living forms.
In other words, it was just as fiendish, just as infamous as the Catholic spirit.
If they give up one God, they imagine another.
Failure seems to be the trademark of Nature.
It is fear.
Would Torquemada have been worse had he been a follower of Zoroaster? Would Calvin have been more bloodthirsty if he had believed in the religion of the South Sea Islanders?
The withered hands of want will not be stretched for alms.
That which has not happened, could not.
Because they have more passion than intelligence, more passion than conscience, more passion than reason.
The babes that are then born will be welcome.
Men and women who think that light is the enemy of virtue, that purity dwells in darkness, that it is dangerous for human beings to know themselves and the facts in Nature that affect their well being, will be horrified at the thought of making intelligence the master of passion.
MOST people cling to the supernatural.
Why, then, should we say that God is good?
Having outgrown Jehovah, they talk about the power that works for righteousness.
Being infinite, he is conditionless; being conditionless, he cannot be benefited or injured.
Think of blinding a man to satisfy the appetite of a microbe!
Ignorance, poverty and vice are populating the world.
I will tell them why.
The third stone is that matter and force cannot exist apart-no matter without force-no force without matter.
The last phase of this belief in sacrifice was, according to the Christian doctrine, that God accepted the blood of his son, and that after his son had been murdered, he, God, was satisfied, and wanted no more blood.
Intelligence is the only lever capable of raising mankind.
In other words, it proves that man has never received any help from heaven; that all sacrifices have been in vain, and that all prayers have died unanswered in the heedless air.
The form and motion of every star, the climate of every world, all forms of vegetable and animal life, all instinct, intelligence and conscience, all assertions and denials, all vices and virtues, all thoughts and dreams, all hopes and fears, are necessities.
As people advance, the remote consequences are perceived. The standard of conduct becomes higher.
Can we affect the nature and qualities of substance by prayer?
The next time he goes to the same place, he does not take the left hand road.
We know the paths that life has traveled.
They tried to do away with infancy and youth, with prattle of babes and the song of the morning.
Not one of the countless things and relations in the universe could have been different.
They hated pleasure.
Religion does not teach self reliance, independence, manliness, courage, self defence.
A man wishing to go to a certain place comes to where the road divides.
They are blamed, despised, punished.
The religion of the Puritan was an unadulterated curse.
Think of the victims!
FOR thousands of years men and women have been trying to reform the world.
The imagination is cultivated. A man puts himself in the place of another.
Taking the ground that it was not produced here, was not produced by man, they then imagine a God from whom it came.
Why should men and women have children that they cannot take care of, children that are burdens and curses?
They made cradles by putting rockers on coffins.
This is the solution of the whole question.
Would the Puritan have been worse if he had adopted the religion of the North American Indians?
Religion has never made man merciful.
Man has a little intelligence, and he should use it.
Let us be honest.
Take our own dear, merciful Puritan Fathers?
RELIGION has been tried, and in all countries, in all times, has failed.
Would john Knox have been any worse had he deserted Christ and become a follower of Confucius?
This, in a general way, is the definition of religion.
Can the world be civilized to that degree that consequences will be taken into consideration by all?
This cannot be done by moral suasion.
If a good and infinitely powerful God governs this world, how can we account for cyclones, earthquakes, pestilence and famine?
To accomplish this there is but one way.
Has the Bible made the people of Georgia kind and merciful?
Ignorance, poverty and vice must stop populating the world.
In the Puritan year there were twelve Decembers.
Man advances, and necessarily advances through experience.
The tide of vice is rising.
There is no intelligence without force.
Science must make woman the owner, the mistress of herself.
Can we say that in the heart of this God there blossomed the flower of pity?
Is not what we call mind just as natural as what we call body?
Is he responsible for all the wars that have been waged, for all the innocent blood that has been shed?
Man has deceived himself.
IF we have a theory, we must have facts for the foundation.
We now know our ancestors, our pedigree.
We live together in families, tribes and nations.
We have the family tree.
Can we change winds by sacrifice? Will kneelings give us wealth?
Is he responsible for the centuries of slavery, for the backs that have been scarred with the lash, for the babes that have been sold from the breasts of mothers, for the families that have been separated and destroyed?
Nature has no design, no intelligence.
Man judges himself.
When God made these different races he knew that the superior would enslave the inferior, knew that the inferior would be conquered, and finally destroyed.
When that time comes the prison walls will fall, the dungeons will be flooded with light, and the shadow of the scaffold will cease to curse the earth.
Why?
These unwelcome children fill the jails and prisons, the asylums and hospitals, and they crowd the scaffolds.
To those who believe in the Uniformity of Nature, religion is impossible.
Nature produces without purpose, sustains without intention and destroys without thought.
He saw the seeds that man had planted wither and perish, but he sent no rain.
Of course, it is admitted by Christians that all other religions are false, and consequently we need examine only our own.
Was there goodness, was there wisdom in this?
If there were no famine, no pestilence, no cyclone, no earthquake, would we think that God is not good?
Must the world forever remain the victim of ignorant passion?
Did he allow his enemies to torture and burn his friends?
I do not pretend to know.
Among savages, the immediate consequences of actions are taken into consideration.
The members who add to the misery of the family, the tribe or the nation, are considered bad members.
Religion has never made man free.
When the church had control, were men made better and happier?
Why did he create the deformed and helpless?
The first stone is that matter-substance-cannot be destroyed, cannot be annihilated.
The family, the tribe, the nation, creates a standard of conduct, of morality.
Religion rests on the idea that Nature has a master and that this master will listen to prayer; that this master punishes and rewards; that he loves praise and flattery and hates the brave and free.
If we say yes, then I ask another question: Should the inferior races thank God that they are not superior, or should they thank God that they are not beasts?
They are praised, admired and respected.
It is insisted by these theologians, and by many of the so-called philosophers, that this moral sense, this sense of duty, of obligation, was imported, and that conscience is an exotic.
They are regarded as good; that is to say, as moral.
Religion makes God a master and man his serf.
Whether any sacrifice of babe or ox secured the favor of this unseen God?
It is a result.
Do we prove his goodness by showing that he has opened the earth and swallowed thousands of his helpless children, or that with the volcanoes he has overwhelmed them with rivers of fire? Can we infer the goodness of God from the facts we know?
It was also believed that if the sacrifices were not made, this God sent pestilence, famine, flood and earthquake.
THE POWER THAT WORKS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS.
Can we say that he cared for the children of men?
The prisons, jails, poorhouses and asylums are crowded.
The sense of obligation, of duty, was naturally produced.
The babe is not welcome, because it is a burden.
The members of a family, of a tribe, of a nation, who increase the happiness of the family, of the tribe or of the nation, are considered good members.
Whether such a being as God exists?
We must have corner stones.
Why did he create the criminal, the idiotic, the insane?
Whether any prayer was ever answered?
In view of these facts, what, after all, is religion?
I say what I think.
The structure must have a basement.
Men and women who believe that slaves are purer, truer, than the free, who believe that fear is a safer guide than knowledge, that only those are really good who obey the commands of others, and that ignorance is the soil in which the perfect, perfumed flower of virtue grows, will with protesting hands hide their shocked faces.
Did infinite goodness fashion the wings of the eagles so that their fleeing prey could be overtaken?
There is nothing supernatural in this.
The last link has been found.
Is he responsible for all the chiefs, kings, emperors, and queens?
RELIGION can never reform mankind because religion is slavery.
They will be dust.
Fear pretends to love.
They are not intelligent enough to think about consequences or to feel responsibility.
Poverty and crime will be childless.
Think of the egotism of a man who believes that an infinite being wants his praise!
Did infinite goodness create the beasts of prey with the intention that they should devour the weak and helpless?
Criminals, tramps, beggars and failures are increasing every day.
Suppose that an infinite God exists, what can we do for him?
He saw the people look with sad eyes upon the barren earth, and he sent no rain.
The hand is burned, and after that the child keeps its hand out of the fire.
Whether he was the creator of yourself and myself?
They live by fraud and violence, and bequeath their vices to their children.
If these calamities did not happen, would we suspect that God cared nothing for human beings?
We now know that our first parents were not foreigners.
The present is the necessary product of all the past, the necessary cause of all the future.
How can we account for cancers, for microbes, for diphtheria and the thousand diseases that prey on infancy?
He has tried that road, and knows that it is the wrong road.
He cannot want.
WHAT has our religion done?
The sense of duty becomes stronger, more imperative.
These weapons of reform are substantially useless.
Ah, where have gone all my goodness and all my shame and all my belief in the good!
Beware lest in the end a narrow faith capture thee, a hard, rigorous delusion!
With thee have I wandered about in the remotest, coldest worlds, like a phantom that voluntarily haunteth winter roofs and snows.
A haven towards which MY sail is set?
"What!" said he, "have not the most ludicrous things always happened to us old anchorites and saints?
The devil himself is perhaps-skin.
What?
What still remaineth to me?
My shadow calleth me?
'Nothing is true, all is permitted': so said I to myself.
Thus spake the shadow, and Zarathustra's countenance lengthened at his words.
Must I ever be on the way?
Ah, how oft did I stand there naked on that account, like a red crab!
Alas, how wilt thou forego and forget that loss?
It is also skin.
Thou hast lost thy goal.
What matter about my shadow!
For we ought to learn from them one thing: ruminating.
--His great affliction: that, however, is at present called DISGUST.
Behold, thither leadeth the way to my cave: be to night its guest.
"But they received me not," said the voluntary beggar, "thou knowest it, forsooth.
He would not be rid of his affliction,
"Who is this with whom I talk?" he exclaimed frightened, and sprang up from the ground.
--Who was ashamed of his riches and of the rich, and fled to the poorest to bestow upon them his abundance and his heart?
And verily, although a man should gain the whole world, and yet not learn one thing, ruminating, what would it profit him!
But they received him not."
Except we be converted and become as kine, we shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.
Thou also!
--At the culprits of riches, with cold eyes and rank thoughts, who pick up profit out of all kinds of rubbish-at this rabble that stinketh to heaven,
After a little while they met a camel.
Let the Tiger eat the man, for men are the persecutors of the earth."
Is it fair that he should do so or not?"
So the Brahman and the Tiger walked on till they came to a Banyan tree; and the Brahman said to it: "Banyan Tree, Banyan Tree, hear and give judgment." "On what must I give judgment?" asked the Banyan Tree.
But the Alligator said: "Whenever I put my nose out of the water men torment me and try to kill me.
"How do you mean?" said the Jackal; "how were you within the cage? which way were you looking?" "Why, I stood so," said the Tiger, jumping into the cage, "and my head was on this side." "Very good," said the Jackal, "but I cannot judge without understanding the whole matter exactly.
"Exactly there, was it?" asked the Jackal.
Let the Tiger eat the man, for men are an ungrateful race."
At a little distance they found a bullock lying by the roadside.
Was the cage door open or shut?" "Shut and bolted," said the Brahman.
The Brahman gave himself up as lost; but again he prayed the Tiger to have patience and let him ask the opinion of the sixth judge.
The Bullock said: "When I was able to work my master fed me well and tended me carefully, but now I am old he has forgotten all I did for him, and left me by the roadside to die.
Let the Tiger eat the man, for men have no pity."
The Brahman stated the case, and the Eagle answered: "Whenever men see me they try to shoot me; they climb the rocks and steal away my little ones.
They soon elbowed him abruptly.
"That will be enough."
"In the meanwhile I will live on my clothes and my watch."
His aunt did not inform his grandfather of this refusal for fear of exasperating him.
In the meantime Aunt Gillenormand, a rather good hearted person at bottom in difficulties, had finally hunted up Marius' abode.
"That is good."
"Monsieur Courfeyrac answered for you."
"I know a watchmaker who will buy your watch."
Besides, had he not said: "Let me never hear the name of that blood drinker again!"
He declared to himself that he would not doubt, and he began to doubt in spite of himself.
What will you do after that?"
"Yes."
In the troubled state of his conscience, he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence.
"That is good."
"I do not know."
Whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was, he could not halt there, he was irresistibly constrained to continue, to advance, to examine, to think, to march further.
"Do you want me to lend you some?"
The half lights of doubt pained him.
"Silver?"
The clothes dealer was sent for.
"Do you know English?"
"Never."
He paid twenty francs for the cast off garments.
His discomfort was augmented by all the reflections which occurred to him.
"Have you clothes?"
"And in the meanwhile?"
What opulence!"
"I do not know in the least," replied Marius.
The landlord presented his bill, which had to be paid on the spot.
At that moment, he had three francs left.
Whither would this lead him?
It is badly paid work, but one can live by it."
He feared, after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father, to now take a step which should estrange him from that father.
"And my boots."
He bought the watch for forty five francs.
Marius was gloomy.
An escarpment rose around him.
"Because one of my friends, a publisher, is getting up a sort of an encyclopaedia, for which you might have translated English or German articles.
"Gold; here it is."
"And the hotel bill?" observed Courfeyrac.
Courfeyrac having made his appearance, the host left them.
"I have ten francs left," said Marius.
"So much the worse."
He affirmed to himself that he would not.
They went to the watchmaker's.
"Request Courfeyrac to come and talk with me," said Marius.
"Have you any money?"
Marius was clear eyed, and he required the true light.
"Why?"
"Have you trinkets?"
"But I must have my money."
"What is to become of you?" said Courfeyrac.
"What are you going to do?"
"No; it is not good.
"You will then have only a pair of trousers, a waistcoat, a hat and a coat."
"Whatever is necessary.
He ceased to go to the Cafe Musain.
"Here is what I have."
"A watch."
"That is not bad," said Marius to Courfeyrac, on their return to the hotel, "with my fifteen francs, that makes eighty."
"Do you know German?"
Anything honest, that is to say."
To stand between two religions, from one of which you have not as yet emerged, and another into which you have not yet entered, is intolerable; and twilight is pleasing only to bat like souls.
That will be swallowing a tongue very fast, or a hundred sous very slowly."
"Fifteen francs."
At last he raised the net to let the beast go free.
The peasant was there, and the shepherd, and the lords and beggars and high born dames, all those whom Ethelried had ever befriended.
While he stood looking around him in bewilderment, a Firefly alighted on his arm.
The art of rhyming had been neglected in his early education, and it was not until the first cock crowing began that he succeeded in making this one:
He could hear Frog eye Fearsome snoring like a tempest up in the watch tower, and the old Witch was talking in her sleep in seven languages.
They were brave men, and they would not have feared to meet the fiercest wild beasts, but many shrunk back when the Ogre came rushing out.
So the Ogre was killed, and the Prince came into his kingdom that was his heart's desire.
Then he sank on his knees in astonishment.
Bang!
"Giant scissors, serve me well, And save me from the Witch's spell!"
"He found my lamb," cried another.
But the King laughed him to scorn.
Now just at that moment it happened that the Court Tailor came into the room to measure the King for a new mantle of ermine.
Still the beautiful Princess languished in her prison.
At this moment there was a distant rumbling as of thunder.
"See him," laughed one of the brothers that was dark to one that was fair.
They would not acknowledge their fear.
Once across that, they would be out of his power, but it seemed impossible to cross.
Farewell."
By the time he reached the edge of the forest he was very tired, and ready to faint from hunger.
Day by day the scissors grew sharper and sharper and ever more quick to spring forward at his bidding.
Forthwith the grinning Jester began shrieking with laughter, so that the bells upon his motley cap were all set a jangling.
When he had cut it loose and carried it home, the shepherd also became his firm friend, and would have gone through fire and water to serve him.
"What is to become of me?" cried the poor peasant.
They were so rusty from long idleness that he could scarcely move them.
"My grain must fall and rot in the field from overripeness because I have not the strength to rise and harvest it; then indeed must we all starve."
While he stood gazing at the struggling beast, it turned to him with such a beseeching look in its wild eyes, that he was moved to pity.
So he set to work with the little scissors to cut the great ropes of the net in twain.
So Ethelried left the palace, and wandered away over mountain and moor with a heavy heart.
"Giant scissors, rise in power! Grant me my heart's desire this hour!"
The Prince spent all the following time until midnight, trying to think of a suitable verse to say to the scissors.
He dashed across the drawbridge, and, opening his scissors, cried:
But the next morning no one came to take him to the gallows, and he sat all day in total darkness.
But know that the scissors move only when bidden in rhyme.
The grandame whom he supplied with fagots, the merchant whom he rescued from robbers, the King's councillor to whom he gave aid, all became his friends.
Again the scissors grew longer and longer, until they lay across the chasm like a shining bridge.
"We must hasten." Seizing the scissors that lay on the ground where Ethelried had dropped them, she opened and shut them several times, exclaiming:
"Giant scissors, bridge the path, And save us from the Ogre's wrath."
Better dead than this craven life to which my father hath doomed me!"
It was the Fly, which had alighted on his shoulder.
The scissors hung useless and rusting by his side.
"I did but laugh to think the sword of Ethelried had been so quickly found," responded the Jester, and he pointed to the scissors hanging from the Tailor's girdle.
The whole field was cut by sunrise.
"Until that far day, now get thee gone!"
Presently, as he worked, the blades began to grow sharper and sharper, and brighter and brighter, and longer and longer.
And so they went on, each telling of some unselfish service that the Prince had rendered him.
Flashing its little lantern in the Prince's face, it cried, "This way!
Great beads of sweat stood out on his brow as he bent himself to the task.
My friend, the Fly, sent me to guide you to a place of safety.
They did not know his name, they did not know that he was Prince Ethelried, but they knew by his valor that there was royal blood in his veins.
"Well, you shall never steal again, that I promise you.
Your prison door is of iron, but the shutter which bars the window is only of wood.
Soon he came to a tiny hut where a sick man lay moaning, while his wife and children wept beside him.
"He comes afoot; no prancing steed, no waving plumes, no trusty sword; little and lorn, he is not fit to be called a brother to princes."
Throwing himself on his knees before the King, he cried, "Oh, royal Sire, bestow upon me also a sword and a steed, that I may up and away to follow my brethren."
By the light of the moon he saw that a ferocious wild beast had been caught in a hunter's snare, and was struggling to free itself from the heavy net.
One by one their brave heads were cut off and stuck on poles along the moat that surrounded the castle.
Follow me and trust entirely to my guidance."
It was he who changed me into the form of a wild beast, and set the snare to capture me.
Keep all but the Princess."
In a very short time the Prince had crawled through the opening.
"Scissors, grow a giant's height And save us from the Ogre's might!"
To him who could bring her back to her father's castle should be given the throne and kingdom, as well as the Princess herself.
"'tis the Ogre!" cried the Fairy.
But Ethelried heeded not their taunts.
Before he could thank her she had vanished, and he was left in the forest alone.
Every cap was thrown up, and such cheering rent the air as has never been heard since.
Ethelried hurried across after the Fairy, trembling and dizzy, for the Ogre was now almost upon them.
"Nay," he said.
I shall make my escape thereat and go to repay thy unselfish service to me.
As soon as they were safe on the other side, the Fairy blew upon the scissors, and, presto, they became shorter and shorter until they were only the length of an ordinary sword.
His first thought was to slay the animal, for he had had no meat for many days.
Just then he spied a tree, hanging full of great, yellow apples.
"Thou a sword!" he quoth.
No one knew that he was a prince; no fireside offered him welcome; no lips gave him a friendly greeting.
The sight was so terrible, that he turned on his heel, and fled away as fast as his feet could carry him.
But remember that thou canst not keep them sharp and shining, unless they are used at least once each day in some unselfish service."
The Fairy darted down the path thus opened up, and Ethelried followed as fast as he could, for the horrible roaring was rapidly coming nearer.
However, he toiled on all night, slowly cutting down the grain stalk by stalk.
Again the Fairy touched the scissors, saying:
He was thrust into the dungeon and left there all day.
He had spent his last coin and knew not where to go for another.
Towards morning the scissors became brighter and sharper, until they finally began to open and shut of their own accord.
"What now, Fool?" demanded the King.
"He saved my harvest," cried one.
One day a herald dashed down the highway, shouting through his silver trumpet that a beautiful Princess had been carried away by the Ogre.
One night as he lay in a deep forest, too unhappy to sleep, he heard a noise near at hand in the bushes.
But escape is possible.
By this time a great many people, attracted by the terrific noise, had come running up to the moat.
When the poor Prince saw his brothers riding out into the world to win their fortunes, he fain would have followed.
They said, "We are only waiting to lay some wily plan to capture the Ogre."
After several days Ethelried reached the place on foot.
There he stood, outside the dungeon, but it was a dark night and he knew not which way to turn.
The Prince flung his mantle over his shoulder, and followed on with all possible speed.
At last they reached a wide chasm that bounded the Ogre's domain.
Among those who drew back were Ethelried's brothers (the three that were dark and the three that were fair).
It was dull work.
Wylder was surprised, puzzled, and a good deal incensed-that saucy craft had fired her shot so unexpectedly across his bows.
Mark's ideas of ladies and of propriety were low, and he was little better than a sailor ashore, and not a good specimen of that class of monster.
CHAPTER four.
'What thing?
He assisted at it, but took no part, and in fact was listening to that other conversation which sounded, with its pleasant gabble and laughter, like a little musical tinkle of bells in the distance.
IN WHICH WE GO TO THE DRAWING ROOM AND THE PARTY BREAKS UP.
He would have liked, at that moment, a walk upon the quarter deck, with a good head wind blowing, and liberty to curse and swear a bit over the bulwark.
After a while, in a pet, he walked away.
So Mark waited to put the lady into the carriage, and he meditated walking a little way by the window and making his peace, and there was perhaps some vague vision of jumping in afterwards; I know not.
He would have talked to ugly mrs w Wylder, his sister in law, at his left, but she was entertaining Lord Chelford now.
His gall rose, and that distant talk rang in his ears like a cool but intangible insult.
my dear Miss Lake,' said that good little woman, skipping to her side.
'The story of "Fridolin," and Retzch's pretty outlines.
Wylder was rather surly after the ladies had floated away from the scene, and he drank his liquor doggedly.
Mark clapped on his hat, and rifled the pocket of his paletot of his cigar case and matches, and spluttered a curse or two, according to old Nollekins' receipt for easing the mind, and on the door steps lighted his cheroot, and became gradually more philosophical.
Sit down beside me, and I'll tell you the story.'
Women are so full of caprice and hypocrisy, and 'humbugging impudence!'
It was his fancy, I suppose, to revive certain sentimental relations which had, it may be, once existed between him and Miss Lake; and he was a person of that combative temperament that magnifies an object in proportion as its pursuit is thwarted.
Then he joined a conversation going on between Dorcas Brandon and the vicar, his brother.
Once more then I tell you that I feel quite able to execute this statue three times better than the model, as I have before engaged my word.
I felt compelled to complain pretty sharply to his Excellency; and having gone to wait on him one morning in the Via de  Servi, I spoke as follows:   My lord, I do not now receive the monies necessary for my task, which makes me fear that your Excellency has lost confidence in me.
I had to pay the workmen out of my own pocket; for the Duke, after giving Lattanzio Gorini orders to discharge their wages, at the end of about eighteen months, grew tired, and withdrew this subsidy.
Now grant me my permission, prince!
As I thought that this was due to some fault in the earth, I wanted to make these first experiments before I undertook my Perseus.
Perceiving at once how base the business would be, I exclaimed:   Fear not, vile coward!
I frequently replied that everybody, nay, all Italy, knew well I was an excellent goldsmith; but Italy had not yet seen what I could do in sculpture. Among artists, certain enraged sculptors laughed at me, and called me the new sculptor.
It is true that he lent me a pair of old scales, two anvils, and three little hammers, which articles I begged his workman, Giorgio da Cortona, fifteen days ago, to fetch back.
The first cast I took in my furnace succeeded in the superlative degree, and was so clean that my friends thought I should not need to retouch it.
One thinks that you will never get it done.  In a rage I up and answered:   May the plague catch you and all who dare to think I shall not finish it!
Domenico Poggini and Gianpagolo his brother, who are present, will confirm my words; for I spoke to them at once about it, and since that time have never once alluded to the matter, because your Excellency told me I did not understand these things, which made me think you wanted to keep up the credit of your stone.
Thereupon I recovered command of my faculties, and thanked God that His goodness had withheld me from so great an act of violence.
I was of course aware that the admirable sculptor Donatello had cast his bronzes with the clay of Florence; yet it seemed to me that he had met with enormous difficulties in their execution.
Taking the road toward Florence, just when I entered the piazza of San Domenico, Bandinello was arriving from the other side.
Then I made my suit to her and prayed her tell the Duke that I was getting small assistance for so great a work; I begged her also to warn him not to lend so ready an ear to Bandinello  s evil tongue, which hindered me from finishing my Perseus.
I shall not try to rob you of eight or ten thousand ducats at one go, but shall rather seek to earn them by my industry.
On taking leave, he would not let me go, but held me with his little hands and a tempest of cries and tears.
The Duke, hearing something of these disputes, sent for the vase and the models, and never told me why or wherefore. Suffice it to say, that he placed some of my designs in the hands of divers persons at Venice and elsewhere, and was very ill served by them.
I moved heaven and earth to get back the body of the vase, which he had begun badly, as I have already said, together with the remainder of the silver.
But, as I suppose your Excellency is joking, I will add no more.  He replied that, far from joking, he meant solemn earnest.
I have mentioned one.  I said:   My lord, I thank you, and beg you to condescend so far as to listen to four words.
chap.
I BELIEVE have already narrated how Domenico and Giovanpagolo Poggini, goldsmiths and brothers, were at work in the Duke  s wardrobe upon some little golden vases, after my design, chased with figures in bas relief, and other ornaments of great distinction.
I do not condescend to smite you.  He looked at me submissively and said nothing.
I asked Lattanzio why he did not pay me as usual.
When I took them to her Excellency, she received me most graciously, and repaid the gold and silver I had spent upon them.
THE FIRST piece I cast in bronze was that great bust, the portrait of his Excellency, which I had modelled in the goldsmith  s workroom while suffering from those pains in my back.
To prove the truth of these words, I need only remind your Excellency of Donatello and the great Lionardo da Vinci in the past, and of our incomparable Michel Angelo Buonarroti in the present; they augment the glory of your Excellency by their genius. I in my turn feel the same desire and hope to play my part like them; therefore, my lord, give me the leave to go.
When I reached the house, I found the boy in good health, and kissed him, very sad at heart.
There!
I should like you to know, my lord, that I do understand, and that, as regards my character, I consider myself no less honest than any man who ever lived upon this earth.
She then desired me to fasten it upon her breast, and handed me a large pin, with which I fixed it, and took my leave in her good favour.
You had better put this to the proof, and I will go at once to the Bargello.  The Duke made answer:   Benvenuto, do your best to be an honest man, as you have done until now; you have no cause for apprehension.  So the whole matter passed off in smoke, and I heard not one more word about it.
No sooner did he catch sight of me than he turned the colour of a corpse, and trembled from head to foot.
He kept indeed enticing me to push this job forward by daytime also; but I would not consent, although I felt sure I should incur his anger.
One day on one of these occasions, I mounted a nice nag I had, put a hundred crowns in my purse, and went to Fiesole to visit a natural son of mine there, who was at nurse with my gossip, the wife of one of my workpeople.
I can no sooner give you some little hints whereabouts they live, but you know them presently, and I meant you should be beholding to me for your acquaintance.
You had strange luck to meet my brother so soon.
I lent it most willingly, and gone he is.
You have been there, I am sure.
I never deserved a long letter so much as now, when you sent me a short one.
she's cruel, and how far her power may reach I know not, only I am sure, she cannot call back time that is past, and it is long since we resolved to be for ever
Forgive me that this is no longer, for
If anything could be wonder'd at in this age, I should very much how you came by your informations.
You will think him altered (and, if it be possible) more melancholy than he was.
I am your.
My father has lost his too, and my eldest brother, but we all look like people risen from the dead.
But, besides, I can give you others.
Well, 'twas a pretty lecture, and I grew warm with it after a while; in short, we came so near an absolute falling out, that 'twas time to give over, and we said so much then that we have hardly spoken a word together since.
I think my youngest brother comes down with him.
All that is to be hoped is, that since he may reduce whomsoever he pleases to his obedience, he will be very curious in his choice, and then I am secure.
Do you know him?
But it seems this gentleman is not so easy access, but you may acknowledge something due to me, if I incline him to look graciously upon you, and therefore there is not much harm done.
I knew you could not choose but like her; but yet, let me tell you, you have seen but the worst of her.
But I am hugely pleased that you have seen my Lady.
If marriage agrees no better with other people than it does with him, I shall pray that all my friends may 'scape it.
Yet if I were my cousin, h Danvers, my Lady Diana should not, if I could help it, as well as I love her: I would try if ten thousand pound a year with a husband that doted on her, as I should do, could not keep her from being unhappy.
I have no company now but my niece Peyton, and my brother will be shortly for the term, but will make no long stay in town.
In earnest, we have had such a skirmish, and upon so foolish an occasion, as I cannot tell which is strangest.
I'll swear her friends are much to blame to let her go abroad.
He went up but last Tuesday.
I have no room for more than
It may be I dreamt it that you had met my brother, or else it was one of the reveries of my ague; if so, I hope I shall fall into no more of them.
But, I thank God, an imagination took him one morning that he was falling into a dropsy, and made him in such haste to go back to Cambridge to his doctor, that he never remembers anything he has to ask of me, but the coach to carry him away.
Only my cousin Molle keeps his still; and, in earnest, I am not certain whether he would lose it or not, for it gives him a lawful occasion of being nice and cautious about himself, to which he in his own humour is so much inclined that 'twere not easy for him to forbear it.
'tis more than I know if mr Freeman be my servant.
My best qualities (if I have any that are good) served but for aggravations of my fault, and I was allowed to have wit and understanding and discretion in other things, that it might appear I had none in this.
But that's in nobody's power, and my Lady Talmash, that says she can do whatsoever she will, cannot believe whatsoever she pleases.
Is it true?
I wonder how she behaved herself when she was married.
Because you find fault with my other letters, this is like to be shorter than they; I did not intend it so though, I can assure you.
I cannot talk on't at the rate that you do.
How long this letter will be I cannot tell.
I make it a case of conscience to discover my faults to you as fast as I know them, that you may consider what you have to do.
I know not how he may be prejudiced as to the business, but he is not deaf to reason when 'tis civilly delivered, and is as easily gained with compliance and good usage as anybody I know, but by no other way.
However, 'tis not amiss that my will made you know now how to dispose of all my wealth whensoever I die.
[Directed.] For your master.
We go abroad all day and play all night, and say our prayers when we have time.
You shall have all the time that is allowed me, but upon condition that you shall not examine the sense on't too strictly, for you must know I want sleep extremely.
'tis a miracle to me how my brother endures it.
He is so amongst his children too, though he loves them passionately.
How welcome you will be. But, alas!
He has certainly as great a kindness for her as can be, and, to say truth, not without reason; but all the people that ever I saw, I do not like his carriage towards her.
All this is perfect nonsense in their opinion; but I should not doubt the convincing them if I could hope to be so happy as to be
Would it would leave me, and then I could believe I shall not always have occasion for it.
You have no such ladies in Ireland?
Yours.
My aunt told me no longer agone than yesterday that I was the most wilful woman that ever she knew, and had an obstinacy of spirit nothing could overcome.
Well, in sober earnest now, I would not live thus a twelvemonth to gain all that the King has lost, unless it were to give it him again.
He is perpetually wrangling and finding fault, and to a person that did not know him would appear the worst husband and the most imperious in the world.
If I drown by the way, this will be my last letter; and, like a will, I bequeath all my kindness to you in it, with a charge never to bestow it all upon another mistress, lest my ghost rise again and haunt you.
The sun was up an hour before I went to bed to day, and this is not the first time I have done this since I came hither.
My humour is so ill at present, that I dare say no more lest you chide me again.
I do not find it, though I am told I was so extremely when I believed you loved me.
That I would not find, and you have only power to make me think it.
My poor Lady Vavasour is carried to the Tower, and her great belly could not excuse her, because she was acquainted by somebody that there was a plot against the Protector, and did not discover it.
Take heed! you see I give you fair warning.
But I am called upon.
Indeed, I like him extremely, and he is commended to me, by people that know him very well and are able to judge, for a most excellent servant, and faithful as possible.
I told them I knew no remedy but leaving me behind next time, and could have told them that my looks were suitable to my fortune, though not to a feast.
I am beginning it to day; and have chosen to go as far as Gravesend by water, though it be very gloomy weather.
He came down into the country where she was upon a visit, and one morning married her.
Do not take it ill, for I would endure it if I could, rather than fail; but in earnest I do not think it were possible for me.
I told you in my last that my Suffolk journey was laid aside, and that into Kent hastened.
The less one knows of State affairs I find it is the better.
My next shall make amends for this short one.
I am got into my complaining humour that tires myself as well as everybody else, and which (as you observe) helps not at all.
Pray let me know whether your man leaves you, and how you stand inclined to him I offer you.
Here are some verses of Cowley's.
'tis the pleasantest thing that can be to hear us discourse.
Tell me how you like them.
The captain coming in shortly after the sudden flight of the gamblers, took charge of the money, and the next day restored it to the owners.
"Yes I do.
"I tell you this is growing serious," whispered one in a shaking voice, his very lips white with fear.
"I think not very."
And how wonderfully he has answered our petitions.
That fellow Nick Ward, is a noted blackleg and ruffian: had his nose broken in a fight and is sensitive on the subject; was cheating of course."
"'Is it strange, then that smokers and chewers have a thousand ailments? that German physicians attribute one half of the deaths among the young men of that country to tobacco?
Permission was given and the next moment the two stood close together each gazing admiringly into the other's face.
I'll have no fighting aboard."
Then Frank's papa came for him, saying the air was growing very cool, and it was time to go in.
Hence a resort to cider and beer.
They bent eagerly over the board, each watching with feverish anxiety his companion's movements, each casting, now and again, a gloating eye upon the heap of gold and greenbacks that lay between them, and at times half stretching out his hand to clutch it.
"And I," remarked Travilla, "abandoned its use about the same time that Dinsmore did, and for the same reasons.
Frank looked inquiringly at his father.
"'And then such powerful acids produce intense irritation and thirst-thirst which water does not quench.
But surely those were rare cases?"
"Let me go!" yelled Ward, making a desperate effort to free his arms.
Cousin Ronald took Frank on his knee and asked, "What are you going to do, my little fellow, when you get to be a man."
"Yes indeed," she said, bending down to kiss Frank and stroke his hair.
Yet there was gambling again the second night, between Ward and several others of his profession.
"I wonder which of us it is!" remarked the first, looking hard at our party.
"'The half dozen cigars which most smokers use a day, contain six or seven grains-enough, if concentrated and absorbed, to kill three men, and a pound of tobacco, according to its quality, contains from one quarter to one and a quarter ounces.
"How dare you, sir?
To Elsie's observant eyes it presently became evident that the Dalys were in very straitened circumstances.
There was a pause broken by young Horace, who had been watching a group of men gathered about a table at the further end of the room.
some effort must be made!" and he started up as if with the intention of approaching the players.
This time the voice seemed to come from a stateroom behind the gambler. Towering with rage, he rushed to the door and tried to open it.
"Ah ha! um h'm! ah ha!
Our friends were of the same opinion and all repaired to the ladies' saloon, where, through the children, they and the Dalys soon made acquaintance.
"Yes, you may go if you wish," returned the latter, and the two started off hand in hand.
Failing in that, he demanded admittance in loud angry tones, at the same time shaking the door violently, and kicking against it with a force that seemed likely to break in the panels.
mr Daly was a minister going South for the winter for the sake of his own and his wife's health.
"There are some nice looking people on board," remarked mr Travilla, in an undertone, to his wife.
She consulted with her husband, and the result was a warm invitation to the Dalys to spend the winter at Viamede, where they would have all the benefit of the mild climate, congenial society, use of the library, horses, etc, and be at no expense.
that's strongly put," remarked mr Lilburn, reflectively.
"Thank you, no; I don't smoke."
"Rather comical, I think, my man.
"It came from under the table," gasped Ward, "look what's there."
"Where's that Dutch villain?" Ward was screaming, following up his question with a volley of oaths.
It was the last game of cards for that trip.
"His name is Fank," said Harold.
They heard him in silence, with a cool, phlegmatic indifference most exasperating to one in his present mood.
mr Daly smiled.
They kept it up till after midnight.
Then mr Lilburn, waking from his first sleep, in a stateroom near by, thought he would break it up once more.
By the way, I met with a very strong article on the subject, lately, which I cut out and placed in my pocket book."
"'One of the direct effects of tobacco is to weaken the heart.
"I'm afraid I'll have to give it up.
There was nothing there.
"Mamma, see!
Suppose you and he shake hands, Frank."
"Look yourself."
The words had scarcely passed his lips when a voice spoke apparently close at the villain's side.
isn't he a dear little boy?" asked Harold, leading his new friend up before her with an air of proud ownership.
The more this thirst is fed, the more insatiate it becomes, and more fiery drink is needed.
"I don't know, but come on.
who are you?" cried the rascal, starting up white with rage and turning to face his accuser.
"Ah ha! um h'm!
"I have never used the weed in any way," said Horace junior
"Yes, sir," said the child, holding out a small, plump hand, "What's your name, little boy?"
"Ah ha! um h'm! suppose you give us the benefit of it," suggested Lilburn good naturally, "I'm open to conviction."
"Who was it?
"Do you, son?" was the smiling rejoinder.
"Doubtless that is the case," remarked mr Dinsmore.
"Beside ourselves," added Cousin Ronald, laughing.
"Let's follow and see the fun."
"What does it mean?" cried one.
"He certainly looks like a very nice little boy.
The ladies were weary, and retired to their state rooms shortly after tea, but the gentlemen sought the open air again and paced the deck for some time.
"I never knew before," said he, "that my boy intended to follow my profession."
A deep groan startled them and they sprang to their feet, pale and trembling with sudden terror, each holding his breath and straining his ear to catch a repetition of the dread sound.
"Oh, nonsense! what fools we are! of course somebody's ill in one of the state rooms." And they resumed their game for the second time.
The eyes of the whole party were at once turned in that direction.
"Stay a moment," exclaimed Lilburn in an undertone, and laying a detaining hand upon Travilla's arm, but with his gaze intently fixed upon the older gamester.
"No sir: they don't laugh when papa says it."
Don't you like this nice big boat?"
"Have a cigar, sir?" asked mr Lilburn, addressing mr Daly.
"Yes," she answered; "that little group yonder: a young minister and his wife and child, I suppose.
"Yes, Frank Daly.
I saw him slip a card from his coat sleeve."
"Yes, mamma," chimed in the last named young gentleman, "he's a nice little boy.
The articles of impeachment against Strafford are twenty eight in number; and regard his conduct, as president of the council of York, as deputy or lieutenant of Ireland, and as counsellor or commander in England.
Strafford was obliged to speak with deference and reserve towards his most inveterate enemies, the commons, the Scottish nation, and the Irish parliament.
The question before the council was, "Offensive or defensive war with the Scots." The king proposes this difficulty, "But how can I undertake offensive war, if I have no more money?"
The answer ascribed to Strafford was in these words: "Borrow of the city a hundred thousand pounds: go on vigorously to levy ship money.
"Where has this species of guilt lain so long concealed?" said Strafford in conclusion.
The accusation and defence lasted eighteen days.
In the government of Ireland, his administration had been equally promotive of his master's interest, and that of the subjects committed to his care.
Your majesty having tried the affections of your people, you are absolved and loose from all rules of government, and may do what power will admit.
"And now, my lords, I thank God, I have been by his blessing sufficiently instructed in the extreme vanity of all temporary enjoyments, compared to the importance of our eternal duration.
Some instances of imperious expressions, and even actions, may be met with.
But discretionary authority during that age was usually exercised even in England.
Your majesty, having tried all ways, shall be acquitted before God and man.
"Impose not, my lords, difficulties insurmountable upon ministers of state, nor disable them from serving with cheerfulness their king and country.
In Ireland, it was still more requisite, among a rude people, not yet thoroughly subdued, averse to the religion and manners of their conquerors, ready on all occasions to relapse into rebellion and disorder.
The case of Lord Mountnorris, of all those which were collected with so much industry, is the most flagrant and the least excusable.
"Let us not, to our own destruction, awake those sleeping lions, by rattling up a company of old records which have lain for so many ages by the wall, forgotten and neglected.
No imputation of rapacity could justly lie against his administration.
"But you have only just come; you can easily manage, and in any case, even if you fail----"
What can she be doing out by herself?
Just after midnight she rose with a sigh to prepare for bed.
Don't talk any more.
Leslie opened it and followed her.
"Drink that?" she said.
Oh! now I remember; she got a letter which upset her very much and went out.
But Leslie was a healthy girl; she had been well trained, she had plenty of self possession, and an abundance of strong common sense.
FRESHERS.
I must pass in honors; if I don't I shall die."
Don't say a word.
"Can't you manage with a candle, just for once?"
Dear, dear! where can she be?"
"Don't begin!
I find these modern languages so very stiff."
Yes, I must find her without delay."
Annie did not hear it. Leslie opened the door.
"Now, drink this at once," she said in a voice of authority, "if you really wish to sleep."
"There is nothing for it but for me to go and look for her," she said to herself.
Annie did not smile.
I want to sleep.
A few moments later there came a tap at the door.
In order to avoid such a catastrophe, she divided her hours carefully, allowing a certain amount for recreation and a certain amount also for the guiding of her wayward companion, to whom, as the days went on, she became really attached.
Her face grew suddenly white as death.
She had no idea of allowing herself to break down.
Jane Heriot stood without.
"I am so glad that you have got one at last----"
She crushed the letter up tight, thrust it into her pocket, and said abruptly, "What is the hour?"
There was no doubt that she had got a shock; but of what nature Leslie could not in the least make out. There was no help for it, however.
"I shall go-I know a way.
"These letters have just come for you and Annie Colchester," she said: "and, as I was coming upstairs, I thought I would leave them with you."
"Dear me, Annie!" she said, "I was quite frightened about you."
I shall go off to sleep-that is all I care for."
Leslie did not venture to say any more.
She looked round the room.
"Have you had bad news?" said Leslie.
As she intended to aim at a first, or, at least, second class, her range of study was very wide; and German, French, and Italian literature had to be more or less understood in order to give her a thorough and complete grip of her subject.
She ventured to call Annie's name softly; there was no reply.
Leslie seated herself with her back to her companion and opened her own letters.
Annie's manner was very mysterious.
"It can never mean the same to you," she said at last in a solemn voice, and then she looked down again at her book, pushed her hands through her red locks, and resumed her contemplation of the problem which lay before her.
"I do not mean to fail any more than you do," replied Leslie.
"Why, you will be parting from me, you know.
They joined the tennis, racquets, and boating clubs; Eileen and Marjorie, having submitted to the necessary test, were made full blown members of the latter club immediately.
"What are you studying now?" asked Annie.
I only want to get into bed and to sleep."
"But," she added abruptly, "you speak of something which must not take place.
I must go into the grounds; the air is stifling."
Leslie had to take a few swimming lessons before she could do so.
She lit the little spirit lamp, put on the milk to boil, and prepared the cocoa as usual.
I won't be the constant worry and plague of your life.
"Well, read it in peace," said Leslie.
In any case, you are quite certain to wish for another room, and to get it also next term.
After a time she looked round.
What do you mean?"
Leslie thanked her and eagerly grasped the little parcel.
Her queer red brown eyes with their distended pupils gazed straight before her.
If I do remain, therefore, I shall be plagued with some terrible student of the Florrie Smart or Jane Heriot style.
I am truly glad it has come."
Her eyes shone with pleasure at the anticipation of the delightful time she would have reveling in the home news; the other letter was directed to Annie Colchester.
She turned off the light, and lit a candle, which she put behind her screen, then prepared to get into bed.
She got into bed as she spoke, and wrapped the clothes tightly round her.
Annie's eyes were very bright, her cheeks were no longer pale, and there was a brilliant color in them. She did not take the least notice of Leslie; but, going into the room, shut the door.
I'll be back presently."
There was no sign of Annie Colchester.
She shut the window.
Poor girl, she spoke of it as cold water to the thirsty; she looked when I saw her last as if it had half killed her.
"The course is enormous, and I am sometimes almost in despair."
I am sleepy; I shall sleep."
"I am not going to confide in you; so don't think it.
I am going to get into bed, and to remain perfectly quiet, and you are not to ask me one question about anything.
"I mean that I don't want you to begin to ask questions.
"Don't begin," said Annie.
"It has come," she cried: "at last I have news."
"Oh, do turn off the electric light," she said again.
"But your letter, dear?"
"I have to take German literature from fifteen hundred to the death of Goethe," said Leslie.
Leslie stood and thought about her for a moment or two; but then her own correspondence absorbed her, and she did not notice when eleven and even twelve struck.
I walked up and down as fast as ever I could outside in order to make myself sleepy.
"I have been starving, or, rather, I have been thirsting.
"Do you want to kill me?
"What do you mean?" replied Leslie.
"You are ill," said Leslie.
"I took it out," said Leslie.
You know on occasions you are absent minded, and one half of this room is mine when all's said and done.
"Refuses to come?" she cried.
"Oh, my dear," said Jane, "if you begin to fret about the oddities of the college you will never know a moment's peace.
She refuses to come."
"Please don't call me that," said Leslie, tears now visiting her pretty eyes.
She turned back, ran down the corridor, and knocked at Annie's door.
After the address the girls themselves were encouraged to speak, and a very animated discussion followed.
"I will talk with you, Belle Acheson, presently," she said.
All her words were uttered with great eloquence and much feeling.
"I don't want," she added, "to get into any set: but I do wish to be kind to Belle, for I think she has good points in her.
But Marjorie and Eileen had already departed, and Leslie and Jane found themselves among the last students to arrive at the great East Hall.
She was a musician of rare power, and Leslie listened with her heart in her eyes.
"How dare you interfere?" she said, her eyes flashing.
"She does not know what she is saying.
"Oh, I shall never do that," replied Leslie.
Excuses make no difference.
She has committed a very grave act of disobedience.
"I don't think she is quite well," replied Leslie.
They say too that you are exceedingly clever, and yet you have no jealousies and no smallnesses in you.
Jane stooped, and applied her eye to the keyhole, but she could see nothing within.
Please find it before you go."
It was past ten o'clock when she left the hall.
Miss Lauderdale said a great deal more.
Miss Lauderdale will be very angry with anyone who does not attend."
"Oh, I won't lock you out," she said; "but I must have the key.
Marjorie and Eileen were close to her.
Jane came up.
Leslie walked to her own side of the room.
"'Am I my brother's keeper?' you ask," she continued.
And why, may I ask?
Let me in."
Finally the principal sat down amid loud cheering.
"Don't say any more," cried Jane.
In despair she came back and joined Leslie.
Have the goodness to find it and put it back."
Jane Heriot's voice was heard in the passage.
"But there, you are one of the 'unco good,' I am afraid."
"She seems to have turned both deaf and dumb, and I can do nothing with her," she answered.
"I'll wait for you here," said Leslie.
Most of the girls were enthusiastic over the new scheme; and Marjorie and Eileen in particular felt their hearts glowing and their eyes sparkling.
"I know you don't quite mean what you say," said Leslie; "but of course if you really wish me----"
I am longing for you to leave the room.
"What is it, Leslie?" she said; "you look as if something was worrying you."
Yes; you annoy me more than words can tell."
"If you two are ready," she called out, "we may as well start."
I pay for it, and I have a right to it."
I want to be alone-go!"
For all who sin, all who suffer, you are to a certain extent responsible.
"What can this mean?" she said to herself.
"You are to go, and say nothing about me.
"The physical part of your training, and also the mental part, are abundantly supplied in this great house of learning," she continued; "but the spiritual part, it seems to me, ought now to be strengthened.
She works too hard, and she---- But there, I don't know that I ought to say any more."
"Something is," replied Leslie, "but I don't know that I ought to tell tales out of school."
Still there was no response.
"You fret me beyond endurance.
Here they were supplied with light refreshments, and presently Miss Lauderdale herself went to the organ at the end of the room, and played some splendid music.
"Took it out!
"I believe poor Annie is dreadfully unhappy."
One by one the many students filed in and took their places.
You are responsible for him, and some day you will be asked what you have done with your responsibility. If you leave the world without having fulfilled that terrible and yet grand obligation, you will through all eternity feel the loss of what you might have gained."
"God answers to each of you, 'You are.' The world says, 'No, I am not,' but God says, 'Yes, you are.' All men are your brothers.
I will then more fully declare my plans, and show the girls who wish to join our league a programme which I hope they will approve of."
There was no reply.
Miss Lauderdale, after a pause, during which her kind eyes were fixed on Belle's excited face, spoke:
Then a roll call was gone through by one of the tutors; the only absentee was Annie Colchester.
Do-do let me."
The girl who breaks the rules has to be punished.
Do let me go and tell Miss Frere.
"But now, Leslie, what is the trouble?
that is, if you care to confide in me."
I am sure she is ill.
When it was over, folding doors were thrown back, and all the students were invited into the large saloon which Miss Lauderdale reserved for very rare and special occasions.
"I see by your face, Miss Gilroy, that you are distressed about something.
"Some day, Jane, you must see her.
"Hear, hear! and once again, hear!" suddenly said the sharp voice of Belle Acheson.
Oh, Annie, I know you are dreadfully unhappy about something, and I wish I could comfort you.
Jane stood still and faced Leslie.
"I shall be only too delighted," cried Jane.
She uttered her strange remark standing up.
"Coming in a moment, Jane," answered Leslie.
Miss Lauderdale stepped forward, and began to address the students.
Say nothing about me, please.
Since you came I feel myself tied and bound.
"I am afraid I am," replied Leslie, distress now in her tone.
"I am Jane Heriot; I want to speak to you at once.
"I ought not to leave you.
"It is just possible that she may have gone down the back stairs, and be already in the hall."
You will get into a most awful scrape if you don't.
"I must see her myself early in the morning, and I am quite sure that nothing will satisfy Miss Lauderdale except a very ample apology and a full explanation of the reason why she absented herself.
I felt her hand too, and it was very hot.
Do come, Annie; don't be such a goose.
You see, all the girls except Eileen and Marjorie laugh at her, and that seems to me to make her worse."
"I'll go back and speak to her.
Jane rattled the handle impatiently.
You are a universal favorite; I envy you your popularity."
It is my duty to save her from getting into hopeless disgrace."
That night she was marvellously beautiful.
It is curious, one must admit.
"I will have them taken off."
"Good evening," she said as I entered, holding out her hand.
But to be really loved by a courtesan: that is a victory of infinitely greater difficulty.
With them the body has worn out the soul, the senses have burned up the heart, dissipation has blunted the feelings.
Now, go; I can't keep my eyes open."
As I saw him, a cold shiver went through my heart.
"Well, keep it; but it only depends on me to make it useless to you, after all."
They love by profession, and not by instinct.
At seven o'clock I was at the Vaudeville.
"How?"
I shall say nothing."
How? why?
"Yes; but if I should already ask for something?"
To be loved by a pure young girl, to be the first to reveal to her the strange mystery of love, is indeed a great happiness, but it is the simplest thing in the world.
How could I disobey?
The duke comes every morning; they will tell him, when he comes, that I am asleep, and perhaps he will wait until I wake."
Do you understand?"
People blame those who let themselves be ruined by actresses and kept women; what astonishes me is that twenty times greater follies are not committed for them.
I know; and you are wrong, so let us say no more about it.
"There are bolts on the door."
But to return to the first day of my liaison.
"I was wrong; forgive me."
Doubtless Marguerite perceived the impression made on me by the presence of this man, for she smiled to me again, and, turning her back to the count, appeared to be very attentive to the play.
Weeks, months, years pass, and all at once, when they have each followed their fate along a different path, the logic of chance brings them face to face.
After all, the presence of m de g in Marguerite's box was the most natural thing in the world.
Hence those great devotions, those austere retreats from the world, of which some of them have given an example.
When I reached home I was in a state of mad gaiety.
"Yes, my children," said she; "have no fear.
I returned to my seat.
"What?"
"Let me have that key."
"All day long."
The boxes filled one after another.
Chapter twelve
Only one remained empty, the stage box.
"Unfortunately, he got it for me without my asking him, and he asked me to go with him; you know well enough that I couldn't refuse.
He does not know the woman, and she has pleasures, griefs, loves, in which he has no part.
"Well and good; and now go back nicely to your place, and, above all, no more jealousy."
"You know that I shouldn't be able to sleep there."
Then, when God allows love to a courtesan, that love, which at first seems like a pardon, becomes for her almost without penitence.
I make these reflections to day.
"Do you know that I am really afraid that I shall get very fond of you? Ask Prudence."
Now that all is irrevocably ended, they a rise naturally out of what has taken place.
"What is the matter with you to night?" said Marguerite, rising and coming to the back of the box and kissing me on the forehead.
Either Marguerite was very clever in deception, or she had conceived for me one of those sudden passions which are revealed in the first kiss, and which die, often enough, as suddenly as they were born.
She kissed me again, and I left the box.
"Well, do it for me, for I swear to you that I don't love you as the others have loved you."
Never had I gone to a theatre so early.
"You love, then, a little?"
I did not make these reflections on the morning when I returned home. They could but have been the presentiment of what was to happen to me, and, despite my love for Marguerite, I did not foresee such consequences.
But when the man who inspires this redeeming love is great enough in soul to receive it without remembering the past, when he gives himself up to it, when, in short, he loves as he is loved, this man drains at one draught all earthly emotions, and after such a love his heart will be closed to every other.
"Good evening," I replied to both Marguerite and Prudence.
"Where?"
"Yes, it is.
One day a young man is passing in the street, he brushes against a woman, looks at her, turns, goes on his way.
"Yes."
"Wretch!"
As for me, I no longer remembered how I had lived before that night. My whole being was exalted into joy at the memory of the words we had exchanged during that first night.
"Yes; I sent him to fetch some sweets, so that we could talk by ourselves for a moment.
"Listen," she said; "take the little gilt key on the mantelpiece, open that door; bring me back the key and go.
"Sit down."
The count will be coming back, and there is nothing to be gained by his finding you here."
See how young girls are watched and guarded!
"Here are my orders: To night at the Vaudeville.
The woman becomes the man's mistress and loves him.
"It is not for that reason."
"Can you ask?"
"At home."
Was I the cause of this coquetry?
Their two existences are henceforth one; they have scarcely begun to know one another when it seems as if they had known one another always, and all that had gone before is wiped out from the memory of the two lovers.
"You should go to bed," she replied, with that ironical air which went so well with her delicate and witty face.
How strong he feels with his cruel right to say: You do no more for love than you have done for money. They know not what proof to give.
"Because you don't like seeing him."
She came to the front at once, looked around the stalls, saw me, and thanked me with a look.
"Now, you must go back to your seat.
Your question becomes unnecessary and my answer useless."
Prudence was standing looking around the place; Marguerite, seated on the sofa, was meditating.
"Precisely."
"And why could you not let me come up?"
"Why did you bring Prudence?" I asked her.
"How can my visit change your plans?
You do not accept the position, you reject it as unworthy of you; you are an ordinary lover. Do like the others; pay me, and say no more about it."
"He wants you to forgive him."
"Here it is.
Never do they give you advice which is not lucrative.
"Look here, Prudence; do you know what he wants?" said Marguerite.
"Your letter undeceived me; it showed me that you lacked the intelligence of the heart; it did you more harm with me than anything you could possibly have done.
"May we see the bedroom?"
Well, I loved you all at once, as much as my dog.
"Pardon, pardon," I murmured.
"One has to; but he wants more than that."
Their friendship is carried to the point of servility, never to that of disinterestedness.
Then they become our friends, or rather our guests at table.
"Because she was at the theatre with me, and because when I leave here I want to have some one to see me home."
"This is the third time that I have forgiven you."
"Could not I do?"
"Go," I said, asking myself who it could be at such an hour, and not daring to believe that it was Marguerite.
"You in the way, Marguerite!
"And you do?"
"And do you consent?"
Because when you saw me spitting blood you took my hand; because you wept; because you are the only human being who has ever pitied me.
"Yes, sir."
Marguerite drew the letter from her bosom, and handing it to me with a smile of infinite sweetness, said:
It is true that for twelve years of her life she used to beat me.
When he died I cried more than when my mother died.
"By the way," she added, turning to me, "Nanine will be gone to bed.
"My dear Prudence," I answered, "you do not know what you are saying."
For these people we have to be merry when they are merry, well when they want to sup, sceptics like themselves.
"Then I met you, young, ardent, happy, and I tried to make you the man I had longed for in my noisy solitude.
At this moment Prudence reappeared.
Thereupon Joseph entered.
It was hardly an hour after Joseph and I had begun preparing for my departure, when there was a violent ring at the door.
I was looking forward to seeing you at twelve, to having lunch with you, and wiping out, by seeing you, a thought which was with me incessantly, and which, before I knew you, I had no difficulty in tolerating.
You must open the door; take my key, and try not to lose it again."
I listened, and I gazed at Marguerite with admiration.
We are sometimes obliged to buy the satisfaction of our souls at the expense of our bodies, and we suffer still more, when, afterward, that satisfaction is denied us."
Honestly, do you care for me a little?"
Your letter gave me a great deal of pain.
"I think that you are two children who haven't an atom of sense between you; but I also think that I am very hungry, and that the sooner you consent the sooner we shall have supper."
I have not come to hinder you from leaving Paris.
It was jealousy certainly, but ironical and impertinent jealousy.
"What do you think?"
"Sir," said Joseph coming back to me, "it is two ladies."
"All of it?"
"A great deal."
"Then why did you deceive me?"
I embraced Marguerite until she was almost stifled.
But how?"
"He wants to have supper with us."
"Yes."
"What, then?"
We are not allowed to have hearts, under penalty of being hooted down and of ruining our credit.
"What a nice place you've got!" Prudence went on.
"Come," said Marguerite, "there is room for the three of us in my carriage."
I have come because I had no time to answer you during the day, and I did not wish to let you think that I was angry with you. Prudence didn't want me to come; she said that I might be in the way."
Forget the rest and remember only one thing: that we belong to one another, that we are young, and that we love.
I came out of my room.
"If there were any other, I would tell you; for we are not to have any secrets from one another now."
She kissed me on the forehead, and said:
Naturally we have no friends.
"Yes, but, besides not wishing to put you out, I was sure that if you came as far as my door you would want to come up, and as I could not let you, I did not wish to let you go away blaming me for saying 'no'"
During this remark Marguerite looked at me attentively.
We are no longer beings, but things. We stand first in their self esteem, last in their esteem.
Our hearts have their caprices; it is their one distraction and their one excuse.
I was already feeling sad when I received your letter.
"We no longer belong to ourselves.
"Is that really the only reason?"
"It is we, Armand," cried a voice that I recognised as that of Prudence.
I tore the letter into fragments and kissed with tears the hand that gave it to me.
"Cert'nly, Brer Possum.
Cert'nly," replied ol' Mistah Buzzard.
"Please, mr Buzzard, please tell us the story," he begged.
Oh, my, no!
It was a very interesting story, and it had been listened to with the closest attention by a lot of the little meadow and forest people.
Everybody laughed, for everybody knows that no one asks more questions than peter Rabbit.
"Why, I thought it was warm down south!" interrupted peter Rabbit.
Everybody looked at peter and laughed.
Of course that make a terrible mess an' a powerful lot of smoke an' hot ashes fly up the chimney.
twelve
He was curious about that black headed cousin of ol' Mistah Buzzard, very curious indeed.
This sounded like another story.
peter laughed with the rest, although he looked a wee bit foolish.
You know he hasn't a feather on it, and it is very, very red.
But he don't mind that.
She so scared she tip over a whole kettleful of soup right in the fire.
But no one said anything, and after a minute or two ol' Mistah Buzzard explained.
They like to choke that no 'count Buzzard to death.
"That was a splendid story, mr Buzzard," said he, "and I'm ever and ever so much obliged to you.
peter Rabbit pricked up his ears.
peter made a funny face and laughed too.
Everybody looked surprised.
WHY THERE IS A BLACK HEAD IN THE BUZZARD FAMILY
A little sigh of satisfaction went around the circle of listeners.
"Mah fam'ly name is Vulture," said he.
Besides, he rather enjoys telling stories.
As usual, peter Rabbit was the first to speak.
"If you please, how does your cousin happen to have a black head?" asked peter as politely as he knew how.
"Because his grandpap asked too many questions," replied ol' Mistah Buzzard, slyly winking at the others.
You see, no one ever had heard him called anything but Buzzard.
Now ol' Mistah Buzzard is naturally good-natured and accommodating, and when peter begged so hard, he just couldn't find it in his heart to refuse.
"So it is, Brer Rabbit!
ol' Mistah Buzzard had just told the story of why he has a bald head and is proud of it.
"Don't ask me any questions, Miss Innes.
Out of deference to Liddy they washed their dishes once a day, and they concocted queer messes, according to their several abilities.
His recovery was destined to be almost as sudden as his disappearance, and was due directly to the tramp Alex had brought to Sunnyside.
The doctor was puffing somewhat when we finally came to a halt.
They had one triumph that they ate regularly for breakfast, and that clung to their clothes and their hair the rest of the day.
"It's no place for a woman," I heard him protesting angrily.
In spite of myself, I drew my breath in sharply.
"Something is going to occur," he said.
He carried something over his shoulder which I could not make out.
Between them I caught a glimpse of starlight shining down on rows of white headstones and an occasional more imposing monument, or towering shaft.
But if anything is going to occur, don't dare to let me miss it."
"Now, Miss Innes," he said gently.
Thus, there is a sense of desecration, of a reversal of the everlasting fitness of things, in resurrecting a body from its mother clay.
In this way we walked for perhaps twenty minutes.
I asked no questions.
"I never expected to come to this," he said once.
There was a period of stress, I think, while the heavy coffin was being raised.
"I have none," I said happily.
They were talking confidentially together, but when I came down they ceased.
It was bacon, hardtack and onions, fried together.
"Miss Innes," he said, stopping me as I was about to go to my room up stairs, "how are your nerves tonight?"
mr Jamieson called the hospital, while we crowded around him.
Once, indeed-but mr Jamieson said it was an owl, and I tried to believe him.
"There's one thing sure-I'll not be suspected of complicity.
We were on the edge of the Casanova churchyard.
"The most unusual thing I can think of would be a peaceful night.
"I mean," he persisted, "do you feel as though you could go through with something rather unusual?"
'Hang it!
In patient endurance of evil, she forgets it is our duty to admonish our neighbours of their transgressions.
mr and mrs Hattersley have been staying at the Grove a fortnight: and as mr Hargrave is still absent, and the weather was remarkably fine, I never passed a day without seeing my two friends, Milicent and esther, either there or here.
'But should you wish yourself to be like him?'
Where's Milicent?'
Could it be to dash away a tear?
'Oh, no! I couldn't stand that.'
'You can't continue as bad as you are without getting worse and more brutalised every day, and therefore more like him.'
'Fire and fury-'
'Think of what she was five years ago, when you married her, and what she is now.'
'She's there, just coming in with her sister.'
'It's her own delicate health, and confound it, madam! what would you make of me?--and the children, to be sure, that worry her to death between them.'
What do you think of that?'
'Nay, not I,' said he, turning her round, and pushing her towards me. 'Thank her; it's her doing.'
CHAPTER forty two
september first.--No mr Huntingdon yet.
Perhaps he will stay among his friends till Christmas; and then, next spring, he will be off again.
no'
Not years, for she's only five and twenty.'
I could not help smiling at the comical, half angry, half confounded look he put on at this rather unusual mode of address.
'You never tried me, Milly,' said he.
'God help me, then-for I'm sure I need it.
Shortly after they took their leave.
Since you will mistake her silence for indifference, come with me, and I'll show you one or two of her letters-no breach of confidence, I hope, since you are her other half.'
I followed at a little distance.
How very, very good you are!'
'Well, I'm not thirty yet; it isn't too late, is it?'
'Well, I think you're better without him, sure enough-for my part, I'm downright weary of him.
'Then why lay the blame on them?--I'll tell you what it is: it's silent fretting and constant anxiety on your account, mingled, I suspect, with something of bodily fear on her own.
'I know they are-bless them!'
'Never mind my plain speaking,' said I; 'it is from the best of motives. But tell me, should you wish your sons to be like mr Huntingdon-or even like yourself?'
'no'
'Of course not; and I don't, and I'm not going to.'
'What is the cause of it then?
If you intend to reform, invoke God's blessing, His mercy, and His aid; not His curse.'
But hang it!--that's not my fault.'
It's well these women must be blabbing.
mr Huntingdon then went up stairs.
Unluckily for me, he was more sober that night than he usually is at such an hour.
He then rang the bell.
'Benson, your mistress has broken the candle; bring another.'
'And so,' said he at length, 'you thought to disgrace me, did you, by running away and turning artist, and supporting yourself by the labour of your hands, forsooth?
And as I departed, he went on cursing and abusing my faithful friend and servant with epithets I will not defile this paper with repeating.
I am a slave-a prisoner-but that is nothing; if it were myself alone I would not complain, but I am forbidden to rescue my son from ruin, and what was once my only consolation is become the crowning source of my despair.
'What great discovery have you made now, mr Huntingdon?
I try to look to Him and raise my heart to heaven, but it will cleave to the dust.
'I didn't say I'd broken it, did I?' returned he.
CHAPTER forty
'And I know, too,' said he, suddenly seizing my closed hand and rudely abstracting them from it.
'Not in money matters, exactly, it seems; but it's best to keep out of the way of temptation.'
'What keys?'
And putting the keys into his pocket, he walked into the library.
And you thought to rob me of my son, too, and bring him up to be a dirty Yankee tradesman, or a low, beggarly painter?'
He then took up one of the candles and relighted it by thrusting it into the fire.
'Now, then,' sneered he, 'we must have a confiscation of property.
'Who told you this?' said she.
'And now, Lady Lowborough,' continued I, 'let me counsel you to leave this house as soon as possible.
But God have mercy on his miserable soul! and make him see and feel his guilt-I ask no other vengeance!
'But I cannot go, Helen, before the time appointed for our departure.
I sometimes think I ought to give him credit for the good feeling he simulates so well; and then again, I think it is my duty to suspect him under the peculiar circumstances in which I am placed.
I have done well to record them so minutely.
'Give me no thanks; it is not for your sake that I refrain.
'You use hard words, mrs Huntingdon, but I can pardon you.'
'Yes, yes, of course,' said she, interrupting me with a gesture of impatience.
Her impudence astounded me; but I complied, and followed her into the library.
The word stares me in the face like a guilty confession, but it is true: I hate him-I hate him!
'Suppose I do?'
'No one: I am not incapable of seeing for myself.'
Yet why so long for their departure?
'Annabella will excuse us,' said she; 'she's busy reading.'
'I shall not tell him.'
Evening.--Breakfast passed well over: I was calm and cool throughout.
'If I were suspicious,' I replied, 'I should have discovered your infamy long before.
'I am too well acquainted with your character and conduct to feel any real friendship for you, and as I am without your talent for dissimulation, I cannot assume the appearance of it.
She coloured again excessively, and remained silent, pressing her finger against her teeth, and gazing into the fire.
I would not for much that she should know the infamy and disgrace of her relation!'
No, Lady Lowborough, I do not found my charge upon suspicion.'
some of us at least.
Then she took a fancy into her head that she ought to accept this piece of good fortune for the sake of the family, and forget herself.
"How happy they seem; oh, dear!" said Polly, and trudged on, wondering if her turn would ever come and fearing that it was impossible.
It 's always so refreshing to me to see a little bit of the country, as it were, especially at this season."
"Yes, it 's the pleasantest walk we have; don't you think so?" asked the artful young man, laying a trap, into which Polly immediately fell.
There was a dreadful little pause, which Polly broke by saying abruptly; "How is Fan?"
Polly did n't say that quite naturally, and Sydney gave her a quick look, as he asked; "Do you get tired of old friends, too, Miss Polly?"
I wish the other trouble could be cured as easily as this."
What would your blessed mother say to hear such expressions from you?
"Who is here, Katy?"
"Willy likes Flossy best, so stop crying and come right along, you naughty child."
Minnie happened to be poorly that week and took no lesson, so Uncle Syd was deprived of his last hope, and looked as if his allowance of sunshine had been suddenly cut off.
But with Fanny and Polly he showed the domestic traits and virtues which are more engaging to womanly women than any amount of cool intellect or worldly wisdom.
At a street corner, a black eyed school boy was parting from a rosy faced school girl, whose music roll he was reluctantly surrendering.
"You seem to find it so." And Polly laughed, with a sudden sparkle in her eyes.
"Do you go as usual?"
He understood, and being a gentleman, made no fuss.
The more proposals, the more credit.
"It don't do to think of her, and I won't!" said Polly to herself, setting her lips with a grim look that was not at all becoming.
"I won't think of myself, or try to mend one mistake by making another," she said with a heavy sigh.
But Polly's education had been neglected, and after a good deal of natural indecision she did what most women do in such cases, thought she would "wait and see."
"Ah, you never see her at her best.
"Minnie said the other day she wished she was a pigeon so she could paddle in the puddles and not fuss about rubbers."
"I just gave him a hint and he took it.
"Yes."
I know it 's considered proper for girls to shut their eyes and let things come to a crisis no matter how much mischief is done.
I wonder why such a love of conquest was put into us? Mother says a great deal of it is owing to bad education nowadays, but some girls seem born for the express purpose of making trouble and would manage to do it if they lived in a howling wilderness.
She did not mean to tell, but his frankness was so agreeable she forgot herself.
"no"
"Have you given up teaching the Roths?" asked Sydney, changing the subject.
"Dashing, as ever.
She really could n't help it, it was so pleasant to see him again, just when she was feeling so lonely.
What wicked creatures we are!
I never had much faith in the remarkable coincidence of his always happening home to dinner just as I go to give the Roths their lesson.
This had an especial charm to Polly, for she soon found that this side of his character was not shown to every one.
"Truly?"
ON the evening of Fan's visit, Polly sat down before her fire with a resolute and thoughtful aspect.
As poor little Dido was jerked away by the unsympathetic maid, and Purple gaiters essayed in vain to plead his cause, Polly said to herself, with a smile and a sigh; "How early the old story begins!"
"Yes, indeed!
I could do so much for all at home how I should enjoy that!" And Polly let her thoughts revel in the luxurious future her fancy painted.
"I know it, but people sometimes get tired of old ways and like to try new ones."
"Oh, but I don't!
"Yes."
"Don't you think he means to?"
"no"
"What have you been doing with yourself lately?" asked Fanny, composing herself, with her back toward the rapidly waning light.
I do think Fan would suit him excellently by and by.
"Take hold of Master Charley's hand, Miss Mamie, and walk pretty, like Willy and Flossy," said the maid.
He was gone before she could do anything but look up at him with a remorseful face, and she walked on, feeling that the first and perhaps the only lover she would ever have, had read his answer and accepted it in silence.
"Not often; but"
Let me see, how can I begin?
"Who got up that nice idea, I should like to know?" demanded Polly, as Fanny stopped for breath.
Won't you stop a bit, Miss Polly?"
Polly Sydney don't sound well, and mrs Arthur Sydney don't seem to fit me a bit.
Oh, me!
"Nothing particular.
"Don't you think he cared for you, dear?" asked Fanny, presently.
"Only mr Sydney and Master Tom.
They all think a great deal of him because he is so hard to please, and almost any of them would feel immensely flattered if he liked them, whether they chose to marry him or not.
Polly, I 'm ashamed of you!
"How lovely the park looks," she said, in great confusion.
Trix treats Tom shamefully, and he bears it like a lamb.
I don't think it was his wealth, accomplishments, or position that most attracted Polly, though these doubtless possessed a greater influence than she suspected.
"I saw you from the Shaws' window and took the liberty of running after you by the back street," he said, laughing.
Oh, Polly, Polly, what a stupid speech to make, when you had just given him to understand that you were tired of the park!
This finished Polly's indecision, and after that night she never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant temptation which came in a guise particularly attractive to a young girl with a spice of the old Eve in her composition.
"Truly, Fan."
CHAPTER fourteen.
"What an easy life I should have plenty of money, quantities of friends, all sorts of pleasures, and no work, no poverty, no cold shoulders or patched boots.
There was no answer to her question, but she was satisfied and putting her arm round her friend, she said, in her most persuasive tone, "My precious Polly, do I know him?"
Don't he love back again?"
"Oh, Polly, I am so glad!
Two great tears rolled down Polly's cheeks, and Fanny wiped them away, feeling an intense desire to go West by the next train, wither Maria Bailey with a single look, and bring Tom back as a gift to Polly.
"Then I shall wait." And Polly's face changed so beautifully that Fan hugged her on the spot, fervently wishing that Maria Bailey never had been born.
"You don't look a bit natural.
"I 'm willing, but you must let me see the letter.
"Once or twice, but sort of jokingly, and I thought it was only some little flirtation.
"And is he very wise, good, and splendid, dear?"
"Tell me, truly, have you never repented of your hint to Sydney?"
"Could n't help it tried not to but it was so hard you know, Fan, you know," said a stifled voice from the depths of the very fuzzy cushion which Tom had once condemned.
"Prepare yourself somebody is engaged!" she said, in a solemn tone, that made Polly put up her hand as if to ward off an expected blow.
"It does look bad.
"I won't, but now I 'm not afraid to tell you that I think, I hope, I do believe that Sydney cares a little for me.
I 'm proper glad to find you looking so well and happy.
"You have seen him."
Tom wrote once a week to his mother, but the letters were short and not very satisfactory, for men never do tell the interesting little things that women best like to hear.
What do you say Ned answered when you asked about this inconvenient girl?" said Fanny turning hopeful all at once.
I try not to deceive myself, but it does seem as if there was a chance of happiness for me."
"Too late, let me tell you is that door shut, and Maud safe?"
The silence never lasts long, however, for the feminine desire to "talk it over" usually gets the better of the deepest emotion.
"no"
Fanny forwarded her bits of news to Polly.
"no
"Really my sister!
Don't be so fierce, Polly; you quite frighten me."
Since then he has n't mentioned Maria, so I was sure there was something serious going on, and being in Tom's confidence, he kept quiet."
S." was a domestic man, and admired housewifely accomplishments.
"What do you mean?
Fanny reconnoitered, and returning, listened breathlessly, while Polly poured into her ear the bitter secret which was preying on her soul.
"Thank heaven for that!" cried Polly, with the heartiest satisfaction in her voice.
"If it is true about Maria, what shall we do?" said Fanny after a pause.
"He ought to be if you love him.
"On my honor, as anything you please.
Fortunately every one was so busy with the necessary preparations that there was no time for romance of any sort, and the four young people worked together as soberly and sensibly as if all sorts of emotions were not bottled up in their respective hearts.
But you see Tom always seems so like a boy, and you are more womanly for your age than any girl I know, so I never thought of your caring for him in that way.
"On your honor, as an honest girl?"
She never said much of herself in her letters, and Fanny's first exclamation when they met again, was an anxious "Why, Polly, dear! Have you been sick and never told me?"
Polly did not look sick, though her cheeks were thinner and her color paler than formerly, but she seemed spiritless, and there was a tired look in her eyes that went to Fanny's heart.
Like I always said, honesty sure pays, even if it kills you.
"Why don't you pull off the planet, Fats?
"Yeah.
Thought you'd be in the chips!"
Bruce Gordon nodded slowly.
Chapter seventeen
The man dropped to another stool, rolling dice casually between his thumbs.
It's up to them to take it or lose it."
Damn it, we sent you here to get results, and you got them.
We're not throwing the book at you, Bruce.
"We know about Murdoch, and we know where Trench is-but he's a good citizen now, so he can stay there.
The car pulled up to the waiting rocket, and the Security man helped him up the steps with a perfunctory wish for good luck.
She's had bad luck with men."
"We can't know in our lifetime.
It was almost good to get out into the filth of the slums, and be heading back to the still standing monument of the old Chicken Coop.
For the time being, the hoods and punks were having a tough time of it, with working papers demanded as constant identification.
"Maybe you should have got me that night, Fats."
Out at the spaceport, ships were dropping down from Deimos with the supplies that had been held up so long, and a long line of trucks went snaking by.
Gordon dropped to a stool, slipping off his helmet.
Only Gordon and Sheila were left.
This time, it even tasted good to him.
"Guess I'll have to stick to selling meals, mostly-for a while, at least.
"You can't stay here.
"And bring out a steak, there!
Izzy shook his head.
She's out shopping!"
"Hello, Gordon.
"That's Mars," Gordon echoed the other's comment.
He headed for the private entrance out of habit, and then shrugged as he realized it was a needless precaution now.
He grabbed Gordon's hand and waddled down the landing plank.
It's Mercury!"
Gordon grinned wryly. Schulberg's volunteers were official, now.
Then he stopped.
Guess a man gets used to anything ...
He muttered to himself as he headed over the rubble toward the previously domed section.
You could go back to Earth, I'd guess."
Spent four weeks down there.
You look as if you could stand it-and Fats don't forget old friends!"
"All right.
Gordon sighed.
There was a man coming from Earth on a second ship who would see him.
"Did you think we'd let you go without seeing you off, cobber?" he asked.
The other shook his head.
And I've paid her the pay we owe you from the time you began using your badge.
"So I get sent to Mercury?"
He moved up the front steps and through the battered seal.
You're a fighter.
He reached automatically for the glass of ether needled beer.
Credit had been established again, and the businesses were open.
Finally got our orders for you.
"I can't say it, either, gov'nor-but some day, I'm going to have one of those badges myself.
"On the house, copper," Fats' voice said.
The other nodded.
They gave him a chauffeur back to the Chicken Coop, and politely indicated that it would be better if he stayed within reach.
She'd asked no questions and hadn't even tried to convince him that he'd be sent back to Earth now.
Gordon moved automatically toward the Seventh Ward.
Wrecks were being broken up, with salvageable material used for newer homes. Gordon came to a row of temporary bubbles, individual dwellings built like the dome, but opaque for privacy.
Izzy, you tell him."
Gordon grinned wryly; Fats would probably make more than ever.
All we can do is to hope.
"That's Mars." He rolled the dice out, then picked them up again.
It was three days before Bruce Gordon made up his mind to hunt up Security; another four days passed after they had sent him back to wait until they received orders from Headquarters for him.
He heard her coming down the old stairs, and ducked out through the private exit, snapping his helmet in place as he went through the seal. She must have sensed his desire to be left alone, since she made no attempt to follow.
They'll find out too much eventually." He paused, estimating Gordon.
"I wonder if it's worth it," Gordon said slowly.
We'll probably get this Mother Corey and Isaacs elected properly; and for a while, things will improve.
But I wish you'd tell my wife sometime that-well, that I didn't just run out on her.
He finished the meal, accepted a pack of the Earth cigarettes that sold at a luxury price here, and went out into the thin air of Mars.
He grinned again.
But his old eyes were glinting.
Here!"
And there's hell brewing on Mercury-worse than here.
With a yellow ticket, again-but without any razzle dazzle this time.
"She already knows," the Security man said.
The dome had exploded outwards, with only bits of it falling back; and the buildings had come through the outward explosion of the pressure with little damage.
Fats' Place was still open, though the crooked tables had been removed.
There was a grin on the other's face.
Let's say you've shifted some of the misery around a bit, and given them a chance to do better.
Hell, maybe I can hire some bums to sit around and whoop it up when the ships come in, and bill this as a real old Martian den of sin!
The dome had been down a full week when he watched the last of Randolph's equipment packed onto a truck and hauled away.
We've got permission to send you there, if you'll go.
Security had finally gotten around to him, it seemed. Inside the hallway, the Security man who'd first sent him to Mars was waiting.
SECURITY PAYOFF
I went back, about ten years ago.
"All right.
The old charter for Marsport from North America was dead, and the whole city was now under Security charter, like the rest of the planet.
Then Bruce Gordon stopped as great arms surrounded him.
They had been lucky.
And while it lasted, at least, Marsport was beginning to have its face lifted.
But there'll be pushers as long as weak men turn to drugs, and graft as long as voters allow the thing to get out of their hands.
We sent twenty others the same way-and they failed.
Rusty was busy opening his bar, and the others were all busy.
He found himself liking the other.
The one good thing about the captain, Gordon decided, was that he believed in doing his own dirtiest work.
They rode on further in silence, until Gordon broke the ice to ease the tension.
Some of Mars' laws dated from the time when law enforcement had been hampered by lack of men, rather than by the type of men.
For a second, Gordon cursed himself.
"Knock them out and kick them down!" Murdoch yelled.
"Ever see a Martian election?
He opened up a box on his desk and pulled out six heavy wooden sticks, each thirty inches long and nearly two inches in diameter.
The number of muggings and holdups in the section was going down.
We're covered, Gordon.
Bruce Gordon was trapped; he couldn't break his job with the police-if he did, he'd be brought back as a criminal.
But you got Earth ideas of the stuff, like I had once.
The week moved on.
He's let me come in because he figures it will get him more votes.
"We'd better shift to another territory," Murdoch decided.
At the front of each building, a dim phosphor bulb glowed; when darkness fell, they would have nothing else to see by.
The groups grew more experienced, and Murdoch was training a new squad every night.
After that, the watchers began to melt away.
Too bad." He sighed ponderously.
Take me, cobber.
The pressure was enough to get them for him.
But it's going to be tough on them."
Okay, men, let's go."
Murdoch bunched them together.
There was a crude lighting system here, put up by the citizens.
"And you'll turn honest all over, now you're in uniform.
No graft.
Two more groups were given the treatment.
He swallowed the sentiment; his own club was moving now.
He picked out five of the men, including Gordon "You five will come with me.
Citizens were appearing on the streets at night for the first time in years.
But Marsport had flourished enough to kill it off.
"Damn it, you're men, not sharks.
His screams were almost worse than the beating but names began to come. Gordon took them down, and then returned with the man to the others.
No, you're a firster.
There was a shaped grip on each, with a thong of leather to hold it over the wrist.
The Stonewall gang numbered perhaps five hundred.
The hoodlums tossed the man aside easily, and let out a yell.
"Colonel, they'd kill me! I don't know."
"He squealed," he announced.
It fitted with the dire predictions of Security, and with the spying Gordon was going to do-according to them.
And then hell is going to pop, and this whole planet may be blown wide open!"
Murdoch nodded.
"What makes you think Wayne will be re-elected?
Murdoch sent one of the men to pick up a second squad of six, and then a third.
But the Stonewall gang is backing Wayne.
And police had been taken off the beats there after it grew unsafe even for men in pairs to patrol the area.
"The gang?"
Your job is to protect the citizens here-and that means everyone not breaking the laws-whether you feel like it or not.
You'll get double pay here, and you can live on it!"
A skilled man could knock a knife, or even a heavy club, out of another's hand with a single flick of the wrist.
"I've got a yellow ticket, from Security."
Because Izzy is always honest, according to how he sees it.
Captain Murdoch was an unknown factor, and now was asking for more men.
Murdoch shrugged.
"Line them up."
The first man making a shakedown will get the same treatment we're going to use on the Stonewall boys.
"Get a stretcher, and take him wherever he belongs," he ordered.
Nobody had tried to get in touch with him.
The other four cops had come in reluctantly.
I've got a free hand, and we're going to run this the way we would on Earth.
Gordon found a section away from the others.
Besides, it'll show on the books that they didn't kick into his fund.
Bruce Gordon grimaced.
Because every time one of my men sees one of you, this will happen again.
But whatever your reasons, you'll be useful.
And he'd had practice.
"A good clubbing beats hanging," he told them.
The gang had begun to break up, but the nucleus would be the last to go. The police had orders to beat any member on sight, now.
Murdoch indicated one who stood with his shoulders shaking and tears running down his cheeks.
He brought him to the ground with a single blow across the kidneys.
"I want the name of every man in the gang you can remember," he told the man.
"To find a phone and call the wagon."
Gordon rode back in the official car with Murdoch and both were silent most of the way.
Cost 'em more, but they'd be respectable.
They rounded up the men of the gang, and one of the cops started off.
And you can pass the word along that the Stonewall gang is dead!"
The old book I got the idea from didn't mention that."
Gordon's eyes popped at that.
But this honesty stuff, it's like dope.
Chapter four
They were covering an area of six blocks one way, and two the other.
"Poor devils!"
The shopkeepers, and some of the less unfortunate people there, had protested loud enough to reach clear back to Earth.
Murdoch had fixed it so he'd be a squad leader, and that meant he'd be unable to step out of line.
Names."
From the buildings around, an assortment of toughs came at the double, swinging knives, picks, and bludgeons.
They had the names of nearly all of them, and some pretty good ideas of their hide outs.
Murdoch called, "Where are you going?"
At one time, there had been a small dome and a tiny city devoted to the rocket field.
"Then you should be ashamed to be in this mess.
Only now I'm respectable myself, they don't look so good.
Nobody wants him, except a gang of crooks and those in power."
Murdoch grinned bitterly.
He saw Murdoch's club dart in and take out two of the gang, one on the forward swing, one on the recover.
Bruce Gordon grinned slowly as he swung the stick, and Murdoch's eyes fell on him.
If a doctor's job was to prevent illness, instead of merely curing it, then why shouldn't it be a policeman's job to prevent crime?
A thin screech like a whistle came from Murdoch's Marspeaker, and the captain went forward, with Gordon at his heels.
"I'm leaving you two able to walk for that.
The man was totally unlike a Martian captain, and a knot of homesickness for Earth ran through his stomach.
He was a sick looking spectacle.
"Nope.
Moving in two groups of threes, at opposite sides of the street, they began their beat.
Now get out of this district, or get honest jobs!
"He'll win," Mother Corey repeated.
But there was little grumbling.
Standing beside Murdoch, they were moving forward.
You start out on a little, and you have to go all the way."
He discussed it with Mother Corey, who agreed that Wayne would be re-elected.
I can always go back to Earth, and I'll try to take you along.
Murdoch blinked.
It wasn't exactly legal; but nothing was, here.
But afterwards, he'll have me out; and then the boys with me will be marks for the gang when it comes back.
"If he should turn up dead, I'll know you boys are responsible, and I'll find you.
"Can't lose," the old man said.
There was no chance to save the citizen, who was dying from lack of air. Gordon felt the solid pleasure of the finely turned club in his hands. It was light enough for speed, but heavy enough to break bones where it hit.
"Earth cop!"
He can't lose!
Gordon nodded.
But the captain stirred finally, sighing.
"You're going to be busy," Murdoch announced shortly in the dilapidated building that had been hastily converted to a precinct house.
"And don't let them get away!"
Gordon saw grudging admiration in their eyes for Murdoch, who had taken more punishment than they had.
Go in for business, and don't stop just because the other guy quits.
When he was finished, he turned to two of the other captives.
This could lead to abuses, as he'd seen on Earth.
"It didn't affect Honest Izzy," Gordon pointed out.
After that, they began to go hunting for the members of the gang.
If they fought back, the pugnaciousness was knocked out of them at once.
Gordon's own squad was equipped with shields now, and they were doing better.
As the police swung around, one of the thugs casually ripped the airsuit open.
The squad went in, tired and sore; all had taken a severe beating in the brawls.
Take those two and give them some lessons, while I do the same with these."
Murdoch took his nod as evidence enough, and turned to the wretched toughs.
"Object lesson!"
Here, that was best done by wiping out the Stonewall gang to the last member.
Between times, they picked up what they could by mugging and theft, with a reasonable amount of murder thrown in at a modest price.
When the hoods came to, they found themselves helpless, and facing police with clubs.
CAPTAIN MURDOCH
He began wondering about Security, then.
It was soon over.
Gordon realized that the gang had figured that concentrating the police here meant other territories would be safe.
Suppose the whole gang jumps us at once?"
Gordon reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out, mixed with a vague relief.
Two of the Stonewall boys were working over a tall man in a newer airsuit.
"Two years," Gordon admitted.
Gordon jerked up in surprise.
Gordon nodded to a couple, and they grinned faintly at him. Damn it, Mars could be cleaned up....
So you're it!"
Now he held it out toward Gordon.
Gordon moved forward quickly, until he could make out the thin scar showing through the make-up over the man's eyes.
"Buy you a beer.
When it was over, the two picked up their whimpering captive.
You're not assigned here any more.
O'Neill had turned to run, and then seemed to think better of it.
With you out here and me busy nights doing a bit of convoy work on the side, we might as well not both live at Mother's."
"You can't do it to me!
Then another cop came around a corner at a run.
"Jet me!
"Thanks, Izzy."
You're right, gov'nor.
Use them!"
RECALL
Guns suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere. The gun dropped from O'Neill's hand as the wrist snapped, and the Stonewall chief let out a high pitched cry of pain.
I sure asked for that one.
Anyhow, you won't miss it.
Fifty fifty?"
If any members of the gang were around, they made no attempt to rescue him.
The other cop had yanked out O'Neill's wallet, and now tossed it to Gordon.
The heavy locust stick met the man's wrist before the weapon was half drawn-another gun!
You owe me some bills, gov'nor. Eleven hundred fifty credits.
"So you paid it.
There's no graft out here."
Then he stopped and looked back.
Right?"
His hand darted down to his belt, just as Gordon reached him.
When Gordon and Jenkins came back, Murdoch tossed the money to them.
He was suddenly in no mood to quibble with Izzy's personal code.
"Your legs are still whole.
"Long time no see.
"Hi, gov'nor," the little man greeted him.
"Like this social call?" Gordon asked him.
Bruce Gordon reached the outskirts of the miserable business section, noticing that a couple of the shops were still open.
Gordon hit the signal switch, and the Marspeaker let out a shrill whistle.
"Wrong, Izzy.
None of us are.
He grinned at himself, then something needled at his mind, until he swung back.
I never saw it. Gordon, you've got a visitor!"
And the slow, doubtful respect on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that Haley's system was working.
If they want to collect that dratted pledge of theirs, let them put me where I can make it.
Gordon shrugged and gave up.
Waiting for him was the lean, cynical little figure of Honest Izzy, complete with uniform and sergeant's stripes.
"Split it.
He'd been right-this was O'Neill, head of the Stonewall gang.
The cops had been passing them on the hope of finding one of the leaders.
Wearing their uniform makes me a temporary citizen!
It had probably been years since any had dared risk it after the sun went down.
He inspected the forged work papers, and jerked his thumb toward one of the hastily built cells where a doctor would look O'Neill over-eventually.
"Turn it in to Murdoch," Gordon said, and then cursed himself.
For a second, Izzy's face went blank; then he chuckled.
You guys earned it by keeping your hands off it.
I've been meaning to see you, so I volunteered to run out some red tape for your captain.
The captain looked completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped onto the bench.
"Huh?" Izzy turned it over, and shook his head.
It's been a pleasure working with you, Sergeant Gordon!"
Okay; I'm bloody well suckered, so forget it."
Gordon had heard of the friendly interest charged on the side here, but he shook his head.
The little guy knew Mars as few others did, apparently, from all sides.
The little man shook his head, his ancient eighteen year old face turning sober.
"I'm assigned here, Izzy, at least for another week, until after elections...."
It was night outside, and the phosphor bulbs at the corners glowed dimly, giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the extemporized precinct house.
But he shook his head.
Gordon went down the passage to the end of the hall, in the direction Murdoch had indicated.
The man staggered between them, whimpering at each step.
"All right," Gordon admitted.
The Force pays for my time during the day, and I figure my time's my own at night.
And if any of the other cops had private rackets of their own, Izzy was undoubtedly the man to find it out, and use the information.
Gordon pocketed the revolver with his free hand. "Walk, O'Neill!" he ordered.
The captain's face had been buried in a pile of papers, but now Murdoch came around to stare at the gang leader.
Jenkins, the other cop, had been holding the wallet.
You damned cops can't...." O'Neill was blubbering.
A thousand, interest at ten per cent a week, standard.
Finally he shrugged. "Don't matter, gov'nor.
I came out to tell you I got the sweetest beat in Marsport-over a dozen gambling joints on it-and I need a right gee to work it with me.
"Nope.
There must have been over two thousand credits in the wallet.
For a moment, Gordon wondered what Izzy had done to earn that beat, but he could guess.
With a beat such as that, even going halves, and with all the graft to the upper brackets, he'd still be able to make his pile in a matter of months.
Of course, if I ever catch myself doing anything shady during the day, I'll have to turn myself in. But it ain't likely." He grinned in satisfaction.
Some turned away as Gordon and the other cop went to work, but most of them weren't squeamish.
"Go on, accept, damn it.
I thought I had full responsibility to Earth, but he's got me.
"Thanks, yourself." The kid pocketed the money cheerfully, nodding.
He pulled out the bills and handed them over.
"One thing, though, I've still got enough authority to make you a sergeant.
Bruce Gordon nodded, grinning in spite of himself.
"Convoy duty, Izzy? Or dope running?"
"Whatever comes to hand, gov'nor.
Nothing about that in the pledge, and when you sign something, you gotta pay it.
I'm reformed; I'm going straight!
His voice was bitter, but he made no opening for them to question him as he picked up the papers and began going through them again.
It was kinder thin ice, but I says:
"Lize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away  or did you get your breakfast on the boat?"
But it didn't save him.
"I can't imagine," says the old gentleman; "and I must say it makes me dreadful uneasy."
Sally, it's terrible  just terrible  something's happened to the boat, sure!"
Yes, it was mortification  that was it.
So I says to myself, here's another place where I got to resk the truth. I opened my mouth to begin; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed, and says:
You must a met him on the road, didn't you?  oldish man, with a  "
I see I'd got to invent a bar, or forget the name of the one we got aground on  or  Now I struck an idea, and fetched it out:
"No," says her husband.
But I couldn't get no show, mrs Phelps kept it up and run on so.
"How'd you get your breakfast so early on the boat?"
That didn't help me much, though; for I didn't know the names of bars down that way.
I must go up the road and waylay him.
Don't you let on you're here.
He was a Baptist.
There ain't no harm in a hound, nohow.
But I go a good deal on instinct; and my instinct said she would be coming up  from down towards Orleans.
When we got there she set me down in a split bottomed chair, and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, and says:
The old gentleman stared, and says:
I went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just trusting to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come; for I'd noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth if I left it alone.
"I hain't no idea.
But if they was joyful, it warn't nothing to what I was; for it was like being born again, I was so glad to find out who I was.
They say he was a sight to look at.
So I told the folks I reckoned I would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage.
I said I had got it on the boat.
I had my mind on the children all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little, and find out who I was.
But they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their mouths, and hid behind her.
"Don't say yes'm  say Aunt Sally.
We been expecting you a couple of days and more.
I see I was in a fix now.
Being Tom Sawyer was easy and comfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a steamboat coughing along down the river.
Where'd she get aground?"
Well, I see I was up a stump  and up it good.
Mortification set in, and they had to amputate him.
He sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give mrs Phelps the chance she wanted.
Your uncle Silas knowed a family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well.
"It warn't the grounding  that didn't keep us back but a little.
Phelps' was one of these little one horse cotton plantations, and they all look alike.
"No, I didn't see nobody, Aunt Sally.
He  "
She grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both hands and shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down over; and she couldn't seem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying, "You don't look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would; but law sakes, I don't care for that, I'm so glad to see you!
We blowed out a cylinder head."
"Has he come?"
If I'd a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well.
When I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went for me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still.
And such another powwow as they made!
So then she started for the house, leading me by the hand, and the children tagging after.
"Yes'm  she  "
And he's gone again, not more'n an hour ago; he'll be back any minute now.
"No'm. Killed a nigger."
"Why, who's that?"
He turned blue all over, and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection.
I didn't rightly know what to say, because I didn't know whether the boat would be coming up the river or down.
And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger boys without anything on but tow linen shirts, and they hung on to their mother's gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful, the way they always do.
And s'pose he steps in here any minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet?
"Good gracious! anybody hurt?"
Then I says to myself, s'pose Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat?
Look yonder!  up the road!  ain't that somebody coming?"
I was getting so uneasy I couldn't listen good.
She was smiling all over so she could hardly stand  and says:
I see it warn't a bit of use to try to go ahead  I'd got to throw up my hand.
She stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and give me a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back from the window there she stood, a beaming and a smiling like a house afire, and I standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside.
And I think he died afterwards.
But there warn't no time to swap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on shaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary, and the rest of the tribe.
mrs Phelps she jumps for him, and says:
I'll play a joke on him. Children, don't you say a word."
"Not where I hid it I reckon it won't," I says.
Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty uncomfortable all up the other.
You must a missed him.
By jings, I most slumped through the floor!
"Well, it's lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt.
Your uncle's been up to the town every day to fetch you.
"Why, Silas!
"Uneasy!" she says; "I'm ready to go distracted!
"Oh, don't distress me any more'n I'm already distressed.
So she run on:
"Nobody."
Children, it's your cousin Tom!  tell him howdy."
All I say is, kings is kings, and you got to make allowances.
I didn't take notice nor let on.
They fetch her up. Next morning, 'Chop off her head!' And they chop it off.
'Ring up Fair Rosamun.' Fair Rosamun answers the bell.
I went to sleep, and Jim didn't call me when it was my turn.
This one's a middling hard lot for a duke.
Just a word, gentlemen." They stopped to listen.
House was jammed again that night, and we sold this crowd the same way.
"Well, how'd the old thing pan out this time, duke?" He hadn't been up town at all.
And look at Charles Second, and Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and james Second, and Edward Second, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain.
"Don't it s'prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?"
S'pose he opened his mouth  what then?
The duke says yes.
"Greenhorns, flatheads!
It's the way they're raised."
I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience, but nothing of the sort; pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam, and says:
"We are sold  mighty badly sold.
Ain't that sensible?" ("You bet it is!  the jedge is right!" everybody sings out.) "All right, then  not a word about any sell.
Go along home, and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy."
And  but never mind the rest of his outfit; it was just wild, but it was awful funny.
No  drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat.
"It's the way I feel, too, Jim.
Next day you couldn't hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show was.
But not very different.
'Fetch up Jane Shore,' he says; and up she comes, Next morning, 'Chop off her head'  and they chop it off.
How does he go at it  give notice?  give the country a show?
When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself.
Ask him to show up?
He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head next morning.
CHAPTER twenty three.
When he's drunk there ain't no near sighted man could tell him from a king."
We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village. Then we lit up and had a supper, and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way they'd served them people.
I knowed what it was about.
Well, when the place couldn't hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute, and then he started around for the stage door, I after him; but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says:
"Well, that's what I'm a saying; all kings is mostly rapscallions, as fur as I can make out."
My, you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom.
We struck the raft at the same time, and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream, all dark and still, and edging towards the middle of the river, nobody saying a word.
"What, is it over?
Well, what did he do?
He always done the other thing.
He often done that.
But a big, fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts:
Well, Henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country.
I says:
And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs.
Then there was a fine time.
"Well, it don't, because it's in the breed.
S'pose people left money laying around where he was  what did he do?
I stood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging, or something muffled up under his coat  and I see it warn't no perfumery, neither, not by a long sight.
What was the use to tell Jim these warn't real kings and dukes?
"You read about them once  you'll see.
Then we'll all be in the same boat.
'Fetch up Nell Gwynn,' he says.
Twenty people sings out:
"Hold on!
The duke says:
WELL, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a stage and a curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that night the house was jam full of men in no time.
Sometimes I wish we could hear of a country that's out of kings."
I done it, and he done the same.
I was a bilin'!
Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty five dollars in that three nights.
"Well, they all do, Jim.
"Walk fast now till you get away from the houses, and then shin for the raft like the dickens was after you!"
But we've got them on our hands, and we got to remember what they are, and make allowances.
"Yes, a duke's different.
If he didn't shut it up powerful quick he'd lose a lie every time.
The people most killed themselves laughing; and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes, they roared and clapped and stormed and haw hawed till he come back and done it over again, and after that they made him do it another time.
And, then, there he was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum  and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to the dressing room, and everybody just a howling with pleasure and astonishment.
He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits.
I could a stayed if I wanted to, but I didn't want to.
CHAPTER twenty two.
The bills said:
The racket stopped, and the wave sucked back.
Then he says, slow and scornful:
tear down the fence!" Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing, and down she goes, and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave.
Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people.
It's amusing.
And they laughed all the time, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway, before the show was over, but one boy which was asleep.
I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by, and then dived in under the tent.
It was a real bully circus.
Why don't your juries hang murderers?
So the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads couldn't come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted was low comedy  and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, he reckoned.
Your mistake is, that you didn't bring a man with you; that's one mistake, and the other is that you didn't come in the dark and fetch your masks.
Sherburn never said a word  just stood there, looking down.
Some sung out "Tear down the fence!
The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that's what an army is  a mob; they don't fight with courage that's born in them, but with courage that's borrowed from their mass, and from their officers.
He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on to nobody.
The crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and went tearing off every which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them, looking tolerable cheap.
So next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, and drawed off some handbills, and stuck them up all over the village.
It was a little twenty foot yard.
Why, it was one of his own men!
And so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I ever see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild.
Sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out gaze him, but they couldn't; they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky.
The stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable.
The average man don't like trouble and danger.
Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch, with a double barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, perfectly ca'm and deliberate, not saying a word.
He said he could size their style.
"Do I know you?
It warn't funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger. But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle, a reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a going like a house afire too.
THEY swarmed up towards Sherburn's house, a whooping and raging like Injuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush, and it was awful to see.
I don't know; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was, but I never struck them yet.
You can't be too careful.
I know you clear through.
They swarmed up in front of Sherburn's palings as thick as they could jam together, and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise.
"You didn't want to come.
I never knowed how clothes could change a body before.
"What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?"
And tell him to git himself up regardless.
"Did anybody send 'em word?"
"Git aboard," says the king.
"Too bad, too bad he couldn't a lived to see his brothers, poor soul. You going to Orleans, you say?"
The young fellow says:
"It's a pretty long journey.
Well, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied that young fellow.
Jim he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope.
He said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all over every time there was a sound.
Then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:
About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along, but they didn't come from high enough up the river; but at last there was a big one, and they hailed her.
When they're deep they won't stop for a hail.
Then he says:
Harvey and William's the only ones that's left now; and, as I was saying, they haven't got here in time."
"For the steamboat; going to Orleans."
I done so, and then we all three started on again.
The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost my ride, after all.
Shove along, now."
I done it.
Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and fell up against the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his back, and says:
"Funeral to morrow, likely?"
Then he says:
These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was so much money in it, but they judged it wouldn't be safe, because maybe the news might a worked along down by this time.
The duke told him to make himself free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone. Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he wouldn't wait for him to howl.
But it'll be lovely; wisht I was a going. Is Mary Jane the oldest?
NEXT day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns.
If they warn't the beatenest lot, them two frauds, that ever I struck.
"Yes, sir, it's the best way.
And that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to."
"Well, it's all terrible sad; but we've all got to go, one time or another.
When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up another mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:
Jim was satisfied.
"Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new carpet bags.
Then he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn't drop a carpet bag and bust out a crying.
Blamed if he didn't inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about Peter's business  which was a tanner; and about George's  which was a carpenter; and about Harvey's  which was a dissentering minister; and so on, and so on.
"Oh, yes, pretty well off.
"Mary Jane's nineteen, Susan's fifteen, and Joanna's about fourteen  that's the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare lip."
"Was peter Wilks well off?"
"Run her nose in shore," says the king.
So then they waited for a steamboat.
"How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?"
A Cincinnati boat will, but this is a saint Louis one."
But the king was ca'm.
When we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon she got off.
"Well, they could be worse off.
Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I got my paddle ready.
She sent out her yawl, and we went aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, and said they wouldn't land us.
He says:
"Yes, but that ain't only a part of it.
He had houses and land, and it's reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up som'ers."
I done it, of course.
"Because she's a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn't stop there.
He most desperately wanted to see Harvey  and William, too, for that matter  because he was one of them kind that can't bear to make a will.
peter and George were the only ones that come out here; George was the married brother; him and his wife both died last year.
"Oh, he lives in England  Sheffield  preaches there  hasn't ever been in this country.
Why, he didn't only look like he was dead, he looked considerable more than that.
"When did you say he died?"
Go for the steamboat, Huckleberry; we'll come down to the village on her."
How old is the others?"
The king's duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy.
Jump out and he'p the gentleman, Adolphus"  meaning me, I see.
"Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so."
I want to be near to them-to help them.
Olive Chancellor received this appeal with peculiar feelings.
Our movement is for all-it appeals to the most delicate ladies.
She had been laughed at, but she never knew it; she was treated as a bore, but she never cared.
I know several that I should like to have.
She knew her place in the Boston hierarchy, and it was not what mrs Farrinder supposed; so that there was a want of perspective in talking to her as if she had been a representative of the aristocracy.
Raise the standard among them, and bring me a thousand names.
"I can't talk to those people, I can't!" said Olive Chancellor, with a face which seemed to plead for a remission of responsibility.
The unhappiness of women!
"Have you got money?"
They cared far more about Charlie than about the ballot.
I want to do something-oh, I should like so to speak!"
She had been consumed by the passion of sympathy; it had crumpled her into as many creases as an old glazed, distended glove.
His family was ruined; they had lost their slaves, their property, their friends and relations, their home; had tasted of all the cruelty of defeat.
There was nothing in the world so personal as mrs Luna; her sister could have hated her for it if she had not forbidden herself this emotion as directed to individuals.
She saw (when once she had looked at him) that he would not put those worldly interpretations on things which, with her, it was both an impulse and a principle to defy.
The State of Mississippi seemed to him the state of despair; so he surrendered the remnants of his patrimony to his mother and sisters, and, at nearly thirty years of age, alighted for the first time in New York, in the costume of his province, with fifty dollars in his pocket and a gnawing hunger in his heart.
Miss Olive Chancellor, it may be confided to the reader, to whom in the course of our history I shall be under the necessity of imparting much occult information, was subject to fits of tragic shyness, during which she was unable to meet even her own eyes in the mirror.
This was written so intensely in her delicate face that he felt an unformulated pity for her before they had exchanged twenty words.
Nothing could be more displeasing than this indifference when people didn't agree with you.
She knew what her mother would have done, and that helped her decision; for her mother always chose the positive course.
Chancellor had passed away; so it was for Olive, left alone in the little house in Charles Street (Adeline being in Europe), to decide.
One of them was to the effect that the simplest division it is possible to make of the human race is into the people who take things hard and the people who take them easy.
It proved nothing of any importance, with regard to Miss Chancellor, to say that she was morbid; any sufficient account of her would lie very much to the rear of that.
She was reassured at finding that her visitor was peculiar; the way he spoke told her that it was no wonder he had fought on the Southern side.
One of these fits had suddenly seized her now, without any obvious cause, though, indeed, mrs Luna had made it worse by becoming instantly so personal.
That was the way he liked them-not to think too much, not to feel any responsibility for the government of the world, such as he was sure Miss Chancellor felt.
He had not, seeking his fortune, come away from the blighted South, which weighed upon his heart, to look out for tragedies; at least he didn't want them outside of his office in Pine Street.
It was the usual things of life that filled her with silent rage; which was natural enough, inasmuch as, to her vision, almost everything that was usual was iniquitous.
Whether much or little consideration had been directed to the result, Miss Chancellor certainly would not have incurred this reproach.
She had erected it into a sort of rule of conduct that whenever she saw a risk she was to take it; and she had frequent humiliations at finding herself safe after all.
She had no difficulty in asking him now whether he would not stay to dinner-she hoped Adeline had given him her message.
By the time Basil came to the North-making advances, as it were-mrs
He perceived very quickly that Miss Chancellor belonged to the former class.
If they would only be private and passive, and have no feeling but for that, and leave publicity to the sex of tougher hide!
It was the same sort of impulse that had moved her to write to Basil Ransom, in the spring, after hearing accidentally that he had come to the North and intended, in New York, to practise his profession.
He was on his guard against generalisations which might be hasty; but he had arrived at two or three that were of value to a gentleman lately admitted to the New York bar and looking out for clients.
She was perfectly safe after writing to Basil Ransom; and, indeed, it was difficult to see what he could have done to her except thank her (he was only exceptionally superlative) for her letter, and assure her that he would come and see her the first time his business (he was beginning to get a little) should take him to Boston.
The women he had hitherto known had been mainly of his own soft clime, and it was not often they exhibited the tendency he detected (and cursorily deplored) in mrs Luna's sister.
She had never yet encountered a personage so exotic, and she always felt more at her ease in the presence of anything strange.
It was "in the female line," as Basil Ransom had written, in answering her letter with a good deal of form and flourish; he spoke as if they had been royal houses.
Ransom was pleased with the vision of that remedy; it must be repeated that he was very provincial.
She was habited in a plain dark dress, without any ornaments, and her smooth, colourless hair was confined as carefully as that of her sister was encouraged to stray.
The young man was therefore free to look at her; a contemplation which showed him that she was agitated and trying to conceal it.
He was sorry for her, but he saw in a flash that no one could help her: that was what made her tragic.
He was too simple-too Mississippian-for that; she was almost disappointed.
But this pale girl, with her light green eyes, her pointed features and nervous manner, was visibly morbid; it was as plain as day that she was morbid.
He wondered why she was agitated, not foreseeing that he was destined to discover, later, that her nature was like a skiff in a stormy sea.
You look as if you were."
His dishonesty, however, only exposed him the more.
Try to reform him; a person from Mississippi is sure to be all wrong.
Don't come out; my sister has the first claim.
She didn't believe he had ever heard of her, mrs Luna, though he pretended, with his Southern chivalry, that he had.
He was tall and lean, and dressed throughout in black; his shirt collar was low and wide, and the triangle of linen, a little crumpled, exhibited by the opening of his waistcoat, was adorned by a pin containing a small red stone.
Basil Ransom coloured a little.
That's the way I found her when I returned from Europe."
Basil Ransom had got up just as mrs Luna made this last declaration; for a young lady had glided into the room, who stopped short as it fell upon her ears.
"You might have known what?"
mrs Luna explained to her sister that her freedom of speech was caused by his being a relation-though, indeed, he didn't seem to know much about them.
"If you thought I lived in New York, why in the world didn't you come and see me?" the lady inquired.
She's a female Jacobin-she's a nihilist.
"Well, that Miss Chancellor would be all that you say.
She hates it; she would like to abolish it.
Basil Ransom stared; the yellow light in his brown eyes deepened.
Good bye, mr Ransom," mrs Luna continued, gathering up the feathery white shawl which added to the volume of her fairness.
"Yes, very," Basil Ransom replied, with a smile, and the curious feminine softness with which Southern gentlemen enunciate that adverb.
Why, what's the use of that?
Are you very ambitious?
"But it isn't the same," she said.
They had invented it while she was away.
This is a LibriVox recording.
"Well, you see, I don't go out much, except to the courts."
She was attractive and impertinent, especially the latter.
If you are going to dine with her, you had better know it."
She was brought up in the city of reform."
"A radical?
This last remark he made at a venture, for he had, naturally, not devoted any supposition whatever to mrs Luna.
Perhaps that is one."
Neither five nor fifteen, and yet not ten exactly, but either nine or eleven.
"I pretend not to prevaricate."
And, indeed, he was very long, Basil Ransom, and he even looked a little hard and discouraging, like a column of figures, in spite of the friendly face which he bent upon his hostess's deputy, and which, in its thinness, had a deep dry line, a sort of premature wrinkle, on either side of the mouth.
"I am glad I haven't opinions that prevent my dressing in the evening!" she declared from the doorway.
"Oh, murder!" murmured the young man vaguely, sinking back in his chair with his arms folded.
mrs Luna looked up at all this, but saw only a part of it; otherwise she would not have replied in a bantering manner, in answer to his inquiry: "Are you ever different from this?" mrs Luna was familiar-intolerably familiar.
"Olive will come down in about ten minutes; she told me to tell you that.
"Do you mean the law courts?
In spite of this decoration the young man looked poor-as poor as a young man could look who had such a fine head and such magnificent eyes.
Then he said: "Oh yes; when I dine out I usually carry a six shooter and a bowie knife." And he took up his hat vaguely-a soft black hat with a low crown and an immense straight brim. mrs Luna wanted to know what he was doing.
And if she said it, she does really hope it.
mrs Luna glanced at him from head to foot, and gave a little smiling sigh, as if he had been a long sum in addition.
It might have been likened to a thin ray of moonlight resting upon the wall of a prison.
"Well, so it is; they are all witches and wizards, mediums, and spirit rappers, and roaring radicals."
BY HENRY james
He threw it down at the approach of mrs Luna, laughed, shook hands with her, and said in answer to her last remark, "You imply that you do tell fibs.
"While you and your little boy don't," the young man remarked.
"Have you been in Europe?" Ransom asked.
You only stay to morrow?
Well, mind you come and see me in New York; I shall be sure to be part of the winter there.
She stood there looking, consciously and rather seriously, at mr Ransom; a smile of exceeding faintness played about her lips-it was just perceptible enough to light up the native gravity of her face.
She made him sit down; she assured him that her sister quite expected him, would feel as sorry as she could ever feel for anything-for she was a kind of fatalist, anyhow-if he didn't stay to dinner.
His forehead was high and broad, and his thick black hair, perfectly straight and glossy, and without any division, rolled back from it in a leonine manner.
These words were spoken with much volubility by a fair, plump, smiling woman who entered a narrow drawing room in which a visitor, kept waiting for a few moments, was already absorbed in a book.
"No, I haven't been anywhere.
Has your sister?"
She is willing to risk that."
"Well, I suppose I might have known that," he continued, at last.
All LibriVox recordings are in the public domain.
"Mercy, yes!
"Just as I am?" the visitor inquired, presenting himself with rather a work a day aspect.
"Oh no, I never differ from Newton!" And mrs Luna added that now she was back she didn't know what she should do.
"That has an unflattering sound for me," said the young man.
"Daphne!" cried Hermon in grateful agitation; but she would not listen to him, and followed the soldier whom the captain detailed to guide her into the palace.
Then Daphne herself threw her arms around his neck with fervent devotion.
But Hermon, with drooping head, murmured: "To morrow I shall no longer be what I am now.
Words can not express the strength of my devotion, but for that very reason I must do what duty commands before I ask the question, 'Will you join your fate to mine?'"
Daphne taken from him, he knew not whither nor for how long a time, after he had just been assured of her great love!
In the name of the dead, he thanked his dear comrades for the enthusiastic appreciation his masterpiece had found.
"Forward!" he called blithely and boldly to the officer; while Crates, with loud lamentations, was protesting his innocence to the warrior who was putting fetters upon him.
The ill disposed insisted that Hermon had only done what duty commanded the meanest man, and the fact that he had deceived all Alexandria still remained.
The old man's conversation with Hermon was interrupted by the functionaries who subjected him and Crates to the examination.
I must remain blind; but you have restored the lost sight to my poor darkened soul.
When Thyone in her presence heard from Gras that Hermon intended to go to Proclus's banquet, she started up in horror, exclaiming, "Then the unfortunate man is lost!"
Daphne again pleaded for the liberation of the prisoners, but Philippus silenced her with the grave exclamation, "The order of the King!"
"What a terrible ordeal again awaits you!
Perhaps it would be well for him to leave Alexandria now, and she described how much benefit she had received while hunting from the silence of the wilderness, when she had left the noise of the city behind her.
The goal of the nocturnal walk, which was close at hand, was reached at the end of a few minutes, and the prisoners were delivered to the commander of the Diadochi.
Then Daphne, on her knees, besought the matron to tell her what threatened Hermon, and succeeded in persuading her to speak.
Bring this before your mind, and everything else that you must accept with it, if you consent, when the time arrives, to become mine. Conceal and palliate nothing!
The prisoner listened in surprise and anxiety.
"Oh, my poor, deceived love!" cried Daphne, strongly agitated, in a tone of the deepest sorrow.
Even Daphne's image, and what threatened her father, and her with him, receded far into the background.
Lastly, with earnest warmth, she besought him, before taking the prisoners away, to permit her to speak to the commanding general, Philippus, her father's guest, who, she was certain, was in the palace.
It was repulsive to endow this explanation of an unfortunate error with a captivating aspect by any theatrical adornment.
Even had his eyes retained the power of sight, his blood was coursing so wildly through his veins that he might perhaps have been unable to distinguish the statues around him and the thousands of spectators, who, crowded closely together, richly garlanded, their cheeks glowing with enthusiasm, surrounded the arena.
Hermon again warmly embraced Daphne, saying: "Then go!
She, too, quickly retained them, and murmured softly:
His keen ear could not deceive him, and yet a demon must be mocking him, for the voice that had called his name was the girl's of whom, in the presence of welcome death, he had thought with longing regret.
The time allowed had expired.
No one stopped them.
"Noise and dazzling radiance are hostile to the purer light, Morning and day will rise quietly from the starving sand."
Her husband, who had long trusted even the gravest secrets to his discreet old wife, had informed her of the terrible office the King had confided to him.
His uncle driven from his secure possessions to distant lands!
Daphne, of course, would accompany him.
Sometimes with touching entreaty, sometimes with imperious command, she protested, after giving him her name, that this matter could be nothing but an unfortunate mistake.
"Certainly," he answered firmly.
For the first time his lips met hers, he confessed his love, and that he had just regarded death as a deliverer; but his life was now gaining new charm through her affection.
The gray haired comrade of Alexander accompanied her, and after a few minutes both prisoners were released from their fetters.
Nothing can cloud what these brief moments have bestowed.
Was he to be led to the executioner's block?
He himself on the way to expose himself to the malice and mockery of the whole city!
Whatever might await him, he desired no better fate.
Early the next morning they should be examined, and, if they could clear themselves from the suspicion of belonging to the ranks of the conspirators, released.
The blood of these innocent men would be on his head if he did not listen to her representations.
On the way his heart throbbed almost to bursting.
The old commander offered no objection to her wish to accompany Hermon to prison.
He was appearing before his companions only to give truth its just due.
"I love you and have loved you always!" Daphne exclaimed tenderly.
Soon to morrow even-there will be no one in Alexandria who can accuse me of deserting my own honest aspiration, and, if the gods will only restore my sight and the ability to use my hands as a sculptor, then, girl, then-"
Many will not believe me, and even your father will perhaps consider it a disgrace to give his arm to his scorned, calumniated nephew to guide him home.
But only wait, wait!
The Egyptian obeyed, and his master crossed the wide space, strewn with sand, and approached the stage which had been erected for the festal performances.
Yet no!
"It is the work of Myrtilus."
Did he still possess the right to award this noble branch to any one?
"What more is needed?"
Not a sound, if you value your lives!"
Only his heart grew heavy at the thought of leaving Daphne to the tireless wooer Philotas or some other-everything else from which it is usually hard to part seemed like a burden that we gladly cast aside.
What pleasure had life to offer him, the blind man, who was already dead to his art?
It seems nevertheless as if I ought to rejoice, for you and your art have not spoken to me even a single moment from this much lauded work."
The atrium, usually swarming with guards, servants, and officials until a far later hour, was completely deserted when the blind man hurried through it with his friend.
Wherever the beloved dead might be, he desired to go there also.
Honour to Myrtilus and his art, but he trusted this noble festal assemblage would pardon the unintentional deception, and aid his prayer for recovery.
Then Daphne raised her face to his, asking, "So the Demeter is the work of Myrtilus?"
We will beseech the immortals with prayers and sacrifices to restore sight to your artist eyes.
He might now have been permitted to bind forever to his life the woman who had just rescued him from the greatest danger, but the confession he must make to his fellow artists in the palaestra the following morning still sealed his lips.
After a few moments, which the blind artist used to inspire the despairing scholar with courage, the girl returned, and she did not come alone.
The lovers took leave of each other with one last kiss, and the final words of the departing girl echoed consolingly in the blind man's heart, "The more they take from you, the more closely I will cling to you."
In spite of his deep mental distress, he could have shouted aloud in his delight and gratitude.
Probably every man thought that, in the same situation, he would have done the same yet not only justice-nay, compassion-dictated showing the blind artist that they believed in and would sustain him.
Even while he believed himself to be the creator of the Demeter, he had been seriously troubled by the praise of so many critics, because it had exposed him to the suspicion of having become faithless to his art and his nature.
When he again descended to the arena new plaudits rose; but soon hisses and other signs of disapproval blended with them, which increased in strength and number when a well known critic, who had written a learned treatise concerning the relation of the Demeter to Hermon's earlier works, expressed his annoyance in a loud whistle.
To morrow you shall confess to me who treacherously directed you to this dangerous path."
CHAPTER eight.
Again he heard the beloved voice, and this time it addressed not only him, but with the utmost haste the commander of the soldiers.
Without a word of explanation, Hermon dragged his guide along in breathless haste.
Yet he was forced to advise the blind sculptor to leave Alexandria.
Grateful and moved by joyous hopes, he informed Daphne of the words of the oracle, which had imprinted themselves upon his memory.
If he had passed into annihilation, he, Hermon, wished to follow him thither, and annihilation certainly meant redemption from pain and misery.
Was it really nothing but foolish vanity that led me to the conviction that you were thinking of me also when you engraved on the ribbon the despised spider for which, however, I always felt a certain regard-with the delicate web beneath its slender legs?"
The remembrance of Arsinoe's undignified conduct at the Dionysia, and the shameful stories of her which he had heard returned to his mind.
CHAPTER seven.
Hermon replied that he had heard several make this criticism, but the priests of the goddess refused to take it into account.
Perhaps her arrival would relieve him from the discomfort which oppressed him here.
At the same time he saw Daphne rise before him in her aristocratic dignity and kindly goodness, and a smile of satisfaction hovered around his lips as he said to himself: "The spider Althea again!
Would his troubled spirit at least permit him to enjoy and enter without restraint into the play of her quick wit?
The Queen was not to appear until after the feast, when the mixing jars were filled.
What was recognition!
Yet what mattered it, even if these miserable people considered themselves deceived and pointed the finger of scorn at him?
He would frankly inform her of his fear, and her truthful nature would find the doubt that gnawed his heart as unendurable as he himself.
His errand was to invite him to a banquet which was to take place that evening at his residence in a wing of the royal palace.
Oh, if only his Myrtilus still walked among the living!
The most aristocratic was Amyntas, who stood highest of all in the Queen's favour because he had good reason to hate the other Arsinoe, the sister of the King.
All were members of the highest class of society, and their manners showed the entire freedom from restraint that existed in the Queen's immediate circle.
Hitherto the merchant had been induced, it is true, to advance large sums of money to the Queen, but the loyal devotion which he showed to her royal husband had rendered it impossible to give him even a hint of the conspiracy.
Let us hope that you will make this three leaved clover the luck promising four leaved one.
Though so loud a denial is written on your face, I persist in my conviction, and that no idle delusion ensnares me I can prove!"
The sovereign was as unaccustomed to the society of a blind artist as Hermon was to that of a queen, and both eagerly anticipated the approaching meeting.
During many a sleepless hour of the night he had once more heard the rolling of her terrible wheel.
Hermon entered his house with drooping head.
Her age!
He was transported as if by magic to the hour of his return from Pelusium; he saw himself enter Myrtilus's studio and watch his friend scratch something, he did not know what, upon the ribbon which fastened the bunch of golden grain.
The Queen might have appeared already, and it would not do to keep her waiting.
Althea profited by the advantage of being Hermon's only acquaintance here.
How indifferent you look!
Not he-Myrtilus, and he alone, was the creator of the much lauded Demeter!
The dead Myrtilus created it!"
"Had I not made it a rule to maintain absolute silence concerning everything I hear in conversation from those with whom I am closely associated-"
"Very true," Althea assented.
Time pressed.
The approval, as well as the doubts, which it aroused in others strengthened his opinion, although even now he could not succeed in bringing it into harmony with the facts.
It was-nay, it could have been nothing else-that very spider.
But I tell you"--her deep blue eyes flashed as she spoke-"that so long as you were still a genuine creating artist the case was different. Even while putting the last touches of the file to the Demeter, for which Archias's devout daughter posed as your model, another whom you could not banish from your mind filled your imagination.
Hermon listened to the pair in silence.
When Hermon entered the residence of the grammateus in the palace, the guests had already assembled.
Crates had really been invited in order to win him over to the Queen's cause; but charming fair haired Nico had been commissioned by the conspirators to persuade him to sing Arsinoe's praises among his professional associates.
How the exchange had occurred he could not now understand, but to disbelieve that it had taken place would have been madness or self deception.
Since his return from the oracle, the fear that the rescued Demeter might yet be the work of Myrtilus had again mastered him.
The grammateus alluded to this, and most positively insisted that he could not release him; for he came not only by his own wish, but in obedience to the command of Queen Arsinoe, who desired to tell the creator of the Demeter how highly she esteemed his work and his art.
Crates, bewildered and prepared for the worst, obeyed his wish; but Althea and the other guests left behind felt more and more impressed by the suddenly awakened conviction that the hapless blind man had now also become the victim of madness.
However loudly outward circumstances might oppose this, he now felt, with a certainty which surprised him, that this work was not his own.
She perceived this with annoyance and perplexity.
Eternal gods!
So the artist found himself obliged to relinquish his opposition.
She will make our poor Queen suffer unless real friends guard her from the worst.
She would appear herself at dessert, and the banquet must therefore begin at an unusually early hour.
The artist was surprised to find this man in such a circle, but he learned from Althea that the young member of the Museum was a relative of Proclus, and a suitor of the beautiful Nico, one of the Queen's ladies in waiting, who was among the guests.
The banquet was to begin in a few hours, yet he could not let the day pass without seeing Daphne and telling her the words of the oracle.
Better people would thereby be robbed of the right to accuse him of faithlessness to himself.
The royal lady had inquired about him and his sufferings with almost sisterly interest, and Althea eagerly confirmed the statement.
How bewildered you look!
"But we are in Egypt, where marriages between brothers and sisters are pleasing to gods and men; and besides, we make our own moral laws here.
"The King's sister-the object of his love?" cried Hermon incredulously. "She must be forty years old now."
But, in spite of my blindness, I will be caught neither in her net nor in the Queen's.
What was applause!
Not the smallest detail of a work produced by the hand of a valued friend escapes my notice, and I perceived it before the Demeter came to the temple and the lofty pedestal.
Many things are forgotten after long months have passed, but it will be easy for me to sharpen your memory.
Only let me get out of doors into the open air!"
He, Proclus, was to have the high honour of including the royal lady among his guests solely on Hermon's account, and his refusal would be an insult to the Queen.
But Hermon was not in the mood to share a joyous revel, and he frankly said so, although immediately after his return he had accepted the invitation to the festival which the whole fellowship of artists would give the following day in honour of the seventieth birthday of the old sculptor Euphranor.
True, an interesting conversation still had power to charm him, but often during its continuance the full consciousness of his misfortune forced itself upon his mind; for the majority of the subjects discussed by the artists came to them through the medium of sight, and referred to new creations of architecture, sculpture, and painting, from whose enjoyment his blindness debarred him.
A stranger, out of his own sphere, he felt chilled among these closely united men and women, to whom no tie bound him save the presence of the same host.
Only, even though love has wholly disappeared, she still claims consideration, and Althea did not wish to lose Hermon's regard.
"That is going too far," replied Hermon.
This conviction raised a hundred pound weight from his soul.
Hitherto Hermon had listened to every word in silence, labouring for breath.
Then he went directly to the neighbouring palace.
How totally different, in spite of his lost vision, would his life have been!
Yet it was difficult for Hermon to turn a bright face toward his companion.
A woman who yearns for the regard of all men, and makes love a toy, easily lessens the demands she imposes upon individuals.
Here he hesitated, for, like a blow from an invisible hand, the thought darted through his mind that perhaps, on the morrow, he would see himself compelled before the whole world to cast aside the crown of fame which he owed to the statue on the lofty pedestal.
This they agreed to do on condition that she put the torch to her house at daybreak.
From Harrisonville she went to Waverly, where she was hounded continually.
These young women were thrown into an old rickety, two story house, located between fourteenth and fifteenth streets on Grand avenue, kansas city missouri.
The railroads had not reached Jackson county, and wild game was plentiful on my father's farm on Big Creek near Lee's Summit.
A daughter, Kate, who was asleep upstairs, was rescued from the flames by her sister.
When I was taken prisoner, I expected to be shot without ceremony.
When my father returned from Washington and learned of these outrages he went to kansas city missouri., headquarters of the State Militia, to see if anything could be done.
All this was cruelty, indeed, and enough to harden and embitter the softest of hearts, but it was mild compared with the continuous suffering and torture imposed upon my mother during the years from eighteen sixty two to eighteen seventy.
This was before the conflicts and troubles centered on our home that planted a bitterness in my young heart which cried out for revenge and this feeling was only accentuated by the cruelties of war which followed.
One of the numerous books purporting to be a history of my life states with the utmost soberness that, as a boy, I was cruel to dumb animals and to my schoolmates, and, as for my teachers, to them I was a continual trouble and annoyance.
His horse was tied to a tree and his body left lying where it fell.
mrs Washington Wells and her son, Samuel, on the road home from Kansas City to Lee's Summit, recognized the body as that of my father.
One of the conditions upon which her life was spared was that she would report at Lexington weekly.
I refer in particular to the shameful and cowardly murder of my father for money which he was known to have in his possession, and the cruel treatment of my mother at the hands of the Missouri Militia.
While in Washington attending to some business regarding this matter, a raid was made by the Kansas Jayhawkers upon the livery stable and stage line for several miles out into the country, the robbers also looting his store and destroying his property generally.
I went home one night to get medicine for the boys wounded in the battle of Lone Jack whom I was nursing in the woods some miles away.
There was soon the dreaded cry, "the militia are surrounding the house," and in the excitement which followed, "Suse" dashed open the door to find a score of bayonets in her face.
It was born in the blood.
Nothing could have proved her faithfulness more effectually than an incident connected with one of my stolen visits home.
My people had always been prominent, politically.
"Quantrell sometimes spares, but Anderson never," became a tradition of the Kansas line.
My father was in the employ of the United States government and had the mail contract for five hundred miles.
One of my old school teachers, whom I have never seen since the spring or summer of eighteen sixty two, is Stephen b Elkins, senator from West Virginia.
A hundred of my friends and schoolmates will bear me out in the statement that, far from being cruel to either dumb animals or human beings, I was always regarded as kind and considerate to both.
The Youngers came from Strasburg, and helped to rule there when it was a free city. Henry Washington Younger, my father, represented Jackson county three times in the legislature, and was also judge of the county court.
As soon as I saw Cole Younger I felt a sense of relief because I had known him and his parents long and favorably, and as soon as I got a chance I told him frankly what I feared and that I hoped he would manage to take care of me and save me from being killed.
In september eighteen sixty three, soldiers ransacked the Harris home, stole everything they considered valuable, and burned the house.
But this garden spot was destined to be a bloody battle ground when the nation divided.
Mother was descended from the Sullivans, Ladens and Percivals of South Carolina, the Taylors of Virginia and the Fristoes of Tennessee, and my grandfather Fristoe was a grand nephew of Chief Justice john Marshall of Virginia.
Among the women who lost their lives was Miss Josephine Anderson, whose cruel death simply blighted her brother's life and so filled him with determination to revenge that he afterward became the most desperate of desperate men.
His home was friendly to every Confederate soldier and scout in the West. Information, newspapers, and the like, left there, were certain to be kept for the right hands.
mrs McCorkle jumped from the window of the house and escaped.
He had started back to Harrisonville in a buggy, but was waylaid one mile south of Westport, a suburb of Kansas City, and brutally murdered; falling out of his buggy into the road with three mortal bullet wounds.
My brother james was born january fifteenth eighteen forty eight, john in eighteen fifty one, and Robert in December, eighteen fifty three.
On reaching the camp the first person I saw whom I knew was Cole Younger.
Walley afterwards caused the arrest of my cousins fearing that they had recognized him and his men.
These hatreds were soon to make trouble for me of which I had never dreamed.
It was noted that the groceryman had moved his stock of groceries from the building in time to save it from ruin, showing that the wrecking of the house was planned in cold blood, with the murder of my sisters and cousins and the other unfortunate women in mind.
I cannot remember when I did not know how to shoot.
Mine was a happy childhood.
Walley and his gang of the Missouri Militia, whose hands are stained with the blood of my father.
Two months after this incident the same persecutors again entered our home in the dead of the night, and, at the point of a pistol, tried to force my mother to set fire to her own home.
My eldest brother, Richard, died in eighteen sixty.
I have always felt that the exposure to which she was subjected on this cruel journey, too hard even for a man to take, was the direct cause of her death.
After the murder of my father she was so annoyed at her home in Harrisonville that she sought peace at her country residence eight and a half miles north of town.
Anderson was then ripe for the raid on Lawrence.
As I sat talking with my mother two of my brothers watched at the windows.
The down stairs was used as a grocery store.
This occurred just before I entered the Union army, and it was generally known, and I am sure Cole knew, that I was strongly for the Union and about to enter the army.
Why don't you call on Cole Younger now?"
As the raiders left, one of them shouted:
Twenty five other women were also prisoners there at that time, including three of my own sisters.
Before he died in a skirmish with Northern troops in eighteen sixty four, he had tied fifty three knots in a silken cord which he carried in his buckskin pouch.
Every knot represented a human life.
A Virginian by birth, and a school teacher for many years in various parts of Missouri, he was well known throughout the state as an active sympathizer with the South.
My father owned slaves and his children were reared in ease, though the border did not then abound in what would now be called luxury.
After six months of living death in this trap, the house was secretly undermined and fell with the prisoners, only five of whom escaped injury or death.
Naturally we were Southerners in sympathy and in fact.
The Younger brothers maintained a good reputation in the community where they lived and were well esteemed, as were their parents, for their good conduct and character.
BOYHOOD DAYS
They were good people and among the pioneers on the western border of Missouri.
He assured me he would do all he could to protect me. Cole Younger told Quantrell that my father and brother were in the rebel army and were good fighters, and that I had stayed at home to take care of my mother; that I was a good fellow and a non combatant.
Tuesday night we were at Cordova, a little village in Le Sueur county, and Wednesday night in Millersburg, eleven miles west of Northfield.
At last the boys who had been in the bank came out.
Bob, however, did not see Wheeler, who was upstairs in the hotel behind him, and Wheeler's third shot shattered Bob's right elbow as he stood beneath the stairs.
"Pitts then ran to the vault and stepped inside, whereupon Heywood followed him and tried to shut him in."
Then he told me they had been drinking and had made a botch of it inside the bank.
"What kept you so long?" I asked Pitts.
I told Pitts to put him up with me, and I would pack him out, but when we lifted him I saw he was dead, and I told Pitts to lay him down again.
When we came up I told Miller to shut the bank door, which they had left open in their hurry.
While Pitts and I were waiting for Bob and Chadwell we scouted about, going to Madelia and as far as the eastern part of Cotton wood county, to familiarize ourselves with the country.
Every time I saw any one with a bead on me I would drop off my horse and try to drive the shooter inside, but I could not see in every direction.
Bob ran down the street toward Manning, who hurried into Lee and Hitchcock's store, hoping in that way to get a shot at Bob from behind.
I stayed there pointing my pistol at any one who showed his head until Pitts had gone perhaps thirty or forty yards, and then, putting spurs to my horse, I galloped to where he was and took him up behind me.
While we were planning the raid it was intended that I should be one of the party to go into the bank.
The shutters were closed, and this caused Bunker an instant's delay that was almost fatal.
governor John s Pillsbury first offered one thousand dollars reward for the arrest of the six who had escaped, and this he changed afterward to one thousand dollars for each of them, dead or alive.
"What if they begin shooting at us?" some one suggested.
We had no time to wreck the telegraph office, and the alarm was soon sent throughout the country.
j s Allen, whose hardware store was near, tried to go into the bank, but Miller ordered him away, and he ran around the corner, shouting:
I do not believe they killed any one, however.
Finally, a few days later, the boys joined us, having bought their horses at Mankato.
The first one missed him, but the second went through his right shoulder.
"Get your guns, boys; they're robbing the bank."
Bunker tried to get a pistol that lay near him, but Pitts saw his movement and beat him to it.
"Well," said Bob, "if Cap is so particular about the shooting, suppose we let him stay outside and take his chances."
"With a flourish of his revolver one of the robbers pointed to Joseph l Heywood, head bookkeeper, who was acting as cashier in the absence of that official, and asked:"
As to the rest of the affair inside the bank I take the account of a Northfield narrator:
The hotel was full of lawyers, and they, with the judge and other court attendants, had a high old time that night.
Instead of carrying out the plan originally formed, seizing the cashier at his window and getting to the safe without interruption, they leaped right over the counter and scared Heywood at the very start.
There were no saddle horses in evidence, and we calculated that we would have a considerable advantage.
If any of our party shot him it must have been Woods.
Miller was lying in the street, but we thought him still alive.
A man named Elias Stacy, armed with a shot gun, fired at Miller just as he was mounting his horse, filling Clell's face full of bird shot.
But between the time we broke camp and the time they reached the bridge the three who went ahead drank a quart of whisky, and there was the initial blunder at Northfield.
I called to the boys in the bank to come out, for I could not imagine what was keeping them so long.
I dismounted in the street, pretending to tighten my saddle girth.
I have always believed that the man Nicholas Gustavson, who was shot in the street, and who, it was said, did not go inside because he did not understand English, was hit by a glancing shot from Manning's or Wheeler's rifle.
" 'You are the cashier,' said the robber, turning upon Heywood, who was sitting at the cashier's desk.
THE NORTHFIELD RAID
Pitts chased him with a bullet.
" 'No,' " replied Heywood, and the same question was put to a e Bunker, teller, and Frank j Wilcox, assistant bookkeeper, each of whom made the same reply.
We reunited Thursday morning, september seventh, a little outside Northfield, west of the Cannon river.
" 'Are you the cashier?' "
We then divided into two parties and started for Northfield by somewhat different routes.
Manning took a shot at Pitts' horse, killing it, which crippled us badly. Meantime the street was getting uncomfortably hot.
We took a trip into town that forenoon, and I looked over the bank.
As the men left the bank Heywood clambered to his feet and Pitts, in his liquor, shot him through the head, inflicting the wound that killed him.
We had dinner at various places and then returned to the camp.
With his second shot Manning wounded me in the thigh, and with his third he shot Chadwell through the heart.
'Open that safe-quick or I'll blow your head off.' "
Sherman's characterization-"War is hell."
Hays in recruiting a regiment around my old home.
Several Confederates followed the young Confederate into the room, and I heard them call him Cole Younger.
My brother and I, both supposed to be mortally wounded, were in the same bed.
They did mark my clothes in one or two places, however.
Joseph o Shelby.
Accordingly I was shortly awakened to accompany him to Lone Jack, where he would personally make known the situation to the other colonels.
We want to attack Foster and beat him in the morning. He will just be a nice breakfast spell."
Soon after the Confederates returned.
About an hour after the Confederates left the field, the ranking officer who took command when I became unconscious, gathered his men together and returned to Lexington.
We were out of ammunition, and were helpless, had the fight been pressed.
I believe he still retains those qualities and would prove himself as good a citizen as we have among us if set free, and would fight for the Stars and Stripes as fearlessly as he did for the Southern flag. I have never seen him since the battle of Lone Jack.
Quantrell was not in the fight at Lone Jack at all, but Jarrette and Gregg did come up with some of Quantrell's men just at the end and were in the chase back toward Lexington.
Hays had encamped after Independence.
I know much of the conditions and circumstances under which the Youngers were placed after the war, and knowing this, I have great sympathy for them.
At the same time he was obtaining from the Chicago and saint Louis papers and other sources, information about the northern armies, which was conveyed by couriers to Confederate officers in the south, and he kept concealed along the Missouri river skiffs and ferry boats to enable the Confederate officers, recruiting north of the river, to have free access to the south.
Jackman, with a party of thirty seasoned men, charged the Indiana guns, and captured them, but Major Foster led a gallant charge against the invaders, and recaptured the pieces.
On the way back he asked me what I thought about Foster being a "breakfast spell."
Cockrell (in command of the Confederate forces) and stated the case to him.
Riding to the still house where we had left the wagon munitions we had taken a few days before at Independence, I obtained a fresh supply and started for the action on the gallop.
Hays and I arrived, had his men drawn up in line of battle, while the officers were holding a council in his quarters.
"No, Lieutenant, I'll go, too."
About nine thirty a m, I was shot down.
"During the progress of the fight my attention was called to a young Confederate riding in front of the Confederate line, distributing ammunition to the men from what seemed to be a 'splint basket.' He rode along under a most galling fire from our side the entire length of the Confederate lines, and when he had at last disappeared, our boys recognized his gallantry in ringing cheers.
LONE JACK
Major Foster, in a letter to Judge George m Bennett of Minneapolis, said:
The wounded of both forces were gathered up and were placed in houses.
Cockrell.
He was personally known to me and had been my enemy from before the war.
He also called the young man Cole Younger and directed him to guard the house, which he did.
He said he and his men had just shot a lieutenant of a Cass county company whom they found wounded and that he would shoot me and my brother.
The first man who entered my room was a guerrilla, followed by a dozen or more men who seemed to obey him.
"He might be all right for dinner."
Gideon w Thompson.
Jim and john were at home at Lee's Summit.
This was the day the gate was robbed at Kansas City.
I went through Independence and from there to Ace Webb's.
Poor john, he has been hunted down and shot like a wild beast, and never was a boy more innocent.
This can be proved by both of them; also by Sheriff Barkley and fifty other respectable men of that county.
At the time of the Gallatin bank robbery I was gathering cattle in Ellis county texas; cattle that I bought from Pleas Taylor and Rector.
There were fifty or a hundred persons there who will testify in any court that john and I were there.
He was not at home, but the family will remember that we were there.
I met several of my friends.
As there was no other robbery committed until January, I will come to that time.
About the last of December, eighteen seventy three, I arrived in Carroll parish, Louisiana.
Brother john was with me.
On reading since my release the pretended history of my life I find that I was wrong in stating that there was no robbery during the summer of eighteen seventy two, the bank at Columbia, kentucky., having been raided april twenty ninth of that year.
Although every book purporting to narrate the lives of the Younger brothers has told of the Liberty robbery, and implied that we had a part in it, the Youngers were not suspected at that time, nor for a long time afterward.
THOMAS COLEMAN YOUNGER
november fifteenth eighteen seventy four, I wrote a letter to my brother in law, Lycargus a Jones, which was published in part in the Pleasant Hill Review november twenty sixth, the editor having in the meantime inquired into the statements of facts and satisfied himself of their truth.
I will give you this outline and sketch of my whereabouts and actions at the time of certain robberies with which I am charged.
Among them was Bob Hudspeth.
Ray.
Next day john and I went to Kansas City.
There I took dinner and then went to dr l w Twyman's.
We crossed the river at Blue Mills and went up on the other side.
The parts of this letter now relevant are as follows:
Jailer Griffin and his fifteen-year old son were killed there. Warrants were issued for a number of the old guerrillas, including Allen Parmer, afterward the husband of Susie james, although he was working in Kansas City at the time, and proved an absolute alibi.
dr l Lewis was his physician.
I knew a c McCoy during the war, but have never seen him since, notwithstanding the Appleton City paper says he has been with us in that county for two years.
Stayed there until after supper, then went to Silas Hudspeth's and stayed all night.
We were not on good terms at the time, nor have we been for several years.
Dickerson's, near Floyd.
This raid was accompanied by bloodshed, Judge McLain, the banker, being shot, though not fatally.
It was charged that Arthur McCoy or a c McCoy and myself had been participants in the Gad's Hill affair and the two stage robberies.
And as for a c McCoy, john never saw him in his life.
john hadn't seen either of them for eighteen months before his death.
From that time on mine and John's names have been connected with the james brothers.
Our business there was to see e p West.
Where he got his authority I don't know, but one thing I do know, he had none from me.
You may use this letter in your own way.
The gate at the fair grounds was robbed that fall.
Ridge's.
The romancers have connected Jim and me with that, when as a matter of fact I was in Louisiana, Jim and Bob were at Dallas, and john was in California.
It was immediately following the Rock Island robbery at Adair, Iowa, that there first appeared a deliberate enlistment of some local papers in Missouri to connect us with this robbery.
During the time the Shreveport stage and the Hot Springs stage were robbed; also the Gad's Hill robbery.
Jim White and j f Edmunson were arrested in saint Joseph, but were promptly released, their preliminary examination failing to connect them with the raid in any way.
I was in Jackson county at the time.
I stayed there until the eighth of February, eighteen seventy four.
We crossed on the bridge, stayed in the city all night and the next morning we rode up through the city.
LAURELS UNSOUGHT
I left r p Rose's that morning, went down the Independence road, stopped at dr Noland's, and got some pills.
But they soon after got close enough so that one of them broke my walking stick with a shot.
"Pitts," I said, "if you want to go out and surrender, go on."
Bob's shattered elbow was requiring frequent attention, and that night we made only nine miles, and Monday, Monday night and Tuesday we spent in a deserted farm house close to Mankato.
w w Murphy, col
On the prairie our maps were all right, but when we got into the big woods and among the lakes we were practically lost.
Some of the boys wanted to kill him, on the theory that "dead men tell no tales," while others urged binding him and leaving him in the woods.
We were at bay on the open prairie, surrounded by a picket line of forty men, some of whom would fight.
"They're all down but me.
Not prepared to stand for our last fight against such odds on the open field, we fell back into the Watonwan river bottoms and took refuge in some bushes.
"Coward!"
Sheriff Glispin, of Watonwan county, who was taking Bob's pistol from him, was also shouting to the fellow:
That day a man named Dunning discovered us and we took him prisoner.
A bullet had pierced Bob's right lung, but he was the only one left on his feet.
We had been living on scant rations, corn, watermelon and other vegetables principally, but in spite of this Bob's arm was mending somewhat.
We were in a strange country.
But the only mob that came was the mob of sightseers, reporters and detectives.
They came up with us as we were fording a small slough, and unable to ford it with their horses, they were delayed somewhat by having to go around it.
He had to sleep with it pillowed on my breast, Jim being also crippled with a wound in his shoulder, and we could not get much sleep.
"I can die as well as you can."
Sheriff Glispin swore we would never be mobbed as long as we were his prisoners.
We passed Dundas on the run, before the news of the robbery had reached there, and at Millersburg, too, we were in advance of the news, but at Shieldsville we were behind it.
One of the fellows in the outer line, not brave enough himself to join the volunteers who had come in to beat us out, was not disposed to believe in the surrender, and had his gun levelled on Bob in spite of the handkerchief which was waving as a flag of truce.
We did not permit them to get their weapons until we had watered our horses and got a fresh start.
I'll not shoot."
"If they do come, and I weaken," he said, "you can have your pistols."
Meanwhile we were planning, too.
They overtook us about four miles west of Shieldsville, and shots were exchanged without effect on either side.
Here a squad of men, who, we afterwards learned, were from Faribault, had left their guns outside a house.
Meantime our pursuers were watching for horsemen, not finding our abandoned horses, it seems, until Monday or Tuesday.
A CHASE TO THE DEATH
That night it started to rain, and we wore out our horses.
Come on.
No sooner, however, was he released than he made posthaste into Mankato to announce our presence, and in a few minutes another posse was looking for us.
We were taken to his hotel and a guard posted.
"I surrender," he had shouted.
Vought, of the Flanders house, a damaging suggestion which proved the ultimate undoing of our party.
"Make for the horses," I said.
His right arm useless, and his pistol empty, he had no choice.
There is no use stopping to pick up a comrade here, for we can't get him through the line. Just charge them and make it if we can."
At every stopping place we left marks of blood from our wounds, and could have been easily trailed had not the pursuers been led in the track of our recent companions.
The wound in my thigh was troubling me and I had to walk with a cane I cut in the brush. One place we got a chicken and cooked it, only to be interrupted before we could have our feast, having to make a quick dash for cover.
We were prepared to wait as long as they would, but they were not of the waiting kind.
Six stepped to the front, Sheriff Glispin, col
Suspecting, however, that he would do so, we were soon on the move, and that night we evaded the guard at the Blue Earth river bridge, and about midnight made our way through Mankato.
"Every man for himself.
"I'll not go," he replied, game to the last.
t l Vought, b m Rice, g a Bradford, c a Pomeroy and s j Severson.
The whistle on the oil mill blew, and we feared that it was a signal that had been agreed upon to alarm the town in case we were observed, but we were not molested.
A spent bullet did hit me on the "crazy bone," and as I was leading Bob's horse it caused a little excitement for a minute, but that was all.
Howard and Woods, who had favored killing Dunning, and who felt we were losing valuable time because of Bob's wound, left us that night and went west.
"Don't shoot him or I'll shoot you."
Finally we administered to him an oath not to betray our whereabouts until we had time to make our escape, and he agreed not to.
Then came the talk of mob vengeance we had heard so often in Missouri.
Saturday morning we left our horses and started through on foot, hiding that day on an island in a swamp.
And Sheriff Glispin's order not to shoot was the beginning of the protectorate that Minnesota people established over us.
All of us but Bob had gone down at the first fire.
Forming in line four paces apart, he ordered them to advance rapidly and concentrate the fire of the whole line the instant the robbers were discovered.
A little way out of Northfield we met a farmer and borrowed one of his horses for Pitts to ride.
Next day he rose and prayed the dawn prayer and repaired to his namesake's house where, after the company was all assembled, the host began to relate
Lastly I lashed a piece of wood on either side, to serve me as oars; and launched it, and embarking, did according to the saying of the poet,
Then he bestowed on me great riches from his treasuries and charged me with a magnificent present for the Caliph Harun al Rashid.
Then I loaded it with the goods, precious ores and jewels: and the union pearls which were like gravel and the best of the ambergris crude and pure, together with what I had collected on the island and what was left me of victual and wild herbs.
One day, the King himself asked me of the fashions and form of government of my country, and I acquainted him with the circumstance of the Caliph's sway in the city of Baghdad and the justice of his rule.
So we besought the Almighty and called for succour upon His Apostle (on whom be blessing and peace!), when suddenly a violent squall of wind arose and smote the ship, which rose out of the water and settled upon a great reef, the haunt of sea monsters, where it broke up and fell asunder into planks and all and everything on board were plunged into the sea.
When they saw I understood them not and made them no answer, one of them came forward and said to me in Arabic, "Peace be with thee, O my brother!
For state processions a throne is set for him upon a huge elephant, eleven cubits high: and upon this he sitteth having his great lords and officers and guests standing in two ranks, on his right hand and on his left.
We sailed with a fair wind, committing ourselves to the care of Allah (be He extolled and exalted!) and by His permission arrived at Bassorah, where I passed a few days and nights equipping myself and packing up my bales.
Moreover he gave me a sealed letter, saying, "Carry this with thine own hand to the Commander of the Faithful and give him many salutations from us!" "Hearing and obedience," I replied.
When it was the Five Hundred and Sixty second Night,
So we covered the bales with our cloaks and garments and drugget and canvas, lest they be spoiled by the rain, and betook ourselves to prayer and supplication to Almighty Allah and humbled ourselves before Him for deliverance from the peril that was upon us.
Then I took leave of him and of all my intimates and acquaintances in the island and embarked with the merchants aforesaid.
When it was the Five Hundred and Sixty third Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Sindbad the Seaman had related the history of what befel him in his sixth voyage, and all the company had dispersed, Sindbad the Landsman went home and slept as of wont.
As for me, I tore off all my clothes but my gown and swam a little way, till I happened upon one of the ship's planks whereto I clung and bestrode it like a horse, whilst the winds and the waters sported with me and the waves carried me up and cast me down; and I was in most piteous plight for fear and distress and hunger and thirst.
Presently we heard a terrible great cry like the loud pealing thunder, whereat we were terror struck and became as dead men, giving ourselves up for lost.
When it was the Five Hundred and Sixty first Night,
So I consorted with the chief of the islanders, and they paid me the utmost respect.
My boat raft drifted with the stream, I pondering the issue of my affair; and the drifting ceased not till I came to the place where it disappeared beneath the mountain.
Then he conferred on me exceeding great favours, and I repaired to my quarter and entered my home, where I warehoused all my goods and possessions. Presently, my friends came to me and I distributed presents among my family and gave alms and largesse; after which I yielded myself to joyance and enjoyment, mirth and merry making, and forgot all that I had suffered.
Who are ye and what country is this?" "O my brother," answered he, "we are husbandmen and tillers of the soil, who came out to water our fields and plantations; and, finding thee asleep on this raft, laid hold of it and made it fast by us, against thou shouldst awake at thy leisure.
The Seventh Voyage of Sindbad the Seaman.
But I was delighted at my escape from the river.
"Can you write?"
"Tired?" asked mr Beale presently.
"What's up, matey?
"Dickie Harding."
"I got to stick it," said Dickie sadly.
But big!
And this is the prettiest place ever I see.
He took his clay pipe out of his mouth to say-
"I got a pencil-hold on a bit." He took out of his pocket a new envelope, a new sheet of paper, and a new pencil ready sharpened by machinery.
Dear Sir.
"Mind you," said the man carefully, "this ain't no kidnapping.
I say, you are good!
It was the first time in his life that he really enjoyed being clean.
I lay you'll get some color in them cheeks o' yours.
They could put a man away for less than that."
"You must go on trying to improve your mind," said the pawnbroker fussily.
"Well, there.
They comes down 'andsomer if there's a nipper.
"Don't mind if I do," said Dickie.
Ever seed the sea?"
Dickie turned a little paler and said, "Why police?
And the people shoving and crushing to get off the steamer laughed when he said it.
I always like a wash meself.
"It's this 'ere nasty boot as makes me tired," said Dickie.
"Now write what I say: 'mr
Is it a bargain?"
At last he said, "You're a sharp lad, you are-bloomin' sharp.
When it was over the man asked Dickie if he could walk a little way, and when Dickie said he could they set out in the most friendly way side by side.
Come, now.
A real live bird.
A bird paused in its flight on a branch quite close and clung there swaying.
Dickie explained.
"It's very kind of you," said Dickie, "but what call you got to do it? It'll cost a lot-my victuals, I mean.
"And come back and see me-say next month."
Why, it's hours and hours since you and me got acquainted.
"Get it wrote down, then.
"I do like you."
"Like to?"
I believe you!" said the man.
Not a moment too soon.
"I'd go out and see the world a bit, I would."
Thank you, thank you-I will come back next month, and tell you everything I have learned from the Perru Sal of your books."
Dickie left the shop without his moonflowers, indeed, but with his Tinkler now whitely shining, and declared to be "real silver, and mind you take care of it, my lad," his white cornelian seal carefully packed in a strong little cardboard box with metal corners.
"Now we're square," he said.
mr Beale looked at him through the deepening twilight-rather queerly, Dickie thought.
He was very pleased with himself for having been so kind.
"No," said Dickie.
Look! the sun's just going."
In the hospital you were almost too clean; and you didn't do it yourself.
Dickie thought of the kitchen at home, the lamp that smoked, the dirty table, the fender full of ashes and dirty paper, the dry bread that tasted of mice, and the water out of the broken earthenware cup.
That would be his breakfast, when he had gone to bed crying after his aunt had slapped him.
It was, over trees more beautiful than anything Dickie had ever seen, for they were now in a country road, with green hedges and green grass growing beside it, in which little round faced flowers grew-daisies they were-even Dickie knew that.
I want company.
It was a very long time indeed before he came back.
"You 'ave that," said Dickie.
"Here we are!" said the man.
Some blokes don't, but I do."
"Come along down, can't you?
"He Reward the Wake, the last of the English, and I wunnered what it stood for."
You can keep to the grass."
What you say?
"I see that there in a book," said Dickie, charmed.
There was a loose board in his room, where the man "saw to" the gas.
"Well, you come alonger me.
"Why, only last month a brute of a dog bit me in the leg, at a back door Sutton way.
I'm glad I wasn't born a table to be wrote on.
And don't you forget you're my nipper, and you got to call me daddy."
T'other too if you like.
"Now," said the man, "you take an' write-make it flat agin the sole of me boot." He lay face downward on the road and turned up his boot, as though boots were the most natural writing desks in the world.
"I will," said Dickie.
"I know you will," said Dickie, with enthusiasm.
"Just a tiddy bit, p'raps," said Dickie bravely, "but I can stick it."
Some blokes think it pays to be dirty.
It almost looked, Dickie thought, as though he had brought them out for some special purpose.
"And-here we are," said mr Beale, stopping in a side street at an open door from which yellow light streamed welcomingly.
Ever been on the boat?"
"Yes," said Dickie, "if I got a pen."
"All the way, pretty near," said the man.
"So you shall," said mr Beale; "a reg'ler wash all over-this very night.
To the people who live in Rosemary Terrace the words "police court" are very alarming indeed.
"Bless me!" said mr Beale uncomfortably.
That made all the difference.
"Is this Deptford?" Dickie asked.
"What-me?" said Dickie.
I should think so!"
He looked about him, and knew that he did not at all know where he was. There was a tall, thin, ragged man lounging against a stable door in the yard where the Punch and Judy show lived.
"I'd best be getting home."
He longed to see it unpack itself and display its wonders, and he followed it through more streets than he knew; and when he found that it was not going to unpack at all, but was just going home to its bed in an old coach house, he remembered the fire wood; and the halfpenny clutched tight and close in his hand seemed to reproach him warmly.
"A thousand blessings from a grateful heart.
The sun shot long golden beams through the gaps in the hedge.
And don't you forget it."
"'Ave you been asleep?
"Is it country where you going?" said Dickie, looking at the green hedge.
Take it or leave it."
The wind blew freshly, and the ragged man found a sheltered corner behind the funnel.
"I like it very much, and thank you kindly," said Dickie presently.
"Oh, yes."
But-"We'll be beggars, you mean?" he said doubtfully.
"Not exackly," said the man, "but it's all right.
So now I make you a fair offer.
"No," said Dickie.
Dickie felt that this was true.
It was so sheltered, and the wind had been so strong that Dickie felt sleepy.
Tramping alone ain't no beano to me.
I will come back.
Also he sighed heavily.
What call you got to do it?"
Only I calls her that."
Fried eggs and bacon-he had one egg and the man had three-bread and butter-and if the bread was thick, so was the butter-and as many cups of tea as you liked to say thank you for.
He had never seen one before, and it interested him extremely.
"She any good?"
He rolled over, took the paper and read it slowly and with difficulty. Then he folded it and put it in his pocket.
"Why not?
"Oh, no-no, I never."
I shall catch it a fair treat as it is.
Dickie always remembered that moment.
"Mother?"
What do you say, matey?"
"I'm going that way myself," said the man, getting away from the wall. "We'll go back by the boat if you like.
Then he looked up at the sky and then down at the road-they were resting on a heap of stones.
Also a broken backed copy of "Ingoldsby Legends" and one of "mrs Markham's English History," which had no back at all.
Its pavements were of red brick and its houses of white stone, and its bow windows and balconies were green, and Dickie thought it was the prettiest town in the world.
mr Beale looked down at the touch.
Gets 'is own meals and larks about on 'is own."
"How beautiful!" said Dickie, wriggling with delight.
Then, "Does it hurt you-walking?"
By evening they had seven and sixpence.
"It's better'n Fiff of November," said Dickie; "and I do like you.
"Yes, course they must 'ave, come to think of it.
"See that bloke just now?" said mr Beale.
mr Beale laughed.
"Yes, isn't he, mother?" said the little girl.
Remember that neither of them knew any better.
And Dickie for the first time slept out of doors.
Only howls and rats lives in ruins."
"That's all you know!
And to 'ear the way 'e does the patter to me on the road.
"It's got loose," said Dickie, trying to scramble out of the perambulator; "let's catch 'im and take 'im along."
Have you ever slept out of doors?
"I'd like to be a rabbit."
It was a wonderful day.
She died in the infirmary.
Dickie, quick to imitate, touched his.
"Poor little man!" said the lady; "you miss your mother, don't you?"
Might a passed 'im in a crowd-see?"
mr Beale went more and more slowly, and as the lady and the little girl drew near he stopped altogether and touched his cap.
"No! Nobody don't live 'ere, mate," said mr Beale.
"You're a kind father," said the lady.
"They're only weeds," said Beale.
"I shouldn't wonder," said mr Beale indifferently.
See?
Dickie sniffed.
I never knew you took like it afore."
"It's a ruin, this is.
Then he said-
He laid in bed and heard jolly voices talking and singing in the kitchen below.
They did not stay there, but walked out across the downs, where the skylarks were singing, and on a dip of the downs came upon great stone walls and towers very strong and gray.
Couldn't get a nipper."
"But you said the bed with the green curtains," urged Dickie.
"Is it a king as lives 'ere, then?" Dickie asked.
Dickie saw, and the crown was set on his happiness.
But 'e's never let it out."
Come on, mate."
From some mysterious source mr Beale had obtained an old double perambulator, which must have been made, Dickie thought, for very fat twins, it was so broad and roomy.
"Did any one ever live in it?"
I got the plan drawed out.
"And that pillowy bundle on the seat."
A rabbit.
To the elder tramp lies and begging were natural means of livelihood.
Three months ago it was, mum.
"You much better be my little nipper," said Beale.
"What's that there?" said Dickie.
BURGLARS
"Seems to me you're a bit dotty about this 'ere extry double nipper.
"Well, p'rhaps you're right.
To the little tramp the whole thing was a new and entrancing game of make believe.
"But if you've got silver you oughtn't to be begging," said the lady, shutting up her purse.
It was not the next day, which was a Saturday, that they took the train like dukes.
Like the ones that his fancy had put in the mouldering hutch at home.
"Blessed if I ever see such a nipper," he said, over and over again.
"In you gets," he said suddenly; "you'll be fair knocked.
"Never see such a nipper for noticing, neither.
I like you nexter my own daddy and mr Baxter next door."
Hi! there goes a rabbit.
Please do not be too shocked.
"That's all right," said mr Beale awkwardly.
You can look about you just as well a sittin' down," he added, laying the crutch across the front of the perambulator.
Then he spat thoughtfully.
But you learned all that at school.
The night is full of interesting little sounds that will not, at first, let you sleep-the rustle of little wild things in the hedges, the barking of dogs in distant farms, the chirp of crickets and the croaking of frogs.
All the country sights and sounds, that you hardly notice because you have known them every year as long as you can remember, were wonderful magic to the little boy from Deptford.
'E's a wunner, and no bloomin' error.
"It's a carstle-like wot the King's got at Windsor."
"Swelp me!" he said helplessly.
Next morning, quite early, they took the road.
When Dickie came back, without mushrooms, the red whiskered man was gone.
A bit of all right, I call it!"
They went on up the hill as happy as any one need wish to be.
"Not like it did 'fore I went to the orspittle.
See him?"
"That's our clothes.
The best emetic is that which is at hand.
To avert the tendency to death, we must endeavour to palliate the symptoms and neutralize the effects of the poison.
eight.--DETECTION OF POISONS
Filter through a filter moistened with water.
Evaporate filtrate to dryness, and dissolve residue in water, the solution being made distinctly acid.
Every doctor should provide himself with an antidote case.
seven.--TREATMENT OF POISONING
The tube should be examined to see that it is not broken or cracked, as accidents have happened from neglecting this precaution.
In the case of phosphorus the condenser should be of glass, and the process of distillation conducted in the dark, so that the luminosity of the phosphorus may be noted.
The ether floats on the surface, holding the alkaloids, except morphine, in solution. (five) A part of this ethereal solution is poured into a watch glass and allowed to evaporate.
It may be given in the form of the injection of the Pharmacopoeia, or preferably as a tablet dissolved in water.
If the medical practitioner is in doubt on any point, he should obtain technical assistance from someone who has paid attention to the subject.
Notice the smell, colour, and general appearance, of the matter submitted for examination.
Tickling the fauces with a feather may excite vomiting.
The various antidotes will be mentioned under their respective poisons.
The filtrate is shaken with ether to remove fat, etc, the ether separated, the watery solution neutralized with soda, and then shaken with ether, which removes the alkaloid in a more or less impure condition.
He should make inquiries as to symptoms, and time at which food or medicine was last taken.
The dose for an adult is ten minims.
If there is a choice, give apomorphine hypodermically.
He would be unwise to do so.
In order to isolate an inorganic substance from organic matter, Fresenius's method is adopted.
In using the elastic stomach tube, some fluid should be introduced into the stomach before attempting to empty it, or a portion of the mucous membrane may be sucked into the aperture.
To purify it, add a small quantity of dilute sulphuric acid, and, after evaporating to three quarters of its bulk, add a saturated solution of carbonate of potash or soda.
The modes of treatment may be ranged under three heads: (one) To eliminate the poison; (two) to antagonize its action; (three) to avert the tendency to death.
This examination having been made, the contents of the alimentary canal, and any other substances to be examined, must be submitted to chemical processes.
The flask is heated in a water bath, and the vapours condensed by a Liebig's condenser.
In making a post mortem examination, the alimentary canal should be removed and preserved for further investigation.
A double ligature should be passed round the oesophagus, and also round the duodenum a few inches below the pylorus.
On the evaporation of the alcohol the resinous and fatty matters separate.
In the absence of a hypodermic syringe, the remedy may be given by the rectum.
In the case of narcotics and depressing agents, stimulants, electricity, and cold affusions, may be found useful.
Make a solution of the contents of the stomach or solid organs minced very fine by digesting them with acidulated alcohol or water and filtering.
He should take possession of any food, medicine, vomited matter, urine, or faeces, in the room, and should seal them up in clean vessels for examination.
The residue of the material after digestion with hydrochloric acid and potassium chlorate may have to be examined for silver, lead, and barium.
Evaporate the filtrate to a syrup, and extract with successive portions of absolute alcohol.
Absolute alcohol will then dissolve out the alkaloid, and leave it on evaporation in a crystalline form.
Treat this with excess of bisulphate of sodium, then saturate with sulphuretted hydrogen until metals are thrown down as sulphides. These may be collected and tested.
In the case of volatile substances distillation will be required.
He should notice the position and temperature of the body, the condition of rigor mortis, marks of violence, appearance of lips and mouth.
If the alkaloid is volatile, oily streaks appear on the glass; if not volatile, crystalline traces will be visible.
All observations should be at once committed to writing, or they will not be admitted by the court for the purpose of refreshing the memory whilst giving evidence.
Seeds of plants may be found.
These should all be put in separate jars without any preservative fluid, tied up, sealed, labelled, and initialled.
Separate the ethereal solution and evaporate.
The second indication is met by the administration of the appropriate antidote.
In a case of attempted suicide by poisoning, is it the duty of the doctor to inform the police?
He had much better stick to his own business, and not act as an amateur detective.
The first indication is met by the administration of emetics, to produce vomiting, or by the application of the stomach tube.
Simple filtration will sometimes suffice to separate the required substance; in other cases dialysis will be necessary, in order that crystalloid substances may be separated from colloid bodies.
The intestines may be removed in a similar way, and the whole or a portion of the liver should be preserved.
Apomorphine is not allied in physiological action to morphine, and may be given in cases of narcotic poisoning. Sulphate of zinc, salt and water, ipecacuanha, and mustard, are all useful as emetics.
The colour may indicate salts of copper, cantharides, etc
The odour may show the presence of prussic acid, alcohol, opium, or phosphorus.
We should endeavour to promote the elimination of the poison from the body by stimulating the secretions.
Antidotes may act (one) chemically, by forming harmless compounds, as lime in oxalic acid poisoning; (two) physiologically, the drug which is administered neutralizing more or less completely the poison which has been absorbed; (three) physically, as charcoal.
When the Father who begat the world saw the image which he had made of the Eternal Gods moving and living, he rejoiced; and in his joy resolved, since the archetype was eternal, to make the creature eternal as far as this was possible.
Do ye therefore make them; I will implant in them the seed of immortality, and you shall weave together the mortal and immortal, and provide food for them, and receive them again in death.' Thus he spake, and poured the remains of the elements into the cup in which he had mingled the soul of the universe.
Socrates begins the Timaeus with a summary of the Republic.
He put the moon in the orbit which was nearest to the earth, the sun in that next, the morning star and Mercury in the orbits which move opposite to the sun but with equal swiftness-this being the reason why they overtake and are overtaken by one another.
The fires from within and from without meet about the smooth and bright surface of the mirror; and because they meet in a manner contrary to the usual mode, the right and left sides of the object are transposed.
And God created them according to the patterns or species of them which existed in the divine original.
Now the Nile is our saviour from fire, and as there is little rain in Egypt, we are not harmed by water; whereas in other countries, when a deluge comes, the inhabitants are swept by the rivers into the sea.
The soul was first made by him-the elder to rule the younger; not in the order in which our wayward fancy has led us to describe them, but the soul first and afterwards the body.
And when external impressions enter in, they are really conquered, though they seem to conquer.
And God lighted a fire in the second orbit from the earth which is called the sun, to give light over the whole heaven, and to teach intelligent beings that knowledge of number which is derived from the revolution of the same.
The fire or light, when kept in by the eyelids, equalizes the inward motions, and there is rest accompanied by few dreams; only when the greater motions remain they engender in us corresponding visions of the night.
The old man brightened up at hearing this, and said: Had Solon only had the leisure which was required to complete the famous legend which he brought with him from Egypt he would have been as distinguished as Homer and Hesiod.
Of the second or concurrent causes of sight I have already spoken, and I will now speak of the higher purpose of God in giving us eyes.
The outer circle or sphere was named the sphere of the same-the inner, the sphere of the other or diverse; and the one revolved horizontally to the right, the other diagonally to the left.
By reason of these affections the soul is at first without intelligence, but as time goes on the stream of nutriment abates, and the courses of the soul regain their proper motion, and apprehend the same and the other rightly, and become rational.
Critias when he told this tale of the olden time, was ninety years old, I being not more than ten.
Two kinds of motion were assigned to them-first, the revolution in the same and around the same, in peaceful unchanging thought of the same; and to this was added a forward motion which was under the control of the same.
I will briefly describe them to you, and you shall read the account of them at your leisure in the sacred registers.
For there occurs at long intervals a derangement of the heavenly bodies, and then the earth is destroyed by fire.
All that he did was done rationally in and by himself, and he moved in a circle turning within himself, which is the most intellectual of motions; but the other six motions were wanting to him; wherefore the universe had no feet or legs.
In the likeness of what animal was the world made?--that is the third question...The form of the perfect animal was a whole, and contained all intelligible beings, and the visible animal, made after the pattern of this, included all visible creatures.
He lightly touches upon a few points,--the division of labour and distribution of the citizens into classes, the double nature and training of the guardians, the community of property and of women and children.
These swelling and surging as in a river moved irregularly and irrationally in all the six possible ways, forwards, backwards, right, left, up and down.
The body of heaven is visible, but the soul is invisible, and partakes of reason and harmony, and is the best of creations, being the work of the best.
'And what was the subject of the poem?' said the person who made the remark.
TIMAEUS: Why did the Creator make the world?...He was good, and therefore not jealous, and being free from jealousy he desired that all things should be like himself.
God gave us the faculty of sight that we might behold the order of the heavens and create a corresponding order in our own erring minds.
Are there many worlds or one only?--that is the fourth question...One only.
Having made a compound of all the three, he proceeded to divide the entire mass into portions related to one another in the ratios of one, two, three, four, nine, eight, twenty seven, and proceeded to fill up the double and triple intervals thus-
There are four of them: one of gods, another of birds, a third of fishes, and a fourth of animals.
A little while afterwards there were great earthquakes and floods, and your warrior race all sank into the earth; and the great island of Atlantis also disappeared in the sea.
The spot of earth which the goddess chose had the best of climates, and produced the wisest men; in no other was she herself, the philosopher and warrior goddess, so likely to have votaries.
Nine thousand years have elapsed since she founded yours, and eight thousand since she founded ours, as our annals record.
Vain would be the labour of telling all the figures of them, moving as in dance, and their juxta positions and approximations, and when and where and behind what other stars they appear to disappear-to tell of all this without looking at a plan of them would be labour in vain.
The sight of them and their revolutions has given us the knowledge of number and time, the power of enquiry, and philosophy, which is the great blessing of human life; not to speak of the lesser benefits which even the vulgar can appreciate.
But violent as were the internal and alimentary fluids, the tide became still more violent when the body came into contact with flaming fire, or the solid earth, or gliding waters, or the stormy wind; the motions produced by these impulses pass through the body to the soul and have the name of sensations.
Then your city did bravely, and won renown over the whole earth.
SOCRATES: Excellent, Timaeus, I like your manner of approaching the subject-proceed.
Thus arose day and night, which are the periods of the most intelligent nature; a month is created by the revolution of the moon, a year by that of the sun
The occasion of the rehearsal was the day of the Apaturia called the Registration of Youth, at which our parents gave prizes for recitation.
But in Egypt the traditions of our own and other lands are by us registered for ever in our temples.
The subject was a very noble one; he described the most famous action in which the Athenian people were ever engaged.
And as the world was composed of solids, between the elements of fire and earth God placed two other elements of air and water, and arranged them in a continuous proportion-
Although they give no proof, we must believe them as is customary.
But I would not speak at the time, because I wanted to refresh my memory. I had heard the old man when I was a child, and though I could not remember the whole of our yesterday's discourse, I was able to recall every word of this, which is branded into my mind; and I am prepared, Socrates, to rehearse to you the entire narrative.
Now he who is the best could only create the fairest; and reflecting that of visible things the intelligent is superior to the unintelligent, he put intelligence in soul and soul in body, and framed the universe to be the best and fairest work in the order of nature, and the world became a living soul through the providence of God.
That which is bound may be dissolved, but only an evil being would dissolve that which is harmonious and happy.
The memory of them was lost, because there was no written voice among you.
'I see,' replied Socrates, 'that I shall be well entertained; and do you, Timaeus, offer up a prayer and begin.'
The earth, which is our nurse, clinging around the pole extended through the universe, he made to be the guardian and artificer of night and day, first and eldest of gods that are in the interior of heaven.
But he is unable to invent such a narrative himself; and he is afraid that the poets are equally incapable; for, although he pretends to have nothing to say against them, he remarks that they are a tribe of imitators, who can only describe what they have seen.
Sight is the source of the greatest benefits to us; for if our eyes had never seen the sun, stars, and heavens, the words which we have spoken would not have been uttered.
Thus was time made in the image of the eternal nature; and it was created together with the heavens, in order that if they were dissolved, it might perish with them.
And something similar happens when the disordered motions of the soul come into contact with any external thing; they say the same or the other in a manner which is the very opposite of the truth, and they are false and foolish, and have no guiding principle in them.
Other periods of wonderful length and complexity are not observed by men in general; there is moreover a cycle or perfect year at the completion of which they all meet and coincide...To this end the stars came into being, that the created heaven might imitate the eternal nature.
And there you dwelt as became the children of the gods, excelling all men in virtue, and many famous actions are recorded of you.
Now that which is created is of necessity corporeal and visible and tangible,--visible and therefore made of fire,--tangible and therefore solid and made of earth.
For if in the original there had been more than one they would have been the parts of a third, which would have been the true pattern of the world; and therefore there is, and will ever be, but one created world.
Thus far the universal animal was made in the divine image, but the other animals were not as yet included in him.
This, however, is an after stage-at present, we are only concerned with the creation of the body and soul.
The most famous of them all was the overthrow of the island of Atlantis.
But when the visual ray goes forth into the darkness, then unlike falls upon unlike-the eye no longer sees, and we go to sleep.
And his children, receiving from him the immortal principle, borrowed from the world portions of earth, air, fire, water, hereafter to be returned, which they fastened together, not with the adamantine bonds which bound themselves, but by little invisible pegs, making each separate body out of all the elements, subject to influx and efflux, and containing the courses of the soul.
Perceiving this, and with the view of eliciting information from them, he told them the tales of Phoroneus and Niobe, and also of Deucalion and Pyrrha, and he endeavoured to count the generations which had since passed.
All these bodies became living creatures, and learnt their appointed tasks, and began to move, the nearer more swiftly, the remoter more slowly, according to the diagonal movement of the other.
The entire compound was divided by him lengthways into two parts, which he united at the centre like the letter X, and bent into an inner and outer circle or sphere, cutting one another again at a point over against the point at which they cross.
What is spoken of the unchanging or intelligible must be certain and true; but what is spoken of the created image can only be probable; being is to becoming what truth is to belief.
The two divine courses were encased by the gods in a sphere which is called the head, and is the god and lord of us.
And since this was controlled by the movement of the same, the seven planets in their courses appeared to describe spirals; and that appeared fastest which was slowest, and that which overtook others appeared to be overtaken by them.
And although you are not immortal you shall not die, for I will hold you together.
God took of the unchangeable and indivisible and also of the divisible and corporeal, and out of the two he made a third nature, essence, which was in a mean between them, and partook of the same and the other, the intractable nature of the other being compressed into the same.
And so the thought of God made a God in the image of a perfect body, having intercourse with himself and needing no other, but in every part harmonious and self-contained and truly blessed.
They were no longer pure as before, but diluted; and the mixture he distributed into souls equal in number to the stars, and assigned each to a star-then having mounted them, as in a chariot, he showed them the nature of the universe, and told them of their future birth and human lot.
The souls were to be implanted in bodies, which were in a perpetual flux, whence, he said, would arise, first, sensation; secondly, love, which is a mixture of pleasure and pain; thirdly, fear and anger, and the opposite affections: and if they conquered these, they would live righteously, but if they were conquered by them, unrighteously.
This great island lay over against the Pillars of Heracles, in extent greater than Libya and Asia put together, and was the passage to other islands and to a great ocean of which the Mediterranean sea was only the harbour; and within the Pillars the empire of Atlantis reached in Europe to Tyrrhenia and in Libya to Egypt.
When all of them, both those who show themselves in the sky, and those who retire from view, had come into being, the Creator addressed them thus:--'Gods, sons of gods, my works, if I will, are indissoluble.
This mighty power was arrayed against Egypt and Hellas and all the countries bordering on the Mediterranean.
The gods were made in the form of a circle, which is the most perfect figure and the figure of the universe. They were created chiefly of fire, that they might be bright, and were made to know and follow the best, and to be scattered over the heavens, of which they were to be the glory.
and so put together a visible and palpable heaven, having harmony and friendship in the union of the four elements; and being at unity with itself it was indissoluble except by the hand of the framer.
'In mind,' replied the priest, 'I mean to say that you are children; there is no opinion or tradition of knowledge among you which is white with age; and I will tell you why.
Hear me, then:--Three tribes of mortal beings have still to be created, but if created by me they would be like gods.
But two terms must be united by a third, which is a mean between them; and had the earth been a surface only, one mean would have sufficed, but two means are required to unite solid bodies.
The soul of him who has education is whole and perfect and escapes the worst disease, but, if a man's education be neglected, he walks lamely through life and returns good for nothing to the world below.
Wherefore he made an image of eternity which is time, having an uniform motion according to number, parted into months and days and years, and also having greater divisions of past, present, and future.
Is the world created or uncreated?--that is the first question.
They first contrived the eyes, into which they conveyed a light akin to the light of day, making it flow through the pupils.
Look!"
Look!
"I have no Heavenly Father!"
"Hush, Pearl, hush!
"Child, what art thou?" cried the mother.
Or, if not, thou strange and elfish child, whence didst thou come?"
"It is thou that must tell me!"
But look here at Carpaccio, even in my copy.
There are just four touches-fine as the finest penmanship-to do that beak; and yet you will find that in the peculiar paroquettish mumbling and nibbling action of it, and all the character in which this nibbling beak differs from the tearing beak of the eagle, it is impossible to go farther or be more precise.
But in this vignette, copied from Turner, you have the two principles brought out perfectly.
Of course, I cannot do so myself; yet in these sketches of mine, made for the sake of color, there is enough to show you the nature and the value of the method. They are two pieces of study of the color of marble architecture, the tints literally "edified," and laid edge to edge as simply on the paper as the stones are on the walls.
Some of the touches, indeed, when the tint has been mixed with much water, have been laid in little drops or ponds, so that the pigment might crystallize hard at the edge.
He knows them both.
But this peacock, being drawn with intense delight in blue, on gold, and getting character of peacock in the general sharp outline, instead of-as Rubens' peacocks-in black shadow, is distinctively Gothic of fine style.
Our uneducated men work too bluntly to be ever in the right; but the Germans draw finely and resolutely wrong.
But if you go on into the veracities of the school of Clay, you will find there is something at the roots of almond and apple trees, which is-This.
Now in this of Burne Jones, the landscape is clearly full of light everywhere, color or glass light: that is, the outline is prepared for modification of color only.
In both these high mythical subjects the surrounding nature, though suffering, is still dignified and beautiful.
So that the schools of Crystal, visionary, passionate, and fantastic in purpose, are, in method, trenchantly formal and clear; and the schools of Clay, absolutely realistic, temperate, and simple in purpose, are, in method, mysterious and soft; sometimes licentious, sometimes terrific, and always obscure.
Do not, therefore, think that the Gothic school is an easy one.
I wish you therefore to begin your study of natural history and landscape by discerning the simple outlines and the pleasant colors of things; and to rest in them as long as you can.
So that if you get once the right clue to any group of them, it will grasp the simplest, yet reach to the highest truths.
And also, Carpaccio does it with a touch, with one sweep of his brush; three minutes at the most allowed for all the beast; while Michael Angelo has been haggling at this dragon's neck for an hour.
It has no beauty whatsoever, no specialty of picturesqueness; and all its lines are cramped and poor.
The other is a mythological subject of deeper meaning, the death of Procris.
You have the white of foaming water, of buildings and clouds, brought out brilliantly from a white ground; and though part of the subject is in deep shadow the eye at once catches the one black point admitted in front.
By being studious of color they are studious of division; and while the chiaroscurist devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing-unseparated light, the colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light.
This is no longer to make us think of the death of happy souls, but of the labor of unhappy ones; at least, of the more or less limited, dullest, and-I must not say homely, but-unhomely life of the neglected agricultural poor.
In both, the vegetation, though beautiful, is absolutely wild and uncared for, as it seems, either by human or by higher powers, which, having appointed for it the laws of its being, leave it to spring into such beauty as is consistent with disease and alternate with decay.
Then he comes to the beak of it.
None of this bright Gothic art was ever done but either by faith in the attainableness of felicity in heaven, or under conditions of real order and delicate loveliness on the earth.
Every plant in the grass is set formally, grows perfectly, and may be realized completely.
And here I am able to show you, fortunately, one of his works painted at this time of his most earnest thought; when his imagination was still freshly filled with the Greek mythology, and he saw for the first time with his own eyes the clouds come down upon the actual earth.
Thus, in Chaucer's "Dream":
But there exist some exquisite, though feebler, designs in missal painting; of which, in England, the landscape and flowers in the Psalter of Henry the Sixth will serve you for a sufficient type; the landscape in the Grimani missal at Venice being monumentally typical and perfect.
Once understand that, and you will see why Turner has put her death under this deep shade of trees, the sun withdrawing his last ray; and why he has put beside her the low type of an animal's pain, a dog licking its wounded paw.
You see how doubly, how intimately, opposed the ideas are; yet how difficult to explain without apparent contradiction.
Nothing will be more precious to you, I think, in the practical study of art, than the conviction, which will force itself on you more and more every hour, of the way all things are bound together, little and great, in spirit and in matter.
You might more easily fill a house with pictures like Constable's from garret to cellar, than imitate one cluster of leaves by Van Eyck or Giotto; and among all the efforts that have been made to paint our common wild flowers, I have only once-and that in this very year, just in time to show it to you-seen the thing done rightly.
Now for your own practice in this, having first acquired the skill of exquisite delineation and laying of pure color, day by day you must draw some lovely natural form or flower or animal without obscurity-as in missal painting; choosing for study, in natural scenes, only what is beautiful and strong in life.
You must look at him in the face-fight him-conquer him with what scathe you may: you need not think to keep out of the way of him.
three.
I say, "whether color be gay or sad."
And therefore, primarily, they must be able to divide; so that elementary exercises in color must be directed, like first exercises in music, to the clear separation of notes; and the final perfections of color are those in which, of innumerable notes or hues, every one has a distinct office, and can be fastened on by the eye, and approved, as fulfilling it.
I just now referred to the landscape by john Bellini in the National Gallery as one of the six best existing of the purist school, being wholly felicitous and enjoyable.
My first and principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance, on any student who might attempt to copy them, this method of laying portions of distinct hue side by side.
Only, there are two sorts of cloud and fire.
Well, then, last, here is Turner's; Greek school of the highest class; and you define his art, absolutely, as first the displaying intensely, and with the sternest intellect, of natural form as it is, and then the envelopment of it with cloud and fire.
And one of the chief delights which any one who really enjoys painting finds in that art as distinct from sculpture is in this exquisite inlaying or joiner's work of it, the fitting of edge to edge with a manual skill precisely correspondent to the close application of crowded notes without the least slur, in fine harp or piano playing.
Again, there is not a touch of black in any shadow, however deep, of these two studies; so that, if I chose to put a piece of black near them, it would be conspicuous with a vengeance.
I fully anticipated, at the beginning of the Pre Raphaelite movement, that they would have carried forward this method of work; but they broke themselves to pieces by pursuing dramatic sensation instead of beauty.
George" of Carpaccio at Venice, are all that I can name myself of great works.
The brown ground beneath is left, for the most part; one touch of black is put for the hollow; two delicate lines of dark gray define the outer curve; and one little quivering touch of white draws the inner edge of the mandible.
But, observe, you can only do this on one condition-that of striving also to create, in reality, the beauty which you seek in imagination.
in a few moments to lose her forever.
We have no language sufficiently strong for the expression of our indignation and shame at the recent transaction in a sister state, and that state, Missouri, a state of which we had long been proud, alike for her men and history, but now so fallen that we could wish her star stricken from the bright constellation of the Union.
Was it the "Mormons?" Is it not notorious on the contrary that they were hunted like wild beasts from county to county before they made any resistance?
There their sad condition evoked for a time general commiseration.
The first well established seat of the Church was in the pretty little town of Kirtland, Ohio, almost within sight of Lake Erie; and here soon rose the first temple of modern times.
No respect was paid to age or sex; grey heads, and infant lips that scarcely had learned to lisp a word, vigorous manhood and immature youth, mother and maiden, fared alike in the scene of carnage, and their bodies were thrown into an old well.
The national executive, Andrew Jackson, while expressing sympathy for the persecuted people, deplored his lack of power to interfere with the administration or non administration of state laws; the national officials could do nothing; the state officials would do naught.
Within two years of its dedication, the temple in Kirtland was abandoned by the people, who were compelled to flee for their lives before the onslaughts of mobocrats; but a second temple, larger and more beautiful than the first, soon reared its spires in the city of Nauvoo, Illinois.
Their gathering is to be like that of the Jews at Jerusalem-a pacific one, and in their taking possession of what they regard as a land of promise, no one previously located there shall be denied his rights.
Their eyes were from the first turned in anticipation toward the evening sun-not merely that the work of proselyting should be carried on in the west, but that the headquarters of the Church should be there established.
But tools were not wanting, as indeed they never have been, for murder and its kindred outrages.
An appeal was made to the executive of the state, but little encouragement was returned.
Let us observe the contrast between the beginning and the present proportions of the Church.
American school boys read with emotions of horror of the Albigenses, driven, beaten and killed, with a papal legate directing the butchery; and of the Vaudois, hunted and hounded like beasts as the effect of a royal decree; and they yet shall read in the history of their own country of scenes as terrible as these in the exhibition of injustice and inhuman hate.
At first but a family affair, opposition to the work has involved successively the town, the county, the state, the country, and today the "Mormon" question has been accorded extended consideration at the hands of the national government, and indeed most civilized nations have taken cognizance of the same.
Have any who plundered and openly insulted the "Mormons" ever been brought to the punishment due to their crimes? Let boasting murderers of begging and helpless infancy answer!
At that time there may have been and probably were many times that number who had professed adherence to the newly restored faith; but as the requirements of the law governing the formation of religious societies were satisfied by the application of six, only the specified number formally took part. Such was the beginning of the Church, soon to be so universally maligned.
Nevertheless, the mustard seed, among the smallest of all seeds, has attained the proportions of a tree, and the birds of the air are nesting in its branches; the acorn is now an oak offering protection and the sweets of satisfaction to every earnest pilgrim journeying its way for truth.
Its origin was small-a germ, an insignificant seed, hardly to be thought of as likely to arouse opposition.
Oh, what a record to read; what a picture to gaze upon; how awful the fact! An official edict offering expatriation or death to a peaceable community with no crime proved against them, and guilty of no offense other than that of choosing to differ in opinion from the masses!
Who began the quarrel?
The awful work was carried out with dread dispatch.
What the heart of man can conceive, the hand of man will find a way to execute.
Already a North and a South were talked of-why not set up also a West?
He was a man with clear title as one of the small brotherhood we call great.
With his death closed another epoch in the history of his people, and a successor arose, one who was capable of leading and judging under the changed conditions.
And what was the cause of this hurried departure of the military? For many months, ominous rumblings had been heard,--indications of the gathering storm which was soon to break in the awful fury of civil strife.
The people contested these measures one by one in the courts; presenting in case after case the different phases of the subject, and urging the unconstitutionality of the measure.
But "Mormonism" died not; every added pang of grief served but to unite the people.
He left Utah in the early stages of the rebellion, turned his arms against the flag he had sworn to defend, doffed the blue, donned the grey, and fell a rebel on the field of Shiloh.
At last the Edmunds Tucker act took effect, making not the marriage alone but the subsequent acknowledging of the contract an offense punishable by fine or imprisonment or both.
Sad as have been the experiences of the people in consequence of this practise, deep and anguish laden as have been the sighs and groans, hot and bitter as have been the tears so caused, the heaviest persecution, the cruelest treatment of their history began before plural marriage was known in the Church.
We believe, further that contracts as of marriage, to be valid beyond the veil of mortality must be sanctioned by a power greater than that of earth.
The movement has been called not inaptly "Buchanan's blunder," but the best and wisest men may make blunders, and whatever may be said of President Buchanan's short sightedness in taking this step, even his enemies do not question his integrity in the matter.
The Latter day Saints were long regarded as a polygamous people.
At the inception of plural marriage among the Latter day Saints, there was no law, national or state, against its practise.
Changes many and great followed in bewildering succession in Utah.
But a word further concerning the expedition in general.
A supreme opportunity had come and how was it used?
The people were besought to take sides with the South in the awful scenes of cruel strife; it was openly stated in the east that Utah had allied herself with the cause of secession; and by others that the design was to make Salt Lake City the capital of an independent government.
We believe in a literal resurrection and an actual hereafter, in which future state shall be recognized every sanctified and authorized relationship existing here on earth-of parent and child, brother and sister, husband and wife.
To them marriage is not, can never be, a civil compact alone; its significance reaches beyond the grave; its obligations are eternal; and the Latter day Saints are notable for the sanctity with which they invest the marital state.
In whatever light this practise has been regarded in the past, it is today a dead issue, forbidden by ecclesiastical rule as it is prohibited by legal statute.
He was unjustly charged with favoring secession; but the charge was soon disproved.
But the people have suspended the practise of plural marriage; and the testimony of the governors, judges, and district attorneys of the territory, and later that of the officers of the state, have declared the sincerity of the renunciation.
Yet the two have often been confused in the popular mind.
But let us turn more particularly to the history of the Church itself.
It could not be doubted that war was imminent; already the conflict had begun, and a picked part of the army was away in the western wilds, doing nothing for any phase of the public good.
With the seal of the holy Priesthood upon their wedded state, these people believe implicitly in the perpetuity of that relationship on the far side of the grave.
However, it was known that certain of his cabinet were in league with the seceding states; and prominent among them was john Floyd, secretary of war.
When the history of that great struggle with its antecedent and its consequent circumstances is written with a pen that shall indite naught but truth, when prejudice and partisanship are lived down, it may appear that Jefferson Davis rather than james Buchanan was the prime cause of the great mistake.
And the world is learning, to its manifest surprise, that plural marriage and "Mormonism" are not synonymous terms.
Federal judges and United States attorneys in Utah, who were not "Mormons" nor lovers of "Mormonism," refused to entertain complaints or prosecute cases under the law, because of its manifest injustice and inadequacy. But other laws followed, most of which, as the Latter day Saints believe, were aimed directly at their religious conception of the marriage contract, and not at social impropriety nor sexual offense.
Today the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints is stronger than ever before; and the people are confident that it is at its weakest stage for all time to come.
As the people had adopted the practise under what was believed to be divine approval, they suspended it when they were justified in so doing.
The "Mormon" people saw in their terrible experiences and in the outrages to which they had been subjected, only the mal administration of laws and the subversion of justice through human incapacity and hatred.
The troops, once in Utah, had to be provisioned; and everything the settlers could spare was eagerly bought at an unusual price. The gold changed hands.
It is also told how, at the commencement of the rebellion, he allied himself with the confederate forces, accepting the rank of brigadier general. It was through Floyd's advice that Buchanan ordered the military expedition to Utah, ostensibly to install certain federal officials and to repress an alleged infantile rebellion which in fact had never come into existence, but in reality to further the interests of the secessionists.
The army found the people in poverty, and left them in comparative wealth.
Its creed provides for the protection of all men in their rights of worship according to the dictates of conscience.
This statement assumes, as granted, a distinction between bigamy and the "Mormon" institution of plural marriage.
The successful efforts of this officer to disarm the North, while accumulating the munitions of war in the South; to scatter the forces by locating them in widely separated and remote stations; and in other ways to dispose of the regular army in the manner best calculated to favor the anticipated rebellion, are matters of history.
In eighteen sixty two, a law was enacted with the purpose of suppressing plural marriage, and, as had been predicted in the national Senate prior to its passage, it lay for many years a dead letter.
But perhaps I am suspected of having forgotten or of having intentionally omitted reference to what popular belief once considered the chief feature of "Mormonism," the cornerstone of the structure, the secret of its influence over its members, and of its attractiveness to its proselytes, viz., the peculiarity of the "Mormon" institution of marriage.
And surely such conjectures were pardonable on the part of all whose ignorance and prejudice still nursed the delusion of "Mormon" disloyalty. Moreover, had the people been inclined to rebellion what greater opportunity could they have wished?
After all, the "Mormon" people regard the advent of the Buchanan army as one of the greatest material blessings ever brought to them.
And so the story of "Mormonism" runs on; its finale has not yet been written; the current press presents continuously new stages of its progress, new developments of its plan.
Then, in their hasty departure, the soldiers disposed of everything outside of actual necessities in the way of accouterment and camp equipage.
It is possible that I may be in a position then to indicate some course of action.
You will see that I have said, 'I have determined not to go in for the examination.
"I should like to have a peep at each of them," said Holmes.
You observe that the scratch on that table is slight at one side, but deepens in the direction of the bedroom door.
For a moment Gilchrist, with upraised hand, tried to control his writhing features.
"Come now, Bannister," said Holmes.
Bannister's face was ghastly.
Wasn't it natural, sir, that I should save him, and wasn't it natural also that I should try to speak to him as his dead father would have done, and make him understand that he could not profit by such a deed?
It was before I knew that my sin had found me out.
He put his shoes on the table.
Well, come along and put friend Soames out of his pain."
My friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure, but shrugged his shoulders in half humorous resignation.
"Gloves," said the young man.
"You can be perfectly easy in your mind.
"Just close the door," said Holmes.
"Have you anything positive to tell him?"
"He put his gloves on the chair, and he took the proofs, sheet by sheet, to copy them.
"There was no man, sir."
That's the puzzling part.
I knew those gloves well, and I understood their message.
Bannister licked his dry lips.
"But this rascal?"
"No good, my dear Watson.
I could not see that in either case Holmes had come upon the clue for which he was searching.
Meanwhile, you change nothing-nothing at all."
Time was, sir, when I was butler to old Sir Jabez Gilchrist, this young gentleman's father. When he was ruined I came to the college as servant, but I never forgot my old employer because he was down in the world.
Holmes made no further allusion to the matter that day, though he sat lost in thought for a long time after our belated dinner.
This, the best and only final clue, has run to nothing.
The man's face set in sullen defiance.
When we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle, we again looked up at the windows.
"He looked at us in a queer way."
"The foul mouthed fellow at the top.
"No, sir, certainly not."
"Very good, mr Holmes."
A tall, flaxen haired, slim young fellow opened it, and made us welcome when he understood our errand.
If the proofs were in a roll, he could not possibly know what they were.
The printer one could, of course, dismiss.
Such an idea was absurd.
It was not a dangerous exploit for he could always pretend that he had simply looked in to ask a question.
In a few hours the examination would commence, and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuable scholarship. He could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation, and he ran towards Holmes with two eager hands outstretched.
He is taller than the Indian, not so tall as Gilchrist.
Watson you here!
One of them seems restless enough."
"But why did you change your purpose?"
"I think so."
As we know, he came back by the side gate.
He is the one with the worst record.
He could examine the papers in his own office.
"Yes, sir, I have, but the shock of this disgraceful exposure has bewildered me.
Of the centre table I could make nothing, until in your description of Gilchrist you mentioned that he was a long distance jumper.
Shall I do so?
Up to now you may have spoken the truth, but now I know that you have lied."
"In that case, you can give us no further information.
His troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us, and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon Bannister in the farther corner.
Which is yours?"
I suppose five foot six would be about it."
"No names, please!" said Holmes, as we knocked at Gilchrist's door.
"You know him?"
Bannister entered, and shrank back in evident surprise and fear at our judicial appearance.
"No, indeed," said Holmes, heartily, springing to his feet.
"Really, mr Holmes, I cannot undertake to say.
"Good heavens! have you nothing to add?" cried Soames.
But that fellow DOES puzzle me."
An instant later the tutor returned, bringing with him the student.
"Nothing to add?"
It is not for nothing that I have turned myself out of bed at the untimely hour of six.
Holmes was so charmed with one of them that he insisted on drawing it in his notebook, broke his pencil, had to borrow one from our host and finally borrowed a knife to sharpen his own.
I will take the black clay with me, also the pencil cuttings.
You there, if you please, Soames!
All were agreed that one could be ordered, but that it was not a usual size of pencil and that it was seldom kept in stock.
"Nothing at all, sir."
"No, no, mr Gilchrist, sir, I never said a word-never one word!" cried the servant.
What with your eternal tobacco, Watson, and your irregularity at meals, I expect that you will get notice to quit, and that I shall share your downfall-not, however, before we have solved the problem of the nervous tutor, the careless servant, and the three enterprising students."
It was the Indian, whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon his blind.
If this matter is not to become public, we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court martial.
"Come, come, Bannister!"
"Yes, sir, it is true," said he.
"There is the man who set me in the right path," said he.
He was a fine figure of a man, tall, lithe, and agile, with a springy step and a pleasant, open face.
"Aha!
I'll take the armchair in the middle.
"Yes, my dear Watson, I have solved the mystery."
"Why, Bannister, the servant.
The others were invisible.
Kindly ring the bell!"
On the other hand, it seemed an unthinkable coincidence that a man should dare to enter the room, and that by chance on that very day the papers were on the table.
"Who?"
"I have told you everything, sir."
We can be perfectly frank with each other.
"Now, mr Gilchrist, we are all quite alone here, and no one need ever know one word of what passes between us.
He was pacing swiftly up and down his room.
Shall the examination proceed?"
Here it is, sir.
"I don't care who you are.
Come, Watson!
"He shall not compete."
There was no possible escape.
"There is nothing in that.
Perhaps it would be easier for you if I were to tell mr Soames what occurred, and you can check me where I am wrong.
The man who entered knew that the papers were there.
"But what fresh evidence could you have got?"
Why should a perfectly honest man-Well, well, here's a large stationer's.
"That is very important," said Holmes.
As he passed your window he saw, by means of his great height, these proofs upon your table, and conjectured what they were.
"Good gracious, mr Holmes, you are surely not going to leave me in this abrupt fashion! You don't seem to realize the position.
The outer door would not open to our knock, and nothing more substantial than a torrent of bad language came from behind it.
Good bye."
As to you, sir, I trust that a bright future awaits you in Rhodesia.
I am six feet high, and I could do it with an effort. No one less than that would have a chance.
"Come, come," said Holmes, kindly, "it is human to err, and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal.
"I think so.
I must take some definite action to night.
On the palm were three little pyramids of black, doughy clay.
Many men do it when they are trying to learn anything by heart."
"Certainly."
Well, sir, when I came into this room yesterday, when the alarm was given, the very first thing I saw was mr Gilchrist's tan gloves a lying in that chair.
"No difficulty in the world," Soames answered.
"Is it possible?"
"I entered, and I took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side table.
"It will be clear to you, from what I have said, that only you could have let this young man out, since you were left in the room, and must have locked the door when you went out. As to his escaping by that window, it was incredible.
What was it you put on that chair near the window?"
No harm would have been done had it not been that, as he passed your door, he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant.
Can you do without breakfast?"
Holmes looked triumphantly at Bannister.
Look at that!"
The unfortunate young man staggered back, and cast a look full of horror and reproach at Bannister.
Our guide cried aloud in his astonishment and dismay.
I was measuring how tall a man would need to be in order to see, as he passed, what papers were on the central table.
What's that?
Have I told the truth, mr Gilchrist?"
He thought the tutor must return by the main gate and that he would see him.
"Ah, that's a pity, Bannister.
The student had drawn himself erect.
"I frankly admit that I am unable to prove it.
"He impressed me as being a perfectly honest man."
The unfortunate tutor was certainly in a state of pitiable agitation when we found him in his chambers.
The Indian still paced his room.
"And now, mr Soames, I wish you good night."
I shall drop round early to morrow morning and chat the matter over.
What's his game in the matter?"
Come along, and I will personally conduct you."
"From the moment, mr Soames, that you said to me that no one, not even Bannister, could have told that the papers were in your room, the case began to take a definite shape in my mind.
"Well, then, I must make some suggestions to you.
I dismissed that.
I flopped down into that chair, and nothing would budge me until mr Soames he went for you.
But, indeed, I have little doubt that we can build up a sufficient case without it.
The situation must be faced."
"Yes, let it proceed, by all means."
"Now, Bannister, will you please tell us the truth about yesterday's incident?"
Pencils, too, and knives-all was satisfactory.
I cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with.
The next he had thrown himself on his knees beside the table, and burying his face in his hands, he had burst into a storm of passionate sobbing.
Gilchrist pointed to Bannister.
If mr Soames saw them, the game was up.
"Can you tell me his exact height?" he asked.
There were some really curious pieces of mediaeval domestic architecture within.
"And one more this morning.
There were only four stationers of any consequences in the town, and at each Holmes produced his pencil chips, and bid high for a duplicate.
How did he know?
"When I approached your room, I examined the window.
"You will kindly close the door," said Holmes.
No one there, I suppose?"
"Well, if there is nothing to be learned here, we had best go inside."
"I dare not go so far as that.
I was in such a hurry to come to you."
Then he tossed it down and seized the next.
"Good gracious, mr Holmes, do you mean to tell me that, all the time I was talking to Bannister in this room, we had the man prisoner if we had only known it?"
I found that the key was indeed his, that he had entered my room to know if I wanted tea, and that he had very carelessly left the key in the door when he came out.
The exercise consists of half a chapter of Thucydides.
"I trust, mr Holmes, that you can spare me a few hours of your valuable time.
"I understand," said Holmes, "that you left your key in the door?"
"To my bedroom."
Where were you when you began to feel bad?"
I left him collapsed in the chair.
"Let us be practical," said he.
Your servant seems to have quite recovered. You left him in a chair, you say.
I will look after the proofs."
"Yes."
For an instant I imagined that I had left my own there, but on feeling in my pocket I found that it was all right.
Above all things, I desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly."
"No one save the printer."
The pencil was not an ordinary one.
Now, mr Soames-at your disposal!"
"How long did you stay?"
"To the best of my belief, they were rolled up."
And it looks out on an angle of the courtyard so as to be partly invisible.
"I will tell you, then, in a few words the character of the three men who inhabit these rooms.
Holmes gave an enigmatic smile.
The proof was in three long slips.
I nearly fainted, sir."
"I should like to have a glance round.
He was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreat-VERY hurried, since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there.
"For an instant I imagined that Bannister had taken the unpardonable liberty of examining my papers.
I was at my wit's end, when suddenly the happy thought occurred to me that you were in the town, and I came straight round to put the matter into your hands.
Do help me, mr Holmes.
Well, anyhow, that was in his mind.
His plump face was twitching with his nervousness, and his fingers could not keep still.
"You see?"
"The first page on the floor, the second in the window, the third where you left it," said he.
I gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair, while I made a most careful examination of the room.
"I must explain to you, mr Holmes, that to morrow is the first day of the examination for the Fortescue Scholarship.
"Pray continue your very interesting statement."
Let me see the three strips.
"no"
"For which he was entered?"
Holmes halted and looked earnestly at the window.
This is of interest, Watson.
We stood at the entrance while Holmes made an examination of the carpet.
I am one of the examiners.
He was nearly expelled over a card scandal in his first year.
"I don't know, sir, it didn't matter to me where I sat"
"Did you look at these papers on the table?"
It began with a thin scratch and ended in a jagged hole.
A Gothic arched door led to a worn stone staircase.
"Exactly, mr Holmes.
"One hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs."
"Excellent!" said Holmes, who was recovering his good humour as his attention became more engrossed by the case.
There is no opening except the one pane," said our learned guide.
Why did you pass these other chairs?"
"To day, about three o'clock, the proofs of this paper arrived from the printers.
I don't know whether you observed my bedroom window?"
Holmes shook his head impatiently.
"Exactly.
It was already twilight when we reached the scene of our problem.
"Yes."
"Yes, sir."
"I was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin, some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface.
"By the window there."
Above were three students, one on each story.
"The moment I looked at my table, I was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers.
"Yes, there are."
I thought I would come back for the key. Then I forgot."
He was looking very bad-quite ghastly."
"Whom do you suspect?"
You are aware that Johann Faber is the most common maker's name.
And the cut-a positive tear, I see.
"Have you been in it since your adventure?"
"Bannister was very much upset by the incident.
"I locked up the papers first."
As a matter of fact, the drawn curtain disclosed nothing but three or four suits of clothes hanging from a line of pegs.
What could this n n be?
All right; come if you want to.
My scholar has been left very poor, but he is hard-working and industrious.
Well, he carried over this one first, and he copied it.
Where does that door lead to?"
My friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of Baker Street.
Then he approached it, and, standing on tiptoe with his neck craned, he looked into the room.
I had, however, promised to take tea in a friend's rooms, so I left the proof upon my desk.
"He must have entered through the door.
It is at the end of a word.
Not only this, but on the table I found a small ball of black dough or clay, with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it.
"You left your door open?"
A large sum of money is at stake, for the scholarship is a very valuable one, and an unscrupulous man might very well run a risk in order to gain an advantage over his fellows.
"When mr Soames returned and called for you, you were very much disturbed?"
"The top floor belongs to Miles McLaren.
On the ground floor was the tutor's room.
Holmes held it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light.
"Did anyone know that these proofs would be there?"
"This was not all.
Is it not clear that there is just as much of the pencil left as usually follows the Johann?" He held the small table sideways to the electric light.
He shrugged his shoulders in ungracious acquiescence, while our visitor in hurried words and with much excitable gesticulation poured forth his story.
The man entered and took the papers, sheet by sheet, from the central table.
"It was about half past four.
I have a new writing table with a fine surface of red leather.
It was a small pyramid of black, putty like stuff, exactly like the one upon the table of the study.
The lecturer unlocked the outer door and ushered us into his room.
"Then it amounts to this, mr Soames: that, unless the Indian student recognized the roll as being proofs, the man who tampered with them came upon them accidentally without knowing that they were there."
I had left them all together.
"Did this man Bannister know?"
Which chair?"
Now I found a clean cut in it about three inches long-not a mere scratch, but a positive cut.
"So it seems to me."
I am convinced that these marks were left by the man who rifled the papers.
How could you possibly know that?"
What about this curtain?
"I had the tea tray in my hand.
"As a matter of fact, he could not," said Soames, "for I entered by the side door."
He will do well.
"But might be recognized as proofs?"
There are others.
As you say, there appear to be grains of sawdust in it.
Not one of your cases, Watson-mental, not physical.
A broken tip of lead was lying there also.
Evidently the rascal had copied the paper in a great hurry, had broken his pencil, and had been compelled to put a fresh point to it."
"Possibly."
"It is a very delicate question," said he.
He carried them over to the window table, because from there he could see if you came across the courtyard, and so could effect an escape."
I am prepared to swear, and so is Bannister, that it was smooth and unstained.
"How came you to leave the key in the door?"
"Anyone in the room could get out?"
"I am afraid there are no signs here," said he.
He has been idling all this term, and he must look forward with dread to the examination."
"Exactly.
I soon saw that the intruder had left other traces of his presence besides the rumpled papers.
Let us take the little table first.
There were no footmarks and no other evidence as to his identity.
The man might have effected his entrance there, left traces as he passed through the bedroom, and finally, finding the door open, have escaped that way."
"No, sir-certainly not."
Soames hesitated.
"We are investigating this unhappy business, Bannister," said his master.
"Very good.
I have finished with the carpet.
He denied it, however, with the utmost earnestness, and I am convinced that he was speaking the truth.
He is a quiet, inscrutable fellow; as most of those Indians are.
Without his scrapbooks, his chemicals, and his homely untidiness, he was an uncomfortable man.
Holmes stirred for the first time.
But, of the three, he is perhaps the least unlikely."
I beg you, mr Holmes, to do what you can."
"Ah, that's good!
"The case is not entirely devoid of interest.
"Lattice paned, lead framework, three separate windows, one swinging on hinge, and large enough to admit a man."
mr Soames was a tall, spare man, of a nervous and excitable temperament.
No, I see nothing.
I was absent rather more than an hour.
What could he do? He caught up everything which would betray him, and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself."
"Well," said he, "let us go round.
He is a brilliant fellow when he chooses to work-one of the brightest intellects of the university; but he is wayward, dissipated, and unprincipled.
"When did you enter the room?"
"I think it is clear enough.
He is well up in his work, though his Greek is his weak subject.
The alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door, had known that I was out, and had entered to look at the papers.
"What could he have wanted there?"
"It was most unfortunate, sir.
"When I saw that he was absent, I withdrew at once."
"Surely there is another alternative, mr Holmes.
"One could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day.
"Thank you, that will do," said Holmes.
Now, mr Soames, we will take a walk in the quadrangle, if you please."
With due discretion the incident itself may, however, be described, since it serves to illustrate some of those qualities for which my friend was remarkable. I will endeavour, in my statement, to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place, or give a clue as to the people concerned.
Of course, what has happened is very clear.
"Well, he wrote so furiously that he broke his pencil, and had, as you observe, to sharpen it again.
Dear me, this is very interesting.
"I see.
On the table in the window were several shreds from a pencil which had been sharpened.
You see my dilemma.
His father was the notorious Sir Jabez Gilchrist, who ruined himself on the turf.
"Where is Bannister now?"
As I approached my outer door, I was amazed to see a key in it.
I had to read it over carefully, as the text must be absolutely correct.
The lower of the three is Gilchrist, a fine scholar and athlete, plays in the Rugby team and the cricket team for the college, and got his Blue for the hurdles and the long jump.
"I should much prefer that you called in the aid of the police."

Stung by anxiety for this little sister, she upbraided Miss W--- for her fancied indifference to Anne's state of health.
They "struck" eating till the resolution was rescinded, and Tabby was allowed to remain a helpless invalid entirely dependent upon them.

You will not seek in imagination for excitement, of which the vicissitudes of this life, and the anxieties from which you must not hope to be exempted, be your state what it may, will bring with them but too much.
At first, I could not say 'Thy will be done!' I felt rebellious, but I knew it was wrong to feel so.
The day dreams in which you habitually indulge are likely to induce a distempered state of mind; and in proportion as all the ordinary uses of the world seem to you flat and unprofitable, you will be unfitted for them without becoming fitted for anything else.

Take care of over excitement, and endeavour to keep a quiet mind (even for your health it is the best advice that can be given you): your moral and spiritual improvement will then keep pace with the culture of your intellectual powers.
For some unexplained reason, he had given up the idea of becoming a student of painting at the Royal Academy, and his prospects in life were uncertain, and had yet to be settled.
The former from reserve, the latter from timidity, avoided all friendships and intimacies beyond their family. Emily was impervious to influence; she never came in contact with public opinion, and her own decision of what was right and fitting was a law for her conduct and appearance, with which she allowed no one to interfere.

Bronte.
Let me now request that, if you ever should come to these Lakes while I am living here, you will let me see you.
What a nice little fir!" But this was what the Tree could not bear to hear.
THE FIR TREE
All passed so quickly, there was so much going on around him, the Tree quite forgot to look to himself.
"No," said the Tree.
"How it will shine this evening!"
"What are they about?" thought the Tree.
"Help!
Were Christmas but come!
What is it like?"
The Democratic Committee figured out a way to do this.
"I hoped you would be able to assist me on the lawn.
The office of Sheriff would pay about two thousand a year, and this sum Hopkins agreed to pay the liveryman and so relieve him of all the annoyance of earning it.
I'm Elizabeth Parsons."
Patsy and Beth supported their cousin loyally and assisted in the preparations.
The description she gave of the coming reception to the Woman's Political League was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them, and thus mr Hopkins failed to notice who the occupants of the other vehicle were.
Her eyes wandered to the maid's hands.
mr Hopkins had come to realize that he had "the fight of his life" on his hands, and that defeat meant his political ruin.
Standing before her was the young girl she had seen riding with mr Hopkins-the girl she had declared to be the missing daughter of mrs Rogers.
And this was why Kenneth and Beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy.
"Won't you run into the house and see if Martha can't spare one or two more maids?"
The campaign was now growing warm.
"How do you know my name, and why haven't I seen you here before?"
A sudden wave of scarlet swept over Eliza's face.
"I'm sorry," said Beth.
"Come in."
I have a headache."
He did not laugh at his opponents any longer.
It was thought that this clever arrangement would easily win the fight for Hopkins.
The thin fingers clasped and unclasped in little spasmodic jerks and belied the quiet smile upon the face above them.
"I abhor crowds.
"I wish," said Beth, slowly, "I knew you."
However her features and form might repress any evidence of nervousness, these hands told a different story.
She rose quickly to her feet, with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath.
There are so many people that we can't give them proper attention."
CHAPTER twelve
Monroe County, where both Forbes and Hopkins resided, was one of the Democratic strongholds of the State.
The maid raised her eyebrows with a gesture of genuine surprise.
I counted on Eliza Parsons, the new girl I hired for the linen room and to do mending; but Eliza said she had a headache this morning and couldn't stand the sun, So I let her off.
Then she gave a little laugh, and replied:
"Where is she, Martha?
"But it can't be," protested the girl.
The day of the entertainment was as sunny and mild as heart could desire.
Under ordinary conditions Reynolds was sure to be elected, but the Committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to elect Hopkins.
"I will go," said Beth, a little frightened at the passionate appeal.
"Will you excuse my answering that question?" she asked.
Eliza closed the door behind her with a decided slam, and a key clicked in the lock.
"Aren't you Lucy Rogers?"
This was why he held several long conferences with his friend Marshall, the manager at the mill.
"We ought to have more attendants, Beth," said Louise, approaching her cousin.
Every scheme known to politicians must be worked, and none knew the intricate game better than Hopkins.
I'll go and ask her."
The Fairview band was engaged to discourse as much harmony as it could produce, and the resources of the great house were taxed to entertain the guests.
So she greeted the girl cordially, and said:
"Maids?
To himself he admitted their shrewdness and activity and acknowledged that an experienced head was managing their affairs.
Eliza Parsons shook her head.
BETH MEETS A REBUFF
The only thing necessary was to "fix" Seth Reynolds, and this Hopkins arranged personally.
The gardens and grounds were gaily decorated with Chinese and Japanese lanterns, streamers and Forbes banners.
But she didn't seem very sick to me."
mr Cummings, who was to profit by the deal, was called to a private consultation and agreed to slaughter Kenneth Forbes to secure votes for himself.
"I obtained the situation only a few days ago.
They-they excite me, in some way, and I-I can't bear them.
This canvass was quite satisfactory, for final report showed only about a hundred majority for Forbes.
This "trading votes," which was often done, was considered by the politicians quite legitimate.
By ten o'clock the farm wagons began to drive up, loaded with women and children, for all were invited except the grown men.
"Excuse me, please.
"I wish I knew myself," she cried, fiercely.
Tables were spread on the lawn and a dainty but substantial repast was to be served.
Her manner was neither independent nor assertive, but rather one of well bred composure and calm reliance.
She even seemed mildly amused at the attention she attracted.
The girl entered, and gave an involuntary cry of surprise.
"Where is your home?"
A man named Cummings was the Republican and Seth Reynolds, the liveryman, the Democratic nominee.
A speakers' stand, profusely decorated, had been erected on the lawn, and hundreds of folding chairs provided for seats.
For a moment Beth stood staring, while the new maid regarded her with composure and a slight smile upon her beautiful face.
"Why cannot you answer it?"
But the Honorable Erastus had no intention of "taking chances," or "monkeying with fate," as he tersely expressed it.
mr Hopkins had picked her up from the path leading from the rear gate of the Elmhurst grounds, and she had given him accurate information concerning the movements of the girl campaigners.
Louise was making great preparations to entertain the Woman's Political League, an organization she had herself founded, the members of which were wives of farmers in the district.
Beth felt that she was intruding and knew that she ought to go; yet some fascination held her to the spot.
You must excuse me."
"No, Miss Beth.
I attend to the household mending, you know, and care for the linen.
Beth looked at the strange girl without taking the hint to retire. Somehow, she could not rid herself of the impression that whether or not she was mistaken in supposing Eliza to be the missing Lucy, she had stumbled upon a sphinx whose riddle was well worth solving.
Beth was a beautiful girl-the handsomest of the three cousins, by far; yet Eliza surpassed her in natural charm, and seemed well aware of the fact.
She sat down in a rocking chair, and clasping her hands in her lap, rocked slowly back and forth.
But, to offset this cheering condition, the Democratic agents who made the canvass reported that there was an air of uncertainty throughout the district, and that many of those who declared for Hopkins were lukewarm and faint hearted, and might easily be induced to change their votes. This was what must be prevented.
For the first time the maid seemed a little confused, and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor.
I had to stand by Lucy-she's so sweet and gentle, and so sensitive.
And it ruins a man's disposition."
"No, indeed," he replied, frankly.
Then he deliberately locked Kenneth and Beth in with the forger, and retreated along the passage.
I'll pay twice sixty dollars for the delivery to me of the forged check, and the withdrawal of the prosecution."
"He was fairly prosperous before that, for mrs Rogers was an energetic and sensible woman, and kept old Will hard at work.
"Is there no way to save him?" asked Kenneth.
"I admit that.
"But it was a generous act, too," said Beth.
"no Old Will is a fine fellow, but poor and helpless since mrs Rogers had her accident."
"I'll pay all the costs besides."
Kenneth and Beth went away quite happy with their success, and the manager stood in his little window and watched them depart.
Fairview was twelve miles away, but by ten o'clock they drew up at the county jail.
"Lucy could have looked after her mother," said young Bates, "but old Will was stubborn and wouldn't let her.
The manager was in, Kenneth and Beth learned, but could not see them until he had signed the letters he had dictated for the noon mail.
"We wish to talk with him," answered Kenneth.
"Yes; she'll worry about me, I know.
"Her husband didn't tell us that," said the girl.
"Sure ly!
"If the prosecution were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the forged check, then the young man would be allowed his freedom. But under the circumstances I doubt if such an arrangement could be made."
I was bookkeeper, so it was easy to get a blank check and forge the signature.
I'll come and get you then.
It was a busy place, perhaps the busiest in the whole of the Eighth District, and in it were employed a large number of men.
You don't smoke, do you, mr Forbes?"
The Squierses are a selfish, hard fisted lot, and the old lady, especially, is a well known virago. But they could not have proven a case against Lucy, if she was innocent, and all their threats of arresting her were probably mere bluff.
"Pay it, Ken," she whispered.
"Why did you do it?" asked Beth.
"I understand now," said Beth.
By compromising with me you can recover your loss and are paid for your annoyance."
Sorry we haven't any reception room in the jail.
But he's very young, and his youth is largely responsible for his folly."
They were received in the little office by a man named Markham, who was the jailer.
"Well, stick it out, old man; don't give in."
I've just stopped smoking a few days ago, and it's got on my nerves something awful!"
My crime is so serious that the circuit judge has to sit on the case."
He is supposed to sign all the checks of the concern.
"No, mr Markham."
It won't be much, but I'm grateful to find a friend. I'm guilty, you know, and there's no one to blame but myself."
"Miss DeGraf," said Kenneth, noticing the boy's face critically, as he stood where the light from the passage fell upon it.
He spoke simply, but paced up and down the narrow cell in front of them. It was evident that his feelings were deeper than he cared to make evident.
"It was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved.
"Indeed there is never an excuse for crime.
I haven't heard from her since the day she came here to see me-right after my arrest."
So the girl saw something must be done and went to work.
"Whose name did you sign to the check?" asked Kenneth.
"He's a forger, mr Forbes; a deliberate criminal."
There was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face.
Why should you do all this?"
that's different," observed Markham, altering his demeanor. "You mustn't mind my being gruff and grumpy, mr Forbes.
He also wrote a note to his lawyer directing him to withdraw the prosecution.
Come this way, please."
"It has cost me twice sixty dollars in annoyance."
"Yes, sir."
"We've come to inquire about your case, Gates," said Kenneth.
Well, sir, what about him?"
You may as well understand, sir, that I stand for the Democratic candidate, and have no sympathy with your side."
That's how all the trouble came about."
The mill was at the outskirts of the town.
I've come to talk with you about young Gates."
THE FORGED CHECK
But I'll have a trial in a few days, they say.
"Yes.
Why, he's a fool, that's what he is.
Well! what for?" he demanded.
"She's at home, I suppose.
"I'm so glad, Ken-so glad!
"How are you feeling, today?"
"Lucy is very proud.
"That doesn't interest me, especially, sir," answered Kenneth, smiling. "I'm not electioneering just now.
He only discharged the man who was responsible for the fire."
He detested the grasping disposition that would endeavor to take advantage of his evident desire to help young Gates.
"I have my own reasons, mr Marshall.
"Thank you, mr Markham," replied a quiet voice, as a young man came forward from the dim interior of the cell.
I only say I'd do the same thing again."
Please look at the matter from a business standpoint.
"He was soft hearted and impetuous," said Beth; "and, being in love, he didn't stop to count the cost."
So as soon as breakfast was over the next morning Beth and Kenneth took one of the automobiles, the boy consenting unwillingly to this sort of locomotion because it would save much time.
He might have had that forged check for the face of it, if he'd been sharp. You wouldn't catch 'Rast Hopkins doing such a fool stunt.
But Marshall never even thanked me.
He looked up rather ungraciously, but motioned them to be seated.
"He stole my money."
"I am Kenneth Forbes, of Elmhurst.
It was better for him to think the girl unfeeling than to know the truth.
"We have heard something of your story," said Kenneth, "and are interested in it.
"It's nearly two weeks now.
He was a round faced, respectable appearing fellow, but his mood was distinctly unsociable.
"Oh, did she have an accident?" asked Beth.
He was silent and turned his face away.
Kenneth hesitated a moment.
I'm running for Representative on the Republican ticket," said Kenneth, quietly.
"Would you like that?" asked Beth.
He was of sturdy, athletic build and dressed neatly in a suit that was of coarse material but well brushed and cared for.
If you send the boy to prison you will still suffer the loss of the money.
Then Rogers wouldn't do anything but lead her around, and wait upon her, and the place went to rack and ruin."
"I won't, Tom.
"Sure ly, mr Forbes.
"Yes, sir, I plead guilty, although I've been told I ought not to confess.
I discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the whole plant.
I've seen lots of that kind in my day.
Give me a check for a hundred and fifty, and I'll turn over to you the forged check and quash further proceedings."
And now we must find the girl."
"I've been bothered already over your election campaign," resumed the manager, arranging his papers in a bored manner.
So this boy was doubly foolish in ruining himself to get sixty dollars to pay an unjust demand."
A fresh, wholesome looking boy, was Tom Gates, with steady gray eyes, an intelligent forehead, but a sensitive, rather weak mouth.
I'll take you to his cell, myself.
The young man is guilty, and he must suffer the penalty."
"Couldn't her parents have helped her?" inquired Kenneth.
"You're right.
"Talk! what's the good?
"Here's visitors, Tom."
Kenneth decided that he was ill at ease and in a state of dogged self repression.
"Of all the easy marks I ever encountered," muttered mr Marshall, "this young Forbes is the easiest.
I don't say I did right.
"His trial has not yet taken place, and instead of your devoting considerable of your valuable time appearing against him it would be much simpler to settle the matter right here and now."
One morning she tried to light the fire with kerosene, and lost her sight.
Forbes, of Elmhurst?" he asked, glancing at the card Kenneth had sent in.
"I'll make your money loss good."
"How long ago were you arrested?" asked Beth.
You're no friend of Tom Gates.
"But it will be best that way.
And to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars!
She's blind."
Kenneth and Beth refrained from telling the other girls or Uncle john of old Will Rogers's visit, but they got mr Watson in the library and questioned him closely about the penalty for forging a check.
Beth, uneasy at his silence, nudged him.
He unlocked the door, and called:
"Thank you, sir.
"I can't see it in that light," said the old lawyer.
"And he deserves a term in state's prison."
"In what way, mr Forbes?"
"I'm going to see mr Marshall," said Kenneth, "and discover what I can do to assist you."
"Will you leave us alone, please, mr Markham?"
"We're going to try it, anyhow," was the prompt decision.
Nevertheless, I should like to save him," said Kenneth.
Had I? Had I?
Here is his scarf, which has evidently been strained, and on it are spots of blood, while all around are marks indicating a struggle.
"Have we been together?" "That's his knife, at any rate.
It did not beckon, or indeed move at all; it was as still as the hand of death.
Gradually I knew I was mastering him-then all was blank.
"I think I am ill."
What is that in your hand?"
"Look, mr Blake; do you recognize this?"
Then I heard Tom say-
DARK DREAMS AND NIGHT SHADOWS
"But you have been together."
I say you do know what this means, and you must tell us."
A flash of light.
What could it be?
CHAPTER eleven
My position was too terrible.
I-I do not know."
What was that?
Undoubtedly the Egyptian knew too much for Voltaire, and so I was made a tool whereby he could be freed from troublesome obstacles.
Then I fell down at Tom Temple's feet.
I stood alone.
"He's better now.
"Of course not," said Joyce.
I just touched something soft!" On the instant, Joyce was at her side with the candle.
Presently she spoke:
"The poor little things!" cried Cynthia.
First they took turns sweeping, as best they could, with a very ancient and frowsy broom, the thick, moth eaten carpet.
But they'll have to do.
"I've got it!" she announced.
"Perhaps that's so," admitted Joyce, thoughtfully.
"You must be right," admitted Cynthia.
These two cherubic infants had both big brown eyes, fat red cheeks, and adorable, fluffy golden curls.
"'tuesday april sixteenth eighteen sixty one.'"
"I thought we were 'stumped' again when I first saw that picture, but it's been of some use, after all.
But let's go and finish our studying now, and get that out of the way.
I wonder, though, if people could see the light from the street, through any chinks in the boarding?"
They were certainly no nearer the solution of their problem.
"I'm just dog tired!"
There isn't a doubt but what that baby was she."
"What annoyance?"
"Do you wish it?"
Believe me, it is not fatigue that saddens you to night."
"I suspect."
"Bodily, I suppose?"
"No; I wish to talk to you."
"I leave you, then," said Raoul, as he withdrew.
Night.
"Yes, you are right; but I do not think any danger is to be apprehended from Buckingham."
"Yes; bodily."
"Cruelly."
"I am fatigued."
The count advanced a step towards his friend, and pressed him warmly in his arms.
"Nay, where it does exist."
"No; still he is intrusive.
"What do you mean?"
"One could almost swear to it, to observe him."
"What I said to him, count," replied Raoul, "I will repeat to you. Listen to me.
Concord returned to its place amidst the tents.
"That of this evening."
I wish you good night."
She changed color for a moment, and looked at him, with a pretty, reluctant tenderness, as she took her chair.
I hope you have no prejudice against Americans.
Our first impressions of people are, in nine cases out of ten, the right impressions.
My spirits sank as I looked round me.
mr Meadowcroft's invalid chair had been wheeled to the head of the table.
The door opened once more.
Even when he spoke to mr Meadowcroft, he was still on his guard-on his guard against the two young men, as I fancied by the direction which his eyes took on these occasions.
I liked Naomi Colebrook at first sight; liked her pleasant smile; liked her hearty shake of the hand when we were presented to each other.
He looked up at Naomi doubtingly from his plate, and looked down again slowly with a frown. When I addressed him, he answered constrainedly.
I looked at my watch.
I followed the groom up to my room, not over well pleased with my first experience of the farm.
On his right-hand side sat his sad and silent daughter.
When we began our meal, I had noticed for the first time that Silas Meadowcroft's left hand was strapped up with surgical plaster; and I now further observed that john Jago's wandering brown eyes, furtively looking at everybody round the table in turn, looked with a curious, cynical scrutiny at the young man's injured hand.
He was short, spare, and wiry; singularly pale for a person whose life was passed in the country.
The face was in other respects, besides this, a striking face to see.
When the two sons seized a stray remark of mine about animals in general, and applied it satirically to the mismanagement of sheep and oxen in particular, they looked at john Jago, while they talked to me.
The supper was not a merry one.
She was a melancholy, middle aged woman, without visible attractions of any sort-one of those persons who appear to accept the obligation of living under protest, as a burden which they would never have consented to bear if they had only been consulted first.
He is not well; he has come over the ocean for rest, and change of scene.
A young lady quietly joined the party at the supper table.
Was the young lady Naomi Colebrook?
For once in a way, I proved a true prophet.
Describing her generally, I may say that she had a small head, well carried, and well set on her shoulders; bright gray eyes, that looked at you honestly, and meant what they looked; a trim, slight little figure-too slight for our English notions of beauty; a strong American accent; and (a rare thing in America) a pleasantly toned voice, which made the accent agreeable to English ears.
A more dreary and more disunited family party I never sat at the table with.
"A little cracked"--that in the popular phrase was my impression of the stranger who now made his appearance in the supper room.
My library was limited to the Bible and the Prayer Book.
Naomi Colebrook at last!
But there was no marked character in either face.
I set them down as men with undeveloped qualities, waiting (the good and evil qualities alike) for time and circumstances to bring them to their full growth.
They pointedly drew back from john Jago as he approached the empty chair next to me and moved round to the opposite side of the table.
A pretty girl, and, so far as I could judge by appearances, a good girl too.
My room was clean-oppressively clean.
There I put the pilot's seat and a strong tiller for the rudder.
"'And these shall follow your thralls in the same way.
"'There, stand so!' I said, 'and glare and hiss at my foes.'
On a bench in a far corner were a dozen people huddled together.
"So I set guards over every one in that house.
"Oh! it is better to live on the sea and let other men raise your crops and cook your meals.
He took it and smiled, saying:
"'Who calls?'
Their eyes danced.
I sat high in the pilot's seat.
But I stayed that spring and built me a boat.
"'Now for the farm.
I drink this to your health.'
Have you always been a thrall?"
Two hundred warriors feasted in his hall and followed him to battle.
"The thralls were bringing in a great pot of meat.
"My men roared with laughter.
He shall not leave you day or night, whether you are working or playing or sleeping.
"'You would not eat with us.
Do you not think we shall be merry company?'
I stood with my back to the wall; for I wanted no sword reaching out of the dark for me.
We ate at many men's tables uninvited.
"He had three ships.
"'Now start up the fire,' I said.
"'I call,' I answered.
"Off they ran through a door at the back of the hall.
"So we harried the coast of Norway.
On the breast and sides I carved the dragon's scales.
There, far off, is my country, across the water.
'What man wants to spend the winter with no guests?'
"The night that it was finished I went to my father's feast.
The farmer crouched by the fire, afraid to move.
"I named nine others and said:
We went to it, and I struck it with my spear.
Did you ever have such a lordly guest before?'
After a while my men said:
Many men we found overburdened with gold.
"'Come, come!' I called, when no one obeyed.
"I went on:
'Viking is better for summer.
"'Ah!' another then cried out, sitting up.
'A fire!
The thrall's eyes flashed.
At last I stood up and said:
"'Not yet,' I answered.
Then I will get me a farm and will winter in that land.
We are hungry.'
I thought that all this night's work would be my death.'
"But others jumped to their feet with their mead horns in their hands. Thirty men, one after another, raised their horns and said:
"'What of the farm, Olaf?'
"Up and down the water we went to get much wealth and much frolic.
'Here comes something that will be a welcome guest to my stomach.'
So no tales got out to the neighbors.
"'I heard a cuckoo to day!'
"Well, after we had been there for a long time, Hakon came in to the feast one night and said:
"On the next morning we got into my dragon and started.
"'Hello!
Ten sons sat at meat with him, and I was the youngest.
"All my men put their hands to their mouths and shouted.
"'Ho, thralls!' I called to them.
At the prow I carved the head with open mouth and forked tongue thrust out.
'Bring in the table.
Leif and Grim shall be the same kind of friends to your two sons.'
It was so dark that I could see nothing but a few sparks on the hearth.
The farmer sat gloomily on the bench and would not eat, and you cannot wonder; for he saw us putting potfuls of his good beef and basket loads of bread into our big mouths. When the tables were taken out and the mead horns came round, I stood up and raised my horn and said to the farmer:
They set up a crane over the fire and hung the pot upon it, and we sat and watched it boil while we joked.
There were benches for twenty men along each side.
The eldest of you shall have my farm when I die.
So I will give out this law: that my men shall never leave you alone.
There was but one door to the house.
"'Well, friend farmer,' laughed one, 'why such a long face?
Now who will follow me?'
"'Come,' they cried, 'thank him for that, farmer.
"'Since it is to my health, I will drink it.
"The door opened only a little, but I pushed it wide and leaped into the room.
Hello!' I shouted, and my men made a great din.
"'Yes, a stingy host!
Besides, it was a lonely place, and by good luck no one came that way.
As our boat flashed down the rollers into the water I made this song and sang it:
"'My dragon's belly is never full,' and on board went the gold.
The rest of you, off a viking!'
"'This is my vow: I will sail to Norway and I will harry the coast and fill my boat with riches.
"'I like this little taste of your hospitality, friend farmer.
"At last some one from inside said:
"So we set off for it.
At last the supper began.
These he gave to three of my brothers.
When an artery is tied, the lateral channels increase not only in diameter, but in the thickness and strength of their coats.
EFFECTS OF THE INCREASED USE AND DISUSE OF PARTS.
But this subject will be more properly discussed when we treat of the different races of mankind.
When one kidney ceases to act from disease, the other increases in size, and does double work.
It is well known that use strengthens the muscles in the individual, and complete disuse, or the destruction of the proper nerve, weakens them. When the eye is destroyed, the optic nerve often becomes atrophied.
Gould endeavoured to ascertain the nature of the influences which thus act on stature; but he arrived only at negative results, namely that they did not relate to climate, the elevation of the land, soil, nor even "in any controlling degree" to the abundance or the need of the comforts of life.
dr Beddoe has lately proved that, with the inhabitants of Britain, residence in towns and certain occupations have a deteriorating influence on height; and he infers that the result is to a certain extent inherited, as is likewise the case in the United States.
Whether external conditions produce any other direct effect on man is not known.
Our supposed naturalist having proceeded thus far in his investigation, would next enquire whether the races of men, when crossed, were in any degree sterile.
In determining whether the supposed varieties of the same kind of domestic animal should be ranked as such, or as specifically distinct, that is, whether any of them are descended from distinct wild species, every naturalist would lay much stress on the fact of their external parasites being specifically distinct.
All the more stress would be laid on this fact, as it would be an exceptional one; for I am informed by mr Denny that the most different kinds of dogs, fowls, and pigeons, in England, are infested by the same species of Pediculi or lice.
Now let us apply these generally admitted principles to the races of man, viewing him in the same spirit as a naturalist would any other animal.
The races differ also in constitution, in acclimatisation and in liability to certain diseases.
We know that these qualities are easily affected by changed conditions of life, or by close inter breeding, and that they are governed by highly complex laws, for instance, that of the unequal fertility of converse crosses between the same two species.
mr Murray procured four kinds from Africa, namely, from the Negroes of the Eastern and Western coasts, from the Hottentots and Kaffirs; two kinds from the natives of Australia; two from North and two from South America.
In these latter cases it may be presumed that the Pediculi came from natives inhabiting different districts.
Even a slight degree of sterility between any two forms when first crossed, or in their offspring, is generally considered as a decisive test of their specific distinctness; and their continued persistence without blending within the same area, is usually accepted as sufficient evidence, either of some degree of mutual sterility, or in the case of animals of some mutual repugnance to pairing.
They give also corroborative evidence; but c Vogt thinks that the subject requires further investigation.), that the human skulls found in the caves of Brazil, entombed with many extinct mammals, belonged to the same type as that now prevailing throughout the American Continent.
The degrees of sterility do not coincide strictly with the degrees of difference between the parents in external structure or habits of life.
Our naturalist would then perhaps turn to geographical distribution, and he would probably declare that those forms must be distinct species, which differ not only in appearance, but are fitted for hot, as well as damp or dry countries, and for the Arctic regions.
It is here manifestly impossible to select the more sterile individuals, which have already ceased to yield seeds; so that the acme of sterility, when the germen alone is affected, cannot have been gained through selection.
Father Ripa makes exactly the same remark with respect to the Chinese.); and the Hindoo cannot at first perceive any difference between the several European nations.
These Pediculi were darker coloured, and appeared different from those proper to the natives of Chiloe in South America, of which he gave me specimens.
CHAPTER seven.
Their mental characteristics are likewise very distinct; chiefly as it would appear in their emotional, but partly in their intellectual faculties.
In every case in which many specimens were obtained the differences were constant. The surgeon of a whaling ship in the Pacific assured me that when the Pediculi, with which some Sandwich Islanders on board swarmed, strayed on to the bodies of the English sailors, they died in the course of three or four days.
Even some of the most strongly marked races cannot be identified with that degree of unanimity which might have been expected from what has been written on the subject.
dr Rohlfs writes to me that he found the mixed races in the Great Sahara, derived from Arabs, Berbers, and Negroes of three tribes, extraordinarily fertile.
These, again, appeared larger and much softer than European lice.
With forms which must be ranked as undoubted species, a perfect series exists from those which are absolutely sterile when crossed, to those which are almost or completely fertile.
Geographical distribution is often brought into play unconsciously and sometimes consciously; so that forms living in two widely separated areas, in which most of the other inhabitants are specifically distinct, are themselves usually looked at as distinct; but in truth this affords no aid in distinguishing geographical races from so-called good or true species.
Nevertheless, these men, if seen alive, would undoubtedly appear very distinct, so that we are clearly much influenced in our judgment by the mere colour of the skin and hair, by slight differences in the features, and by expression.
During this time, at the other end of the theater, near the lake, a young woman was seated, with her eyes fixed upon one of the windows of the theater, from which were issuing streams of light-the window in question being that of the royal box.
"Forgive me, I hardly know what I am saying; a thousand times forgive me; Madame was right, quite right, this brutal exile has completely turned my brain."
De Guiche, observing that she was alone, near a thicket constructed of painted cloth, approached her.
With this remark, accompanied by one of those deep sighs which affect the remotest fibers of one's being, his heart burdened with sorrow and throbbing fast, his head on fire, and his gaze wandering, he bowed breathlessly, and withdrew behind the thicket.
De Guiche had overheard everything.
The victim, however, of all these royal affections and affectations, was poor De Guiche. Every one could observe his agitation and prostration-a prostration which was, indeed, the more remarkable since people were not accustomed to see him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side, his head bewildered, and his eyes with all their bright intelligence bedimmed.
Do you love any one?"
"Yes, but if she should have understood, and understood too well, she may talk."
"Do you think so?" she replied with indifference.
"Come," said La Valliere, "these gentlemen have passed; let us take advantage of our being alone to cross the open ground and so take refuge in the woods."
"Good gracious! has the king any right to interfere in matters of that kind?
"In what way?"
Received me with kindness-perhaps so-yes-"
"Oh! there can be no doubt of it."
Beneath this oak the gardeners had piled up the moss and turf in such a manner that never had a seat more luxuriously rested the wearied limbs of man or monarch.
She saw, but did not look at De Guiche, who, irritated and revengeful, turned his back upon her as she passed him, escorted by her nymphs, and followed by a hundred flatterers.
"Indeed!
"In that case I am indeed unhappy, and greatly to be pitied."
"You are positive, then?"
Upon this Madame deigned to turn her eyes languishingly towards the comte, observing.
"It seems the king will not consent to it."
"In other words," said Montalais, "she is insupportable.
"You mean Pomona, comte?"
Athenais began to laugh.
A quarter of an hour afterwards he returned to the theater; but it will be readily believed that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement that enabled him to go back; or perhaps, for love is thus strangely constituted, he found it impossible even to remain much longer separated from the presence of one who had broken his heart.
"You represented a divinity, beautiful, disdainful, inconstant."
Near the songster, in the dark background of the large trees, could be seen the glistening eyes of an owl, attracted by the harmony.
"Yes, very unhappy, and very much to be pitied, Monsieur de Guiche, for you seem to be suffering terribly."
"Why do you ask?" she inquired.
Look yonder, do you not see the moon slowly rising, silvering the topmost branches of the chestnuts and the oaks.
Remarking, therefore, that his obeisance obtained him no acknowledgement, he advanced one step further, and in a voice which he tried, though vainly, to render calm, said: "I have the honor to present my most humble respects to your royal highness."
A cold shiver passed through poor De Guiche; he was unprepared for such utter indifference, for he had neither seen nor been told of anything that had taken place, and consequently could guess nothing.
"Quick, quick, then, among the high reed grass," said Montalais; "stoop, Athenais, you are so tall."
"Have I offended you again?" said De Guiche.
Ah!
"And you, Louise?" said Montalais, "does any one please you?"
good day!"
"Do you, who are so clever, finish for me."
"Louise possesses every virtue, and has not a single fault." And the two young men passed on, and, as they proceeded, their voices were soon lost in the distance.
"What, already here!" they said to her.
Out yonder all are at this moment seated at table and fully occupied, or preparing to adorn themselves for a set and formal promenade; horses are being saddled, or harnessed to the carriages-the queen's mules or Madame's four white ponies.
"Quite true, and I believe you are right.
We are three in number, we like one another, and the night is lovely.
"No more than the dancing.
"Explain yourself?"
The arrow pierced his heart and wounded him mortally.
"Yes; but perhaps I frightened her."
"I! oh, no!"
The king remained for a moment to enjoy a triumph as complete as it could possibly be.
The three young girls, on their side, reached the outskirts of the park, every path of which they well knew.
The ditches were bordered by high hedges full of flowers, which on that side protected the foot passengers from being intruded upon by the horses and carriages.
Oh!
"I am a woman; and there are few like me; whoever loves me, flatters me; whoever flatters me, pleases me; and whoever pleases-"
"no"
I remember now, and I congratulate myself.
All these sufferings, successes, and remarks were blended, confounded, and lost in the uproar of applause.
The young girls had, indeed, made themselves small-indeed invisible.
"There cannot be a doubt he received you kindly, for, in fact, you returned without his permission."
"Pray do not leave me," said De Guiche, stretching out his hand towards her, "for you would be contradicting the kind words you have just pronounced.
Montalais agile as a deer, Athenais eager as a young wolf, bounded through the dry grass, and, now and then, some bold Acteon might, by the aid of the faint light, have perceived their straight and well formed limbs somewhat displayed beneath the heavy folds of their satin petticoats.
"Do you think so?
She then rose, humming the air to which she was presently going to dance.
He then turned towards Madame, for the purpose of admiring her also a little in her turn.
"But surely the enchanting spectacle?"
At this moment, a man, concealed in a dry ditch planted with young willow saplings, scrambled quickly up its shelving side, and ran off in the direction of the chateau.
"Well!" said Montalais, "you do not finish."
"You seem agitated."
"Oh! mademoiselle, why have I not a devoted sister, or a true friend, such as yourself?"
"We thought we should be first at the rendezvous."
"Yes; the character which your royal highness assumed is in perfect harmony with your own."
I was still half crazy at you know what; so that she could hardly have understood what I was saying, and must have grown alarmed."
When she perceived the young man, she rose, like a woman surprised in the midst of ideas she was desirous of concealing from herself.
"Oh!
As for ourselves, we shall soon reach some retired spot where no eyes can see us and no step follow ours.
"So much the better," said Athenais, "because I see the torches setting out from the chateau and the theater, and they seem as if they were preceding some person of distinction."
Remain, I implore you: the evening is most lovely.
"Yes."
"If I had only seen her, I should have declared it to be a vision, but I spoke to her."
You wish to escape from the merry tumult, and prefer your own society.
"I allude to the goddess."
His dark shadow glided, lengthening as it disappeared, among the illumined yews and glittering undulations of the water.
"And confidences too?"
"Oh!
The two young men approached still closer, conversing in animated tones. "She was here just now," said the count.
I am speaking seriously," replied Montalais, "and my opinion in this case is quite as good as the king's, I suppose; is it not, Louise?"
"And yet it seemed to me that the king received you with kindness."
It is to your recommendation, I am aware, that I owe my admission among the number of Madame's maids of honor."
Heaven!" he exclaimed, suddenly.
As De Guiche quitted the theater for the purpose of getting into the fresh air he so much needed, he passed close to this figure and saluted her.
Well, I can understand it; all women who are possessed of any feeling do, and one never finds them dull or lonely when removed from the giddy vortex of these exciting amusements.
The only reply Madame condescended to make was by slightly raising her shoulders, and, as her ladies of honor had discreetly retired while the conversation lasted, she recalled them by a look.
It rarely happened that any uneasiness was excited on his account, whenever a question of elegance or taste was under discussion; and De Guiche's defeat was accordingly attributed by the greater number present to his courtier like tact and ability.
"You do not know Louise, count," said Raoul.
"Well?"
The Ballet of the Seasons.
"Sire, they were sent at the hour promised."
"Yes; it is suppressed."
Monsieur was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter.
At the conclusion of the banquet, which was served at five o'clock, the king entered his cabinet, where his tailors were awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated costume representing Spring, which was the result of so much imagination, and had cost so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornament workers of the court.
"What do you mean?" inquired Louis.
"In my thoughts, monsieur, everything has changed."
The Elements, subaltern powers of mythology, together with their attributes, hastened to follow their gracious sovereign.
The applause continued so long that the comte had ample leisure to join the king.
"Nothing, however, has changed since then; on the contrary, indeed."
"Certainly not, sire; but your majesty did not tell me to remain."
The ballet began; the effect was more than beautiful.
"Entirely?"
"My affairs concern myself alone, monsieur; and I have already told you I transact them without interference."
The king felt himself color deeply, and said, "You are probably mistaken."
She, however, did not bestow a single glance upon him.
Their flattery pleased, as much as De Guiche's courage had astonished him, and he simply replied: "I did not tell you to return, comte."
"You will take them from my private treasure." Colbert bowed.
It must be suppressed."
Suddenly, for the purpose of restoring peace and order, Spring, accompanied by his whole court, made his appearance.
He has given them with too much grace not to have others still to give, if they are required, which is the case at the present moment.
Are you sure?"
Besides, the king's heart was filled with two or three new ideas; he had just derived fresh inspiration from the eloquent glances of Madame.
The king, who had from this moment become in reality the principal dancer in the quadrille, cast a look upon his vanquished rival.
"Nothing whatever," replied the courtier, as pale as death; "but your majesty has not thought of Fruits."
"But what?"
Her look had said to him: "Since they are jealous of you, divide their suspicions, for the man who distrusts two rivals does not object to either in particular." So that Madame, by this clever diversion, decided him.
As for the ballet itself, every person knew the part he had to take in it, and how to perform it.
"Well, sire, the colored lamps, the fireworks, the musicians, and the cooks, have swallowed up four millions in eight days."
"Seven hundred thousand francs, sire."
"Yes, sire; and ready dressed for the ballet."
The king seemed only pleased with every one present.
"Here?" replied the king, frowning, "here?
Louis turned hastily towards the side, and in fact, on his right, brilliant in his character of Autumn, De Guiche awaited until the king should look at him, in order that he might address him.
The Seasons, allies of Spring, followed him closely, to form a quadrille, which, after many words of more or less flattering import, was the commencement of the dance.
"Then, I perceive," said Colbert, trembling with anger and fear, "that I have had the misfortune to fall into disgrace with your majesty."
The news circulated with the rapidity of lightning; during its progress it kindled every variety of coquetry, desire, and wild ambition.
"To the last penny.
"Well?"
I did not wish to be the substance of so dark a shadow to your majesty's elegance, skill, and graceful invention; and I have left my tenants in order to place my services at your majesty's commands."
"Far from it, sire; your majesty having given no directions about it, the musicians have retained it."
He was dressed in a tunic of flowers, which set off his graceful and well formed figure to advantage.
"Why so?"
Every word fell distinctly, in perfect harmony and eloquence, upon Louis the fourteenth's ears.
De Guiche soon ceased to sustain even the character of the courtier; without applause, he danced indifferently, and very soon could not dance at all, by which accident the triumph of the king and of Madame was assured.
The theater represented a grove of trees; a few fauns lifting up their cloven feet were jumping about; a dryad made her appearance on the scene, and was immediately pursued by them; others gathered round her for her defense, and they quarrelled as they danced.
At the same moment, as if by enchantment, every one who knew how to hold a needle, every one who could distinguish a coat from a pair of trousers, was summoned to the assistance of those who had received invitations. The king had completed his toilette by nine o'clock; he appeared in an open carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers.
"And yet," he said, "your majesty did not use this language some time ago, when the news about Belle Isle arrived, for instance."
"But, come, since-"
The most beautiful pale lilac satin shoes, with bows of flowers and leaves, imprisoned his small feet.
His legs, the best shaped at court, were displayed to great advantage in flesh colored silken hose, of silk so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself.
"Certainly, sire; but I must have money to do that."
Disdainful of a success of which Madame showed no acknowledgement, he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the marked preference of the princess.
"I reserve your services for a better occasion; and believe me, they will only be the better appreciated."
The music, hautboys, flutes, and viols, was delightfully descriptive of rural delights.
"And," added Louis, "as it seems a difficult matter for you, notwithstanding your economy, to defray, with so limited a sum, the expenses which I intend to incur, I will at once sign an order for three millions."
The king had resolved to make it surprise.
His entrance produced, therefore, the most brilliant effect.
By degrees, as the sight became accustomed to so much brilliancy, the rarest beauties appeared to the view, as in the evening sky the stars appear one by one to him who closes his eyes and then opens them again.
It is necessary, therefore, that he should comply."
Such was the prince of that period: justly that evening styled "The King of all the Loves." There was something in his carriage which resembled the buoyant movements of an immortal, and he did not dance so much as seem to soar along.
When the music, by its bursts of melody, carried away these illustrious dancers, when the simple, untutored pantomime of that period, only the more natural on account of the very indifferent acting of the august actors, had reached its culminating point of triumph, the theater shook with tumultuous applause.
"So little is that the case, sire, that if your majesty will look to the right, you will see that the comte is in waiting."
Colbert," said he, accentuating the financier's name, "that is not the way I understood the matter; I do not wish to make use, against any of my servants, of a means of pressure which may oppress him and fetter his services.
The queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent dias or platform, erected upon the borders of the lake, in a theater of wonderful elegance of construction.
"Not at all; you are, on the contrary, most agreeable to me."
The king smiled upon De Guiche, who did not comprehend a word of Madame's dumb language, but he remarked that she pretended not to look at him, and he attributed the pardon which had been conferred upon him to the princess's kindness of heart.
The poor child lay senseless on the ground, bleeding profusely from his head.
The surgeon desired them not to talk to him, but leave him to repose.
Finally, to corroborate all the other indications, and confirm the truth of her discovery beyond all question, she counted the steps of the staircase leading from the room to the street, and found the number exactly what she had expected; for she had had the presence of mind to count them on the former occasion, when she descended them blindfold.
Many gentlemen followed him, greatly distressed at the sad accident which had befallen the general favourite; for it was soon on everybody's lips that the sufferer was little Luis.
The hopes her mother had given her of being his wife began to droop, and the fear came strong upon her that such bliss was not for one so luckless as herself.
The bed she too well remembered was there; and, above all, the cabinet, on which had stood the image she had taken away, was still on the same spot.
She told him that she would endeavour to marry him in conformity with his inclination, and that he need not make himself uneasy, for there would be no difficulty in breaking off the match which seemed so distasteful to him.
His grandfather and grandmother were so delighted with his grace, beauty, and good behaviour, that they came at last to regard their daughter's mischance as a happy event, since it had given them such a grandson.
Know then, son of my heart, that this fainting lady is your real bride: I say real, because she is the one whom your father and I have chosen for you, and the portrait was a pretence."
Her bearing was graceful and animated; she led her son by the hand, and before her walked two maids with wax lights and silver candlesticks.
The lady soon appeared, presenting a most charming spectacle of perfect beauty, set off by the most appropriate adornments.
He embraced and comforted Leocadia, kissed his grandson, and that same day he despatched a courier to Naples, with a letter to his son, requiring him to come home instantly, for his mother and he had concluded a suitable match for him with a very beautiful lady.
What you had best do, my child, is to keep it, and pray to it, that since it was a witness to your undoing, it will deign to vindicate your cause by its righteous judgment.
Rodolfo meanwhile having returned home, and having missed the crucifix, guessed who had taken it, but gave himself no concern about it.
This was done; for the event took place at a time when the consent of the parties was sufficient for the celebration of a marriage, without any of the preliminary formalities which are now so properly required.
Rodolfo thanked her, and supper being ready they went to join the rest of the party at table.
She counted the chairs and the cabinets, observed the position of the door, and also perceived some pictures hanging on the walls, but was not able to distinguish the subjects.
The master and mistress begged them not to cry, or raise their voices in lamentation; for it would do the little patient no good.
Among other things on which she cast her eyes was a small crucifix of solid silver, standing on a cabinet near the window.
They added that Rodolfo told them, on the following day, that he had carried the girl to his own apartment; and this was all they knew of the matter.
After a prosperous run of twelve days, he reached Barcelona, whence he posted in seven to Toledo, and entered his father's house, dressed in the very extreme of fashionable bravery.
Finally, the one party went off exulting, and the other was left in desolation and woe.
Go," she said to a servant, "and ask the senora.
Real dishonour consists in sin, and real honour in virtue.
"Unless you speak more fully, senora, I cannot understand you," replied her husband.
She meanwhile passed her life with her parents in the strictest retirement, never letting herself be seen, but shunning every eye lest it should read her misfortune in her face.
I am surprised at it myself; and I perceive that if great sorrows are sometimes dumb, they are sometimes eloquent. Be this as it may, grant me the favour I implore: it will cost you little.
The damask hangings were no longer there; but she recognised it by other tokens. She saw the grated window that opened on the garden: it was then closed on account of the little patient; but she asked if there was a garden on the outside, and was answered in the affirmative.
One day, when the boy was sent by his grandfather with a message to a relation, he passed along a street in which there was a great concourse of horsemen.
Let me not survive my disgrace!
All rose to do her reverence, as if something from heaven had miraculously appeared before them; but gazing on her, entranced with admiration, not one of them was able to address a single word to her.
The boy, who was named Luis after his grandfather, was remarkably handsome, of a sweet docile disposition; and his manners and deportment, even at that tender age, were such as showed him to be the son of some noble father.
Rodolfo had long contemplated a visit to Italy; and his father, who himself had been there, encouraged him in that design, telling him that no one could be a finished gentleman without seeing foreign countries.
This shocking news reached the ears of her parents, whom Dona Estafania had concealed in another room that they might make their appearance at the right moment.
She succeeded in opening the window; and the moonlight shone in so brightly, that she could distinguish the colour of some damask hangings in the room.
Rodolfo was now impatient to get rid of Leocadia, and made up his mind to lay her in the street, insensible as she was.
Time rolled on: the hour of her delivery arrived: it took place in the utmost secrecy, her mother taking upon her the office of midwife: and she gave birth to a son, one of the most beautiful ever seen.
She made all this known to her husband; and it was finally settled between the three that they should not move in the matter for the present, but wait till the will of Heaven had declared itself respecting the little patient.
"Base villain," she cried, "you took an infamous advantage of me when I had no more power to resist than a stock or a stone; but now that I have recovered my senses, you shall kill me before you shall succeed.
The boy found his recovery in this house; and I found in it reminiscences of events I shall never forget as long as I live.
In about half an hour, as it seemed to her, the door was opened; some one came in, blindfolded her, and taking her by the arm, without a word spoken, led her out of the room, which she heard him lock behind him.
He was greatly confused at finding that he had betrayed such emotion; but his mother, who guessed his thoughts, said to him, "Do not be ashamed, my son, at having been so overcome by your feelings; you would have been so still more had you known what I will no longer conceal from you, though I had intended to reserve it for a more joyful occasion.
On seeing his wife all in tears, and Leocadia fainting, he eagerly inquired the cause of so startling a spectacle.
At last they sat down to a merry supper to the sound of music, for the performers, who had been previously engaged, were now arrived.
Apathy and disgust commonly follow satiated lust.
The two parties, the sheep and the wolves, met each other. Rodolfo and his companions, with their faces muffled in their cloaks, stared rudely and insolently at the mother, the daughter, and the servant maid.
In spite of all their tenderness her anguish was too poignant to be soon allayed; and from that fatal night, she continued to live the life of a recluse under the protection of her parents.
The boy having embraced his mother, calling her his cousin, and his grandmother, calling her his benefactress, repeated his grandfather's question.
But, as the proverb says, with the disease God sends the remedy.
Whoever thou art," She exclaimed, suddenly seizing Rodolfo's hand, "if thy soul is capable of pity, grant me one prayer: having deprived me of honour, now deprive me of life.
There was in that city a young cavalier, about two and twenty years of age, whom wealth, high birth, a wayward disposition, inordinate indulgence, and profligate companions impelled to do things which disgraced his rank.
The father and mother, Rodolfo and his two companions had already seated themselves, when Dona Estafania said, in an off hand way, "Sinner that I am, how well I behave to my guest!
The gentleman who had humanely taken charge of him being of eminent rank, and well known, they easily found their way to his house, and arrived there just as Luis was under the surgeon's hands.
Luis was out of danger in a fortnight; in a month he rose from his bed; and during all that time he was visited daily by his mother and grandmother, and treated by the master and mistress of the house as if he was their own child.
The season being winter, she was dressed in a robe and train of black velvet, with gold and pearl buttons; her girdle and necklace were of diamonds; her head was uncovered, and the shining braids and ringlets of her thick chestnut hair, spangled with diamonds, dazzled the eyes of the beholders.
She reflected how near she stood to the crisis which was to determine whether she was to be blessed or unhappy for ever, and racked by the intensity of her emotions, she suddenly changed colour, her head dropped, and she fell forward in a swoon into the arms of the dismayed Estafania.
They had not undressed, or thought of taking any rest.
This truth which I have learned from her lips is confirmed by his face, in which we have both beheld that of our son."
Am I in bed?
What she had thus done voluntarily at first, she found herself, in a few months, constrained to do by necessity; for she discovered that she was pregnant, to the grievous renewal of her affliction.
As for high birth, thank Heaven and my ancestors I am well enough off in that respect; as for understanding, provided a woman is neither a dolt nor a simpleton, there is no need of her having a very subtle wit; in point of wealth, I am amply provided by my parents; but beauty is what I covet, with no other addition than virtue and good breeding.
But you must also swear not to follow me, or make any attempts to ascertain my name or that of my family, who if they were as wealthy as they are noble, would not have to bear patiently such insult in my person.
The four grandparents wept for joy: there was not a corner of the house but was full of gladness; and though night was hurrying on with her swift black wings, it seemed to Rodolfo that she did not fly, but hobble on crutches, so great was his impatience to be alone with his beloved bride.
The window was large, and protected by a stout iron grating: it looked out on a garden, surrounded by high walls, so that escape in that direction was as impossible as by the door.
The lady of the house spoke to the same effect, and with no less kindness and cordiality.
They were afraid to appeal for justice to the laws, lest thereby they should only publish their daughter's disgrace; besides, though well born they were poor, and had not the means of commanding influence and favour; and above all, they knew not the name of their injurer, or of whom or what to complain but their luckless stars.
In mercy kill me this moment!
But Rodolfo had been struck by the great beauty of Leocadia, the hidalgo's daughter, and presently he began to entertain the idea of enjoying it at all hazards.
Mother! dear father! do you hear me?
She earnestly entreated them to tell her, if they remembered that her son had carried off a young woman, on such a night, so many years ago; for the honour and the peace of mind of all his relations depended on their knowing the truth of that matter.
Just then Leocadia came to herself, and embracing the cross seemed changed into a sea of tears, and the gentleman remained in utter bewilderment, until his wife had repeated to him, from beginning to end, Leocadia's whole story; and he believed it, through the blessed dispensation of Heaven, which had confirmed it by so many convincing testimonies.
Having come to this resolution, he hastened back to remove Leocadia before daylight appeared, which would compel him to keep her in his room all the following day.
The gentleman replied that there was nothing to thank him for; the fact being, that when he saw the boy knocked down, his first thought was that he saw under the horses' heels the face of a son of his own, whom he tenderly loved.
For this and other reasons, Rodolfo readily complied with the wishes of his father, who gave him ample letters of credit on Barcelona, Genoa, Rome, and Naples.
If my wife brings me this, I will thank Heaven for the gift, and make my parents happy in their old age."
The news speedily reached the ears of his grandparents and his supposed cousin, who all hurried in wild dismay to look for their darling.
Rodolfo's two comrades proposed to take leave of him at once, and retire to their own homes; but Estafania would not suffer them to depart, for their presence was needful for the execution of a scheme she had in her head.
To baffle any spies that might perchance be watching her, she entered a house which she found open; and by and by she went from it to her own, where she found her parents stupefied with grief.
It was nearly night when Rodolfo arrived; and whilst preparations were making for supper, Estafania took her son's companions aside, believing that they were two of the three whom Leocadia mentioned as having been with Rodolfo on the night of her abduction.
Dona Estafania, the kind gentleman's wife, often observed, in conversation with Leocadia, that the boy so strongly resembled a son of hers who was in Italy, she never could look at him without thinking her son was actually before her.
It is the only amends I ask of you for the wrong you have done me."
"Once when I recovered from a swoon," replied Leocadia, "I found myself, senor, in your arms without honour; but for that I have had full compensation, since on my recovery from my this day's swoon I found myself in the same arms, but honoured.
You may wonder to hear me speak thus, being so young.
She found the door, but it was locked outside.
Burning with the thirst of personal revenge, Sheriff Jones now accused the town of Lawrence of the violation of law involved in this rescue, though the people of Lawrence immediately and earnestly disavowed the act.
With such a radical opposition of sentiment, both factions were on the alert to seize every available vantage ground.
He ordered the forces to disband; prisoners were liberated, and with the opportune aid of a furious rain storm the Border Ruffian army gradually melted away.
The free State men clung to their prairie towns and prairie ravines with all the obstinacy and courage of true defenders of their homes and firesides.
All the territorial dignitaries were present; Governor Shannon presided; john Calhoun, the Surveyor General, made the principal speech, a denunciation of the "abolitionists" supporting the Topeka movement; Chief Justice Lecompte dignified the occasion with approving remarks.
The military force, partly rabble, partly organized, had meanwhile moved into the town.
His reception speech at Westport, in which he maintained the legality of the Legislature, and his determination to enforce their laws, delighted his pro slavery auditors.
Organized and sustained in the beginning by voluntary contributions from that and distant States, they ended by levying forced contributions, by "pressing" horses, food, or arms from any neighborhood they chanced to visit.
"I have reason to believe," wrote one of their prominent men, "that before to morrow morning the black flag will be hoisted, when nine out of ten will rally round it, and march without orders upon Lawrence.
"We may have said that we would assist any proper officer in the service of any legal process," they replied, standing upon their interpretation.
In this incident, contrasting the creative and the destructive spirit of the factions, the Emigrant Aid Society of Massachusetts finds its most honorable and triumphant vindication.
Neither party was willing to yield honestly nor ready to fight manfully.
Meanwhile a sober second thought had come to Governor Shannon.
This was a formidable array of advantages; slavery was playing with loaded dice.
Atchison, who had been haranguing the mob, planted his two guns before the building and trained them upon it.
The firm defensive attitude of the people of Lawrence had produced its effect.
The irregular Border Ruffian squads were hastily incorporated into the skeleton "Kansas militia." The "posse" became some two thousand strong, and the defenders of Lawrence perhaps one thousand.
The Free State Hotel, a stone building in dimensions fifty by seventy feet, three stories high and handsomely furnished, previously occupied only for lodging rooms, on that day for the first time opened its table accommodations to the public, and provided a free dinner in honor of the occasion.
Buford, of Alabama; titus, of Florida; Wilkes, of Virginia; Hampton, of Kentucky; Treadwell, of South Carolina, and others, brought not only enthusiastic leadership, but substantial assistance. Both the factions which had come so near to actual battle in the "Wakarusa war," though nominally disbanded, in reality continued their military organizations,--the free State men through apprehension of danger, the Border Ruffians because of their purpose to crush out opposition.
The Missouri cabal, on the other hand, having three of their best men constantly at the Governor's side, were compelled to recognize their lack of justification.
The bogus Legislature numbered thirty six members.
The vague and double meaning phrases of the Lawrence agreement furnished the earliest causes of a renewal of the quarrel.
There was no doubt of the earnestness of their purpose.
The truce patched up by this Lawrence treaty was of comparatively short duration.
The inmates being removed, at the appointed hour a few cannon balls were fired through the stone walls.
From these, again, sprang barricaded and fortified dwellings, camps and scouting parties, finally culminating in roving guerrilla bands, half partisan, half predatory.
They were not only well armed and supplied, but wrought up to the highest pitch of partisan excitement.
Alarm being given, Branson's free State neighbors, already exasperated at the murder, rose under the sudden instinct of self protection and rescued Branson from the sheriff and his posse that same night, though without other violence than harsh words.
Yankee ingenuity had invented a new kind of breech loading gun called "Sharps rifle." It was, in fact, the best weapon of its day.
"Now is the time to show game, and if we are defeated this time, the Territory is lost to the South," said the leaders.
Two abortive imitations of the Missouri Blue Lodges, set on foot during the summer by the free State men, provoked by the election invasion in March, furnished them a starting point for military organization.
During and after the contest over the speakership at Washington, each State Legislature became a forum of Kansas debate.
The free State men had only their convictions, their intelligence, their courage, and the moral support of the North; the conspiracy had its secret combination, the territorial officials, the Legislature, the bogus laws, the courts, the militia officers, the President, and the army.
All dissent, all non compliance, all hesitation, all mere silence even, were in their stronghold towns, like Leavenworth, branded as "abolitionism," declared to be hostility to the public welfare, and punished with proscription, personal violence, expulsion, and frequently death.
Their assumed character changed with their changing opportunities or necessities.
The forces of the Lecompton camp fully understand the plot and will fight under the same banner."
"But," he added with a significant oath, "boys, we will fight some time!" Thirteen of the captains in the Wakarusa camp were called together, and the situation was duly explained.
The Governor, on his part, becoming doubtful of the legality of employing Missouri militia to enforce Kansas laws, was also eager to secure the help of Federal troops. Sheriff Jones began to grow importunate.
The United States Arsenal at Liberty, Missouri, was broken into and stripped of its contents to supply cannon, small arms, and ammunition.
Half an hour later, turning a deaf ear to all remonstrance, he gave the proprietors until five o'clock to remove their families and personal property from the Free State Hotel.
To these an urgent appeal for help was made; and the leaders of the conspiracy in prompt obedience placarded the frontier with inflammatory handbills, and collected and equipped companies, and hurried them forward to the rendezvous without a moment's delay.
There were similar murmurs in the pro slavery camps.
Ten days were consumed in these negotiations; but the spirit of vengeance refused to yield.
To embarrass this damaging exposure, Judge Lecompte issued a writ against the ex Governor on a frivolous charge of contempt.
In a few days an officer came with a requisition from Governor Shannon, and took the prisoner by land to Westport, and afterwards from there to Kansas City and Leavenworth.
With this peace warrant in his pocket, but without showing or reading it to his prisoner, Sheriff Jones and a posse of twenty five Border Ruffians proceeded to Branson's house at midnight and arrested him.
Opportunely for them, about this time Governor Shannon, appointed to succeed Reeder, arrived in the Territory.
The Governor refused to interfere to protect the threatened town, though an urgent appeal to do so was made to him by its citizens, who after stormy and divided councils resolved on a policy of non resistance.
[Relocated Footnote: Governor Robinson being on his way East, the steamboat on which he was traveling stopped at Lexington, Missouri.
In the Missouri camp while the leaders became alarmed the men grew insubordinate.
Coming by way of the Missouri River towns, he fell first among Border Ruffian companionship and influences; and perhaps having his inclinations already molded by his Washington instructions, his early impressions were decidedly adverse to the free State cause.
He continued his pretended search and, to give color to his errand, made two arrests.
Ex Governor Reeder was in attendance on this committee, supplying data, pointing out from personal knowledge sources of information, cross examining witnesses to elicit the hidden truth.
One of his militia generals suggested that the Governor should require the "outlaws at Lawrence and elsewhere" to surrender the Sharps rifles; another wrote asking him to call out the Government troops at Fort Leavenworth.
The Missouri backwoods men manifested an almost incredible interest in this wonderful gun.
But the affair was magnified as a crowning proof that the free State men were insurrectionists and outlaws.
They, on the other hand, professing no purpose but that of defense and self protection, were obliged to permit free and constant ingress to their beleaguered town.
The leaders of the conspiracy became distrustful of their power to crush the town.
The people of Lawrence denounced the deed; but the sheriff hoarded up the score for future revenge.
The free State men shrank from forcible resistance to even bogus laws.
This was, of course, the original controversy-slavery burning to enforce her usurpation, freedom determined to defend her birthright.
He hastened to Lawrence, which now invoked his protection.
The Free State Hotel served as barracks.
The murderer, a pro slavery man, first fled, to Missouri, but returned to Shawnee Mission and sought the official protection of Sheriff Jones; no warrant, no examination, no commitment followed, and the criminal remained at large.
A Border Ruffian foray against the town was hastily organized.
Of the lynchings, the mobs, and the murders, it would be impossible, except in a very extended work, to note the frequent and atrocious details.
The general public interest in the controversy was shown by discussions carried on by press, pulpit, and in the daily conversation and comment of the people of the Union in every town, hamlet, and neighborhood.
On one point especially the Border Ruffians had a wholesome dread.
While the Governor's proclamation spoke of serving writs, the notices of the conspirators sounded the note of the real contest.
With the advantage of its defensive position, Lawrence was as strong as the sheriff's mob.
President Pierce, in his special message of january twenty fourth, declared what had been done by the Topeka movement to be "of a revolutionary character" which would "become treasonable insurrection if it reach the length of organized resistance."
No posse was summoned, no further effort made, and Reeder, fearing personal violence, soon fled in disguise.
They could see that a conflict meant serious results.
This was at the March election, eighteen fifty five.
Governor Robinson and Colonel Lane were appointed to command.
Sheriff Jones made several visits unmolested on their part, and without any display of writs or demand for the surrender of alleged offenders on his own.
He directed his militia generals to repress disorder and check any attack on the town. Interviews were held with the free State commanders, and the situation was fully discussed.
Among other instrumentalities for executing the bogus laws, the bogus Legislature had appointed one Samuel j Jones sheriff of Douglas county kansas Territory, although that individual was at the time of his appointment, and long afterwards, United States postmaster of the town of Westport, Missouri.
One additional incident served to precipitate the crisis.
They might be deaf to the "equalities" proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence or blind to the moral sin of slavery, but they comprehended a rifle which could be fired ten times a minute and kill a man at a thousand yards.
A propitious moment for carrying it out seemed now to have arrived.
CIVIL WAR IN KANSAS
They next made application to the marshal, who tauntingly replied that he could not rely on their pledges, and must take the liberty to execute his process in his own time and manner.
Out of this incident, the officious sheriff managed most ingeniously to create an embroilment with the town of Lawrence, Buckley, who was alleged to have been accessory to the crime, obtained a peace warrant against Branson, a neighbor of the victim.
The free State officers and leaders were, thanks to Judge Lecompte's doctrine of constructive treason, under indictment, arrest, or in flight; the settlers were busy with their spring crops; while the pro slavery guerrillas, freshly arrived and full of zeal, were eager for service and distinction.
They were squads of Kansas militia, companies of "peaceful emigrants," or gangs of irresponsible outlaws, to suit the chance, the whim, or the need of the moment.
The people of Lawrence, without any great difficulty, obtained daily information concerning the hostile camps.
Their distinctive characters, however, display one broad and unfailing difference.
For general service, therefore, requiring no special effort, the numerical strength of the factions was about equal; while on extraordinary occasions the two thousand Border Ruffian reserve lying a little farther back from the State line could at any time easily turn the scale.
During the forenoon the deputy marshal rode leisurely into the town attended by less than a dozen men, being neither molested nor opposed. He summoned half a dozen citizens to join his posse, who followed, obeyed, and assisted him.
They consented to a compromise "to cover a retreat."
The Governor was denounced as a traitor, and Sheriff Jones declared that "he would have wiped out Lawrence." Atchison, on the contrary, sustained the bargain, explaining that to attack Lawrence under the circumstances would ruin the Democratic cause.
The bogus laws having been enacted, and the free State men having, at the Big Springs Convention, resolved on the failure of peaceable remedies to resist them to a "bloody issue," the conspiracy was not slow to cover itself and its projects with the sacred mantle of authority.
The marshal and his posse, including Sheriff Jones, went among other invited guests and enjoyed the proffered hospitality.
Faithful to their legislative declaration they knew but one issue, slavery.
That summer's emigration, however, being mainly from the free States, greatly changed the relative strength of the two parties.
Little by little, however, the latter became hemmed and bound in the meshes of the various devices and proceedings which the territorial officials evolved from the bogus laws.
The pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away, but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain.
Thus they seem to constitute more than the mere furniture of the mind; they form, as it were, almost a part of the structure itself.
You have made a life-long change, if not in the very structure, at least in the permanent furnishing of her mind, and performed a work that can never by any possibility be undone.
Every story, therefore, which you relate to a child to exemplify the principles of justice or goodness takes its place, or, rather, the impression which it makes takes its place, as one of the elements out of which the ideas that are to govern his future life are formed.
Every strong impression which you make upon his perceptive powers must have a very lasting influence, and even the impression itself may, in some cases, be forever indelible.
We can not surrender this trust.
They are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood.
The images which have been awakened in her mind, the emotions connected with them, and the effect of these images and emotions upon her faculties of imagination and conception, will infuse a life into them which will make her, in respect to this aspect of her spiritual nature, a different being as long as she lives.
CONCLUSION.
For the ideas and generalizations thus mainly formed from the images and impressions received in childhood become, in later years, the elements of the machinery, so to speak, by which all his mental operations are performed.
"Mary, your father and I are going out to ride this afternoon, and I am going to explain it all to you why you can not go too.
She brings down her bonnet and shawl by stealth, and before the chaise comes to the door she sends Mary out into the garden with her sister, under pretense of showing her a bird's nest which is not there, trusting to her sister's skill in diverting the child's mind, and amusing her with something else in the garden, until the chaise has gone.
In respect to her statement that she was going to the doctor's, it may, or may not, have been true.
one.
THE THREE MODES OF MANAGEMENT.
Then, if she observes any expression of discontent or insubmission in Mary's countenance, the mother would add,
A child, even, who has become once accustomed to them, will soon drop them if she finds, owing to a change in the system of management, that they now never succeed.
They are,
three.
You love mamma, I am sure, and wish to have her get well soon. So you will be a good girl, I know, and not make any trouble, but will stay at home contentedly-won't you?
There are three different modes of management customarily employed by parents as means of inducing their children to comply with their requirements.
And a child who never, from the beginning, finds any efficiency in them, never learns to employ them at all.
The object of this work is, accordingly, not to show how the gentle methods which will be brought to view can be employed as a substitute for such authority, but how they can be made to aid in establishing and maintaining it.
By the third method the mother secures the compliance of the child by a direct exercise of authority.
Government by Manoeuvring and Artifice.
Those children only attempt to carry their points by noisy and violent demonstrations who find, by experience, that such measures are usually successful.
But the influences secured by these means form, at the best, but a sandy foundation for filial obedience to rest upon.
The mother, in managing the case in this way, relies partly on convincing the reason of the child, and partly on an appeal to her affection.
By Authority.
As the chaise drives away, Mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the door step, her mind in a tumult of excitement, in which hatred of the doctor, distrust and suspicion of her mother, disappointment, vexation, and ill humor, surge and swell among those delicate organizations on which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend-doing perhaps an irreparable injury.
Many mothers manage their children by means of tricks and contrivances, more or less adroit, designed to avoid direct issues with them, and to beguile them, as it were, into compliance with their wishes.
By Reason and Affection.
To suppose that the object of this work is to aid in effecting such a substitution as that, is entirely to mistake its nature and design.
"Why can't you take me?" asks Mary.
"I can not tell you why, now," replies the mother, "but perhaps I will explain it to you after I come home.
Then I shall love you, and your papa will love you, and after I get well we will take you to ride with us some day."
The theory of many mothers is that they must govern their children by the influence of reason and affection.
"Mary, your father and I are going out to ride this afternoon, and I am sorry, for your sake, that we can not take you with us."
"There!" said she, pointing to the playthings; "see! all your playthings left out!
I would not have them know that their mothers leave their playthings about in that way for any consideration.
But being addressed to the dolls, they would be greatly interested in it, and would listen with the utmost attention; and there is no doubt that the counsels and instructions which she gave made a much stronger impression upon their minds than if they had been addressed directly to the children themselves. To give an idea of these conversations I will report one of them in full.
Delia was accustomed to use the dolls not only for the purpose of instruction, but sometimes for reproof, in many ingenious ways.
And you don't look very well now.
Put these playthings all away quick, and carefully, and we will not let them know any thing about your leaving them out."
They were now playing with their dolls in the parlor.
Besides dressing and undressing them, and playing take them out to excursions and visits, they used to talk with them a great deal, and give them much useful and valuable information and instruction.
To such persons, these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will, or rather of yielding to their influence, are specially useful.
This book may, perhaps, sometimes fall into the hands of persons who have, temporarily or otherwise, the charge of young children without any absolute authority over them, or any means, or even any right, to enforce their commands, as was the case, in fact, with the older brothers or sister referred to in the preceding illustrations.
They would think that they might do so too, and that would make you a great deal of trouble.
"How do you do, my children?" she said, on one such occasion.
Nothing more was necessary except to shake up the mixture in order to facilitate the process of solution, and the medicine was ready.
For instance, one day the children had been playing upon the piazza with blocks and other playthings, and finally had gone into the house, leaving all the things on the floor of the piazza, instead of putting them away in their places, as they ought to have done.
There is a secret-something I would not have them know on any account."
Now Delia contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendency over the minds of the children by means of these dolls.
And this method of treating the case was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any direct rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been.
"Ah!" said Della in a tone of great concern, and looking again at Andella, "I heard that you had been sick.
DELLA AND THE DOLLS.
If Delia had attempted to give precisely the same lecture to the children themselves, they would very soon have become restless and uneasy, and it would have made very little impression upon them.
I observe that, when you both wish for the same thing, you don't quarrel for it and try to pull it away from one another; but one waits like a lady until the other has done with it.
Put them away quick before Andella and Rosalie see them.
I want you to come with me.
So saying, she led the way on tiptoe, followed by the children out of the room, and round by a circuitous route to the piazza.
Such persons may be interested in the manner in which Delia made use of the children's dolls as a means of guiding and governing their little mothers.
You will have a very pleasant time, I am sure; because you never quarrel.
If you can lead children to cure themselves of their faults in such a way that they shall have a good time in doing it, there is a double gain.
Then, turning to Jane, she asked, in a somewhat altered tone, "Has she been a good girl, Jane?"
You have come, Andella (Andella was the name of Jane's doll), to make Rosalie a visit.
I am very glad.
So the children went to work with great alacrity, and put the playthings all away.
How nice you look!
Besides, a scolding would have made them unhappy, and this did not make them unhappy at all; it amused and entertained them.
"Well, but now?" said the Princess; and she filled his pockets with cakes, and put her own heavy gold chain around his neck, and bent down and kissed him.
And so he did.
But when one has a fine red cap with a blue tassel, one is too fine to ride on peat loads, and Anders trotted proudly by.
He only shook his head.
He knew well enough that mother's cap was the best cap in all the world.
He cuddled up to his mother and asked:
"I am going to the court ball," answered Anders.
He smiled when he saw Anders in the gilt chair.
"And it is made of mother's best yarn, and she knitted it herself, and everybody wants to get it away from me."
Then Anders felt brave again.
"Let's swap caps," he said, "and I will give you my jack knife to boot."
The first person he met was a farm labourer walking alongside a load of peat and smacking at his horse.
He made a bow so deep that his back came near breaking, and he was dumbfounded, I can tell you, when he saw it was nobody but Anders.
But his mother hugged him close.
"If you dressed in silk and gold from top to toe, you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap."
"Seeing that I am so fine, I may as well go and visit the King."
Anders did not answer.
When she became aware of Anders and the soldiers, she walked over to them.
But he had his cap. He still held on to it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage.
On huge silver platters were pyramids of tarts and cakes, and red wine sparkled in glittering decanters.
Once upon a time there was a little boy, called Anders, who had a new cap.
Then the doors were thrown open, and the King entered with a large suite of gentlemen in glittering uniforms and plumed hats.
"Mother, was I stupid?"
He darted like an arrow through all the halls, down all the stairs, and across the yard.
"But surely you would like to change caps with me," said the King, and raised his large, heavy gold crown from his head.
And a prettier cap you never could see, for mother herself had knitted it, and nobody could make anything quite as nice as mother could.
And all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open.
The Princess sat down under a blue canopy with bouquets of roses; and she let Anders sit in a golden chair by her side.
"Dear me," he said, "if I did not think it was the gracious little count himself." And then he invited Anders to ride on the peat load.
But when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a King's golden crown, he said that Anders was a stupid.
"So it is," said Anders.
For, like as not, they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap.
Now this knife was a splendid one, though half the blade was gone, and the handle was a little cracked; and Anders knew that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jack knife.
The Princess certainly was beautiful, and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her, but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any condition.
He sat as before, and held on to his red cap which everybody was so anxious to get.
But Anders cared nothing about that.
"That is a very fine cap you have," he said.
And then he said good bye to Lars with a nod; but Lars only made faces at him, for he was very much put out because he could not cheat Anders out of his cap which his mother had made.
He put his hands in his trousers pockets and went out for a walk, for he did not begrudge anybody's seeing how fine he was.
He was such a big boy that he wore high boots and carried a jack knife. He gazed and gazed at the cap, and could not keep from fingering the blue tassel.
"Well, well, give it to me," said the Princess, "and I will give you a kiss."
She called him a little gentleman and said that he was so fine that he might go to the royal court ball.
But just at this instant the Princess came tripping across the yard. She was dressed in white silk with bows of ribbon.
His brothers and sisters walked about squinting at him, and their faces grew long with envy.
He ran so fast that the Princess's necklace fell off his neck, and all the cakes jumped out of his pockets.
In the palace yard stood two soldiers with shining helmets, and with muskets over their shoulders; and when Anders came, both the muskets were levelled at him.
"Oh," she said, "he has such an extraordinarily fine cap on his head, that that will do just as well as a uniform."
"But you must not eat with your cap on your head," she said, and was going to take it off.
With one jump Anders got out of his chair.
He twisted himself like an eel between the outstretched arms of the courtiers, and over the soldiers' muskets he jumped like a little rabbit.
That he had not thought of.
At the turn of the road he ran up against the tanner's boy, Lars.
"Where may you be going?" asked one of the soldiers.
"Yes, why not?" thought Anders.
And his mother took him up in her lap, and he told her all his adventures, and how everybody wanted his cap.
"Indeed you are not," said the other soldier, and put his foot forward.
At the farther end of the largest hall a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rows.
He hated everything like Slavery, and as young as he was, he had already made five attempts to escape.
I never knew of but one man who could ever please him.
Julius had been kept in the dark in Maryland, but on free soil, the light rushed in upon his astonished vision to a degree almost bewildering.
He worked me very hard; he wanted to be beating me all the time."
The treatment that had been meted out to them was about as tolerant as Slavery could well afford; and the physical condition of the passengers bore evidence that they had been used to something better than herring and corn cake for a diet.
I was afraid of being overtaken on the way." He fled from near Baltimore, where he left brothers and other relatives in chains.
These were specimens of the inner workings of the peculiar institution. john, however, had not only observed Slavery from a domestic stand point, he had also watched master and mistress abroad as visitors and guests in other people's houses, noticed not only how they treated white people, but also how they treated black people.
john Wesley was thirty two years of age, of a lively turn, pleasant countenance, dark color, and ordinary size.
Julius, who was successful enough to bring his wife and boy with him, was a wonderful specimen of muscular proportions.
In his review allusion was made not only to his master, but also to his mistress, in which he said that she was "a quarrelsome and crabbed woman, middling stout." In order to show a reason why he left as he did, he stated that "there had been a fuss two or three times" previous to the escape, and it had been rumored "that somebody would have to be sold soon."
Julius' color was nearly jet black, and his speech was very good considering his lack of book learning; his bearing was entirely self possessed and commendable.
JULIUS SMITH, WIFE MARY, AND BOY james, HENRY AND EDWARD SMITH, AND JACK CHRISTY.
ARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND, eighteen fifty eight.
I always had it in my mind to leave, but I was 'jubus', (dubious?) of starting.
j b Parlett's advertisement, gave his views of the man who had enslaved him.
A few years back one of their slaves, a coachman, was kept on the coach box one cold night when they were out at a ball until he became almost frozen to death, in fact he did die in the infirmary from the effects of the frost about one week afterwards."
Nor was he all muscle by a great deal; he was well balanced as to mother wit and shrewdness.
Of this party, Edward, a boy of seventeen, called forth much sympathy; he too was claimed by Hollan.
"Another case was that of a slave woman in a very delicate state, who was one day knocked down stairs by mrs Johnson herself, and in a few weeks after, the poor woman died from the effects of the injury thus received.
When asked what first prompted him to seek his freedom, he replied, "Oh my senses!
two thousand dollars REWARD.--Ran away from the subscriber, living on the York Turnpike, eight miles from Baltimore city, on sunday april eleventh, my negro man, JACOB, aged twenty years: five feet ten inches high; chestnut color; spare made; good features.
I didn't know the way to come.
The mistress professed to know nothing about it, simply said, 'she went to sleep and fell out herself.' As usual nothing was done in the way of punishment."
The revelations made by these passengers were painful to listen to, and would not have been credited if any room had existed for doubt.
It is hardly necessary to say more of them here.
I will give fifty dollars reward if taken in Baltimore city or county, and two hundred dollars if taken out of the State and secured in jail so that I get him again.
Henry was about twenty three years of age, of an active turn, brown skin, and had given the question of freedom his most serious attention, as his actions proved.
While this party was very respectable in regard to numbers and enlisted much sympathy, still they had no wounds or bruises to exhibit, or very hard reports to make relative to their bondage.
Although a young man, of but twenty five, he weighed two hundred and twenty five pounds; he was tall and well formed from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet.
As to advertising him, john gave it as his opinion that they would be ashamed to do it from the fact that they had already rendered themselves more notorious than they had bargained for, on account of their cruelty towards their slaves; they were wealthy, and courted the good opinion of society.
"These Johnsons thought that they were first rate to their servants.
On this occasion, with older and wiser heads, he succeeded.
For instance, Jacob Taylor was noticed on the record book as being twenty three years of age, and the name of his master was entered as "William Pollit;" but as Jacob had never been allowed to learn to read, he might have failed in giving a correct pronunciation of the name.
j b PARLETT.
Besides they were members of the Presbyterian Church, and john thought that they were very willing that people should believe that they were great saints.
With John's intelligence, large observation, good memory, and excellent natural abilities, with the amount of detail that he possessed, nothing more would have been needed for a thrilling book than the facts and incidents of slave life, as he had been conversant with it under the Johnsons in Maryland.
His wife and boy shared fully in his affections, and seemed well pleased to have their faces turned Canada ward.
From the manner in which he expressed himself, with regard to Robert Hollan, no man in the whole range of his recollections will be longer remembered than he; his enthralment while under Hollan will hardly ever be forgotten.
That his master was a man of "means and pretty high standing"--Julius thought was not much to his credit since they were obtained from unpaid labor.
This was what did the mischief so far as the "running away" was concerned.
Conseil was my manservant.
There the Katrin ferry transferred men, horses, and carriage to Brooklyn, that great New York annex located on the left bank of the East River, and in a few minutes we arrived at the wharf next to which the Abraham Lincoln was vomiting torrents of black smoke from its two funnels.
"Commander Farragut?"
"They'll feed it during our absence.
But Conseil had one flaw.
"Go ahead, then!" Commander Farragut called.
"What master does, I'll do," Conseil replied.
Conseil appeared.
"Whatever detour master wishes."
It's a glorious mission but also a dangerous one!
The hotel elevator dropped us off in the main vestibule on the mezzanine. I went down a short stair leading to the ground floor. I settled my bill at that huge counter that was always under siege by a considerable crowd.
But now nothing could hold me back. I forgot everything else, and without another thought of exhaustion, friends, or collections, I accepted the American government's offer.
A route slightly less direct, that's all. We're leaving on the Abraham Lincoln."
A quarter of an hour later, our trunks were ready.
A devoted lad who went with me on all my journeys; a gallant Flemish boy whom I genuinely liked and who returned the compliment; a born stoic, punctilious on principle, habitually hardworking, rarely startled by life's surprises, very skillful with his hands, efficient in his every duty, and despite his having a name that means "counsel," never giving advice- not even the unsolicited kind!
"We'll deal with them later."
"Besides," I mused, "all roads lead home to Europe, and our unicorn may be gracious enough to take me toward the coast of France!
Pack as much into my trunk as you can, my traveling kit, my suits, shirts, and socks, don't bother counting, just squeeze it all in-and hurry!"
Three seconds after reading this letter from the honorable Secretary of the Navy, I understood at last that my true vocation, my sole purpose in life, was to hunt down this disturbing monster and rid the world of it.
Get my things ready, get yours ready. We're departing in two hours."
"What about master's live babirusa?"
"As master thinks best," Conseil replied placidly.
"What about master's collections?" Conseil ventured to observe.
"Professor Pierre Aronnax?" he said to me.
For the past ten years, Conseil had gone with me wherever science beckoned.
"Conseil!" I called in an impatient voice.
There was good reason to stop and think, even for the world's most emotionless man. What would Conseil say?
"Did master summon me?" he said, entering.
I left instructions for shipping my containers of stuffed animals and dried plants to Paris, France.
I asked for Commander Farragut.
These beasts can be quite unpredictable!
"The hotel will keep them for us."
We're going to rid the seas of it! The author of a two volume work, in quarto, on The Mysteries of the Great Ocean Depths has no excuse for not setting sail with Commander Farragut.
Your cabin is waiting for you."
"Aye, sir," the engineer replied.
Anyhow, we'll leave instructions to ship the whole menagerie to France."
At this order, which was relayed to the engine by means of a compressed air device, the mechanics activated the start-up wheel. Steam rushed whistling into the gaping valves.
"Conseil!" I called a third time.
"Then we aren't returning to Paris?" Conseil asked.
"Conseil!" I repeated, while feverishly beginning my preparations for departure.
"What!
"Are we up to pressure?" he asked the man.
The archaeotherium, hyracotherium, oreodonts, cheiropotamus, and master's other fossil skeletons?"
Three o'clock then sounded.
The lad was thirty years old, and his age to that of his employer was as fifteen is to twenty.
I opened a line of credit sufficient to cover the babirusa and, Conseil at my heels, I jumped into a carriage.
CHAPTER three
"With all due respect to master," Conseil replied, "as comfortable as a hermit crab inside the shell of a whelk."
"The same," I replied.
I left Conseil to the proper stowing of our luggage and climbed on deck to watch the preparations for getting under way.
I wanted nothing more than to see my country again, my friends, my modest quarters by the Botanical Gardens, my dearly beloved collections!
"In person.
Our baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate. I rushed aboard.
"Oh, it's nothing really!
"We haven't a moment to lose.
"Yes, my boy.
It was a high-speed frigate furnished with superheating equipment that allowed the tension of its steam to build to seven atmospheres.
From rubbing shoulders with scientists in our little universe by the Botanical Gardens, the boy had come to know a thing or two. In Conseil I had a seasoned specialist in biological classification, an enthusiast who could run with acrobatic agility up and down the whole ladder of branches, groups, classes, subclasses, orders, families, genera, subgenera, species, and varieties. But there his science came to a halt.
I bowed, and letting the commander attend to getting under way, I was taken to the cabin that had been set aside for me.
The wharves of Brooklyn, and every part of New York bordering the East River, were crowded with curiosity seekers. Departing from five hundred thousand throats, three cheers burst forth in succession. Thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses, hailing the Abraham
Even so, I had just returned from an arduous journey, exhausted and badly needing a rest.
"As master wishes."
He summoned his engineer.
Under this pressure the Abraham Lincoln reached an average speed of eighteen point three miles per hour, a considerable speed but still not enough to cope with our gigantic cetacean.
The Abraham Lincoln had been perfectly chosen and fitted out for its new assignment.
Welcome aboard, professor.
Never did he object to buckling up his suitcase for any country whatever, China or the Congo, no matter how far off it was. He went here, there, and everywhere in perfect contentment. Moreover, he enjoyed excellent health that defied all ailments, owned solid muscles, but hadn't a nerve in him, not a sign of nerves- the mental type, I mean.
"Yes, we are . . . certainly . . . ," I replied evasively, "but after we make a detour."
Lincoln until it reached the waters of the Hudson River, at the tip of the long peninsula that forms New York City.
Conseil did them in a flash, and I was sure the lad hadn't missed a thing, because he classified shirts and suits as expertly as birds and mammals.
We don't know where it will take us!
THREE SECONDS before the arrival of j b Hobson's letter, I no more dreamed of chasing the unicorn than of trying for the Northwest Passage.
To be sure, I had confidence in this devoted lad.
As Master Wishes
The escort of boats and tenders still followed the frigate and only left us when we came abreast of the lightship, whose two signal lights mark the entrance of the narrows to Upper New York Bay.
He was a fanatic on formality, and he only addressed me in the third person-to the point where it got tiresome.
KNOT one point one five miles per hour
HECTARE Roughly two point five acres
But in the eighteen sixties France had to treat the Tsar as an ally, and Verne's publisher Pierre Hetzel pronounced the book unprintable. Verne reworked its political content, devising new nationalities for Nemo and his great enemy-information revealed only in a later novel, The Mysterious Island (eighteen seventy five); in the present work Nemo's background remains a dark secret.
Yet this loose structure gives the novel an air of documentary realism.
Other subtleties occur inside each episode, the textures sparkling with wit, information, and insight.
METER Roughly one yard, three inches
Even the supporting cast is shrewdly drawn: Professor Aronnax, the career scientist caught in an ethical conflict; Conseil, the compulsive classifier who supplies humorous tag lines for Verne's fast facts; the harpooner Ned Land, a creature of constant appetites, man as heroic animal.
FATHOM six feet
But with Verne the operative word is "travel," and some of his best known titles don't really qualify as scifi: Around the World in Eighty Days (eighteen seventy two) and Michael Strogoff (eighteen seventy six) are closer to "travelogs"-- adventure yarns in far away places.
"The deepest parts of the ocean are totally unknown to us," admits Professor Aronnax early in this novel.
Like Shakespeare's King Lear he courts death and madness in a great storm, then commits mass murder, collapses in catatonic paralysis, and suicidally runs his ship into the ocean's most dangerous whirlpool. Hate swallows him whole.
one hundred degrees centigrade equals boiling water
of the Earth features travel to the earth's core.
First as a Paris stockbroker, later as a celebrated author and yachtsman, he went on frequent voyages- to Britain, America, the Mediterranean.
True, today's scientists know a few things he didn't: the South Pole isn't at the water's edge but far inland; sharks don't flip over before attacking; giant squid sport ten tentacles not eight; sperm whales don't prey on their whalebone cousins.
Verne is often dubbed, in Isaac Asimov's phrase, "the world's first science fiction writer." And it's true, many of his sixty odd books do anticipate future events and technologies: From the Earth to the Moon (eighteen sixty five) and Hector Servadac (eighteen seventy seven) deal in space travel, while Journey to the Center
But much of the novel's brooding power comes from Captain Nemo. Inventor, musician, Renaissance genius, he's a trail blazing creation, the prototype not only for countless renegade scientists in popular fiction, but even for such varied figures as Sherlock Holmes or Wolf Larsen.
Units of Measure
These observations partly apply here.
His specifications for an open sea submarine and a self-contained diving suit were decades before their time, yet modern technology bears them out triumphantly.
And in this last action he falls into the classic sin of Pride.
The subtitle of the present book is An Underwater Tour of the World, so in good travelog style, the Nautilus's exploits supply an episodic story line. Shark attacks, giant squid, cannibals, hurricanes, whale hunts, and other rip roaring adventures erupt almost at random.
However, Verne gives his hero's brilliance and benevolence a dark underside-the man's obsessive hate for his old enemy.
LEAGUE In Verne's context, two point one six miles
CABLE LENGTH In Verne's context, six hundred feet
- MILLIGRAM Roughly one twenty eight thousandth of an ounce
one hundred twenty six years later, a Time cover story on deep-sea exploration made much the same admission: "We know more about Mars than we know about the oceans." This reality begins to explain the dark power and otherworldly fascination of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas.
Initially, Verne's narrative was influenced by the eighteen sixty three uprising of Poland against Tsarist Russia.
- MILLIMETER Roughly one twenty fifth of an inch
And Verne's marine engineering proves especially authoritative.
Even in our era of satellite dishes and video games, the seas keep their secrets.
CENTIGRADE zero degrees centigrade equals freezing water
The Poles were quashed with a violence that appalled not only Verne but all Europe.
Lastly the book has stature as a novel of character.
thirty seven degrees centigrade equals human body temperature
Because, as that Time cover story suggests, we still haven't caught up with Verne.
This compulsion leads Nemo into ugly contradictions: he's a fighter for freedom, yet all who board his ship are imprisoned there for good; he works to save lives, both human and animal, yet he himself creates a holocaust; he detests imperialism, yet he lays personal claim to the South Pole.
- KILOMETER Roughly six tenths of a mile
LITER Roughly one quart
"What goes on in those distant depths?
This notwithstanding, Verne furnishes the most evocative portrayal of the ocean depths before the arrival of Jacques Cousteau and technicolor film.
We've seen progress in sonar, torpedoes, and other belligerent machinery, but sailors and scientists- to say nothing of tourists-have yet to voyage in a submarine with the luxury and efficiency of the Nautilus.
What creatures inhabit, or could inhabit, those regions twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the water? It's almost beyond conjecture."
- CENTIMETER Roughly two fifths of an inch
These unifying threads tighten the narrative and accelerate its momentum.
The feeling of familiarity has all sorts of degrees, down to the stage where we dimly feel that we have seen a person before.
In the first place, everything constituting a memory belief is happening now, not in that past time to which the belief is said to refer.
It might, however, have been expected that we should begin our discussion of knowledge with PERCEPTION, i e with that integral experience of things in the environment, out of which sensation is extracted by psychological analysis.
That is to say if we suppose that A is the event remembered, B the remembering, and t the interval of time between A and B, there must be some characteristic of B which is capable of degrees, and which, in accurately dated memories, varies as t varies. It may increase as t increases, or diminish as t increases.
In an image of a well-known face, for example, some parts may feel more familiar than others; when this happens, we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts.
The FACT of past experience is essential in producing this filling out of sensation, but not the RECOLLECTION of past experience.
And it is difficult to find any ground, except a pragmatic one, for supposing that memory is not sheer delusion, if, as seems to be the case, there is not, apart from memory, any way of ascertaining that there really was a past occurrence having the required relation to our present remembering.
There may be a specific feeling which could be called the feeling of "pastness," especially where immediate memory is concerned.
The behaviourist, who attempts to make psychology a record of behaviour, has to trust his memory in making the record.
In the second place, images without beliefs are insufficient to constitute memory; and habits are still more insufficient.
This distinction is vital to the understanding of memory.
Thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone.
When we see a cat, we know it is a cat because of previous cats we have seen, but we do not, as a rule, recollect at the moment any particular occasion when we have seen a cat.
Familiarity is a feeling capable of degrees.
It might be suggested that vagueness is the required characteristic, but I do not think this is the case.
There is, of course, a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present, and knowing the time order of two remembered events.
I think the characteristic by which we distinguish the images we trust is the feeling of FAMILIARITY that accompanies them.
We may say, then, that images are regarded by us as more or less accurate copies of past occurrences because they come to us with two sorts of feelings: (one) Those that may be called feelings of familiarity; (two) those that may be collected together as feelings giving a sense of pastness.
One reason for treating memory at this early stage is that it seems to be involved in the fact that images are recognized as "copies" of past sensible experience.
The non sensational elements in perception can be wholly explained as the result of habit, produced by frequent correlations.
It would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present, but it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events.
They must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past.
But it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory. Habit is a very intrusive feature of our mental life, and is often present where at first sight it seems not to be.
Semon's two books, mentioned in an earlier lecture, do not touch knowledge memory at all closely.
Hence the occurrences which are CALLED knowledge of the past are logically independent of the past; they are wholly analysable into present contents, which might, theoretically, be just what they are even if no past had existed.
The definition of truth as the correspondence between beliefs and facts seems peculiarly evident in the case of memory, as against not only the pragmatist definition but also the idealist definition by means of coherence.
To begin with, it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as "I have seen this before" than as "this has existed before." We recognize a thing (it may be urged) as having been in our experience before, whatever that may mean; we do not recognize it as merely having been in the world before.
What results, formally, from our knowledge of the past through images of which we recognize the inaccuracy, is that such images must have two characteristics by which we can arrange them in two series, of which one corresponds to the more or less remote period in the past to which they refer, and the other to our greater or less confidence in their accuracy.
For their mere occurrence, by itself, would not suggest any connection with anything that had happened before.
All that I am doing is to use its logical tenability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember.
The sort of memory with which we are here concerned is the sort which is a form of knowledge.
It seems clear that some of the things I remember are trivial and without any visible importance for the future, but that my memory is true (or false) in virtue of a past event, not in virtue of any future consequences of my belief.
Before considering true memory, it will be well to consider two things which are on the way towards memory, namely the feeling of familiarity and recognition.
MEMORY
A third point, perhaps not quite so certain as our previous two, is that the truth of memory cannot be wholly practical, as pragmatists wish all truth to be.
The fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it.
Similarly, the performances of animals in getting out of cages or mazes to which they are accustomed do not prove that they remember having been in the same situation before. Arguments in favour of (for example) memory in plants are only arguments in favour of habit memory, not of knowledge memory.
In such a case we distrust our image in spite of its being unusually clear.
In the present lecture I shall attempt the analysis of memory knowledge, both as an introduction to the problem of knowledge in general, and because memory, in some form, is presupposed in almost all other knowledge.
The judgment that what is familiar has been experienced before is a product of reflection, and is no part of the feeling of familiarity, such as a horse may be supposed to have when he returns to his stable.
Of course, the words "this has existed before" are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition, but that is unavoidable: words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive, and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition.
How far our knowledge of the past is due to memory, and how far to other sources, is of course a matter to be investigated, but there can be no doubt that memory forms an indispensable part of our knowledge of the past.
Memory, which we are to consider to day, introduces us to knowledge in one of its forms.
But the rejection of the subject renders some more complicated theory necessary.
A recent memory has, usually, more context than a more distant one.
I think it is by this means that we become critical of images, not by some imageless memory with which we compare them.
There are occasions when familiarity does not attach itself to any definite object, when there is merely a vague feeling that SOMETHING is familiar.
We recognize our friend Jones, we know cats and dogs when we see them, and so on.
Remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling, or related to, what is remembered.
I am not suggesting that the non existence of the past should be entertained as a serious hypothesis.
Like all sceptical hypotheses, it is logically tenable, but uninteresting.
It is this sort of occurrence that constitutes the essence of memory Until we have analysed what happens in such a case as this, we have not succeeded in understanding memory.
What is called perception differs from sensation by the fact that the sensational ingredients bring up habitual associates-images and expectations of their usual correlates-all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation.
The analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the thirteenth lecture, and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise.
It is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge.
If we had retained the "subject" or "act" in knowledge, the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple.
This may be taken in two senses, the first when a thing not merely feels familiar, but we know it is such and such.
It is by no means always reliable; almost everybody has at some time experienced the well-known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time.
Sensation, we decided, is not a form of knowledge.
It is important not to confuse the two forms of memory which Bergson distinguishes in the second chapter of his "Matter and Memory," namely the sort that consists of habit, and the sort that consists of independent recollection.
They give laws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds, but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences, which is what constitutes knowledge memory.
I come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past.
And the same applies to images.
We will take the second of these points first.
Some images, like some sensations, feel very familiar, while others feel strange.
A further stage is RECOGNITION.
We are, of course, in fact able to judge, when we recognize an object, that we have seen it before, but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense, and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word.
One of these is context.
I shall return to the consideration of familiarity shortly.
We have this feeling normally in places where we have often been before-at home, or in well-known streets.
Thus, if I recognize a thing, the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which I recognize it forms part of "my experience" by DEFINITION: recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled out from the rest of the world.
We sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague, which yet we do not trust-for example, under the influence of fatigue we may see a friend's face vividly and clearly, but horribly distorted.
The first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past.
The purely psychological problems which it raises are not very difficult, though they have sometimes been rendered artificially obscure by unwillingness to admit the fallibility of the non sensational elements of perception.
The study of any topic is like the continued observation of an object which is approaching us along a road: what is certain to begin with is the quite vague knowledge that there is SOME object on the road.
Nevertheless, in spite of the risk of error, precision is the goal at which we must aim.
A gramophone, by the help of suitable records, might relate to us the incidents of its past; and people are not so different from gramophones as they like to believe.
I shall speak of it as "true" memory, to distinguish it from mere habit acquired through past experience.
This knowledge is memory in one sense, though in another it is not.
It is not logically necessary to the existence of a memory belief that the event remembered should have occurred, or even that the past should have existed at all.
There is no logically necessary connection between events at different times; therefore nothing that is happening now or will happen in the future can disprove the hypothesis that the world began five minutes ago.
When we have once described the event, the words we have used easily become habitual.
It differs from the sense of familiarity by being cognitive; it is a belief or judgment, which the sense of familiarity is not.
There is, for example, a habit of remembering a unique event.
How, then, are we to find any way of comparing the present image and the past sensation?
These considerations, however, are taking us away from psychology, to which we must now return.
I shall discuss this question in later lectures.
In this way the whole status of images as "copies" is bound up with the analysis of memory.
If we are to know as it is supposed we do-that images are "copies," accurate or inaccurate, of past events, something more than the mere occurrence of images must go to constitute this knowledge.
Most people and animals find it essential to their happiness to spend a good deal of their time in familiar surroundings, which are especially comforting when any danger threatens.
But I do not think such an inference is warranted.
The recollection of a unique event cannot, so Bergson contends, be wholly constituted by habit, and is in fact something radically different from the memory which is habit.
There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a population that "remembered" a wholly unreal past.
The definition of "my experience" is difficult; broadly speaking, it is everything that is connected with what I am experiencing now by certain links, of which the various forms of memory are among the most important.
"Habit" is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times; if the behaviourist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit, that can only be because he trusts his memory, when it assures him that there have been other times.
We often feel that something in our sensible environment is familiar, without having any definite recollection of previous occasions on which we have seen it.
The recollection alone is true memory.
The question which of these occurs is not of any importance for the theoretic serviceability of the characteristic in question.
To deal with this problem, we must have a theory of memory.
But apart from this, there are other marks.
And what sort of evidence is logically possible?
Some points may be taken as fixed, and such as any theory of memory must arrive at.
Such modifications of Hume's principle, however, do not affect the problem which I wish to present for your consideration, namely: Why do we believe that images are, sometimes or always, approximately or exactly, copies of sensations?
The second datum is that we certainly have more capacity for knowing the past than for knowing the future.
Very often our knowledge of the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present is inferred from its temporal relations to other remembered events.
How is it possible to know that a memory image is an imperfect copy, without having a more accurate copy by which to replace it?
The difficulty of this question arises through the fact that the sensation which an image is supposed to copy is in the past when the image exists, and can therefore only be known by memory, while, on the other hand, memory of past sensations seems only possible by means of present images.
This would SEEM to suggest that we have a way of knowing the past which is independent of images, by means of which we can criticize image memories.
Recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more than a habit of association: the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word "cat," or with an auditory image of purring, or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment.
I am not sure that there is anything substantial in this point.
We may even have used words to describe it to ourselves while it was happening; in that case, the habit of these words may fulfil the function of Bergson's true memory, while in reality it is nothing but habit memory.
I do not wish to undertake the analysis of belief at present, since it will be the subject of the twelfth lecture; for the present I merely wish to emphasize the fact that recognition, in our second sense, consists in a belief, which we may express approximately in the words: "This has existed before."
It does not involve a definite memory of a definite past event, but only the knowledge that something happening now is similar to something that happened before.
What sort of evidence is there?
Nevertheless, whatever a sceptic might urge in theory, we cannot practically doubt that we got up this morning, that we did various things yesterday, that a great war has been taking place, and so on.
I can set to work now to remember things I never remembered before, such as what I had to eat for breakfast this morning, and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this.
Here we have a definite influence of past experience, but not necessarily any actual knowledge of the past.
He gives the instance of learning a lesson by heart: when I know it by heart I am said to "remember" it, but this merely means that I have acquired certain habits; on the other hand, my recollection of (say) the second time I read the lesson while I was learning it is the recollection of a unique event, which occurred only once.
In like manner, in the study of memory, the certainties with which you begin are very vague, and the more precise propositions at which you try to arrive are less certain than the hazy data from which you set out.
Our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must, in fundamental cases, be based upon a characteristic of the image itself, since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image.
Nay, I rather thrilled, Distrusting every light that seemed to gild The onward path, and feared to overlean A finger even.

The second passed in height The first, and sought the forehead, and half missed, Half falling on the hair.
I miss the clear Fond voices which, being drawn and reconciled Into the music of Heaven's undefiled, Call me no longer.
Oh, to shoot My soul's full meaning into future years, That they should lend it utterance, and salute Love that endures, from life that disappears!
Then I, long tried By natural ills, received the comfort fast, While budding, at thy sight, my pilgrim's staff Gave out green leaves with morning dews impearled. I seek no copy now of life's first half: Leave here the pages with long musing curled, And write me new my future's epigraph, New angel mine, unhoped for in the world!
Shall I never miss Home talk and blessing and the common kiss That comes to each in turn, nor count it strange, When I look up, to drop on a new range Of walls and floors, another home than this? Nay, wilt thou fill that place by me which is Filled by dead eyes too tender to know change That's hardest.

A ring of amethyst I could not wear here, plainer to my sight, Than that first kiss.

And says; Thou mother of my children, I have loved thee And I have given thee a crown that none can take away.

She wandered in the land of clouds thro' valleys dark, listning Dolors and lamentations: waiting oft beside the dewy grave She stood in silence, listning to the voices of the ground, Till to her own grave plot she came, and there she sat down. And heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow pit.
Why a Tongue impress'd with honey from every wind? Why an Ear, a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in? Why a Nostril wide inhaling terror trembling and affright Why a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy? Why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire?

[YOU THOUGHT I HAD FORGOTTEN]
VENICE
In a sunset glowing of crimson and gold, She lies, the glory of the world, A beached king's galley, whose sails are furled, Who is hung with tapestries rich and old.
He had got into her courtyard. She was alone that night. Through the black night rain, he sang to her window bars:
Suddenly I was back in the old days Before you felt we ought to drift apart. It was some trick-the way your eyebrows raise,
TO WAR
Your hands-some vivid trifle.
CALM DAY, WITH ROLLERS
Always the ships that move in mystery, on the dim horizon, Shadow filled sails of dreams, sliding over the blue grey ocean, Far from the rock edged shore where willow green waves are rushing, And white foam people leap, to stand erect for the moment.
And still the sensitive silhouettes Of the gondolas pass and leave no track, Light on the tides as lilies, and black In the rippling waters of long sunsets.
With a start Then I remembered how I lived alone, Writing bad poems and eating out my heart
Desperately immortal, she; She stands With wide hands Dim through the veil of eternity, Behind the supreme door.
A little pagan child god plays Beyond the far horizon haze, And underneath the twilight trees He blows a bubble to the breeze, Which is borne upward in the night And makes the heavens shine with light. But soon it sinks to earth again, And, hitting hills, it bursts!
The other day at someone's tea we met, Smiling gayly, bowed, and went our several ways, Complacent with successful coldness.--Yet
"A good old tune," she murmured --and I found we were dancing.
Guided by you, how we might stroll towards death, Our only music one another's breath, Through gardens intimate with hollyhocks, Where silent poppies burn between the rocks, By pools where birches bend to confidants Above green waters scummed with lily plants.
And then With foam the skies are splashed and sprayed; And that's how all the stars are made.
--That was but rustling of dripping plants in the dark. More tightly under his cloak, he clasped his guitar.
And when the fireflies mix their circling glow Through the dark plants, then gently might I know Your lips, light as the wings of the dragon flies....
You are the star that made the skies all bright, Yet tore itself away in flaming flight; You are the tree that suddenly awoke; You are the rose that came to life and spoke....
Well, I had! (Although I never guessed I could forget Those few great moments when we both went mad.)
There we might wander, you and I alone, Through gardens filled with marble seats moss grown, And fountains-water threads that winds disperse- While in the spray the birds sit and converse.
She was alone that night. He had broken into her courtyard. Above the gurgling gutters he heard- surely- a door unchained?
THRENODY
You thought I had forgotten.
The music beats, up the chasmed street, Then flares from around the curve; The cheers break out from the waving crowd: --Our soldiers march, superb! Over the track lined city street The young men, the grinning men, pass.
And ah! that moon of silver sheen! It is my heart hung in the sky; And no clouds ever float between The grave flowers and my heart on high.
PHONOGRAPH-TANGO
Thus walk I through my wonderland While all the evening is atune, Beneath the cypress trees that stand Like candles to the barren moon.
She is lain with high things and with low. She lies With shut eyes, Rocked in the eternal flow Of silence evermore.
I do not read upon each stone The name that once was carven there; I merely note new blossoms blown And breathe the perfume of the air.
Another band beats down the street; Contending rhythms clash; New melodies win place, then fade, And the flashing legs move past. Down the cheering, grey paved street The fringed flags, the erect flags, pass.
The pleasant graveyard of my soul With sentimental cypress trees And flowers is filled, that I may stroll In meditation, at my ease.
"'Scuse me," said Trot; "I neglected to tell you that you're not the Boolooroo any more.
When the courtiers and the people assembled saw the goat they gave a great cheer, for the beast had helped to dethrone their wicked Ruler.
"Guess I'd better send for him an' tell him what's happened."
All the rubbish was piled in the square before the palace and a bonfire made of it, while the Blue people clustered around and danced and sang with joy as the blue flames devoured the dreadful instrument that had once caused them so much unhappiness.
Then the Room of the Great Knife was cleared of its awful furniture.
All of Sky Island, except the Fog Bank, is now my kingdom, so I welcome my faithful Pinkies to my Blue City, where you are to be royally entertained and have a good time.
When he finished she said cheerfully:
He was looking downcast and sad, and it was easy to see he was disappointed because he had not conquered the Boolooroo himself.
"I escaped from the City because the Boolooroo tried to patch me, as you all know, and the Six Snubnosed Princesses tried to marry me, which would have been a far greater misfortune.
"You won't be hurt," answered the girl, "but you'll have to find some other place to stay besides this palace, an' perhaps you'll enjoy workin' for a livin, by way of variety."
This was done, the once royal family departing from the palace with shamed and downcast looks.
I'm the Boolooroo!"
"No," said Trot, positively, "there's been enough patching in this country and I won't have any more of it.
The combined bands of both the countries played the music and a fine supper was served.
"Not even a bird cage," said she.
"You are, mate," replied the sailor.
"Don't worry, Sizzle dear; it'll all come right pretty soon.
"Hooray!" yelled the parrot,
After they had eaten all they could, and the servants had been sent away, Trot related her adventures, telling how, with the assistance of the billygoat, she had turned the tables on the wicked Boolooroo.
"Won't you please get rid of them, too, your Majesty?
"I think it will be best for us to go back to our own country as soon as possible," suggested Rosalie the Witch; "for, if we stay here very long, the Blueskins may rise against us and cause the Pinkies much trouble."
In this order they proceeded to the main gate, which Trot ordered the guards to throw wide open.
But before I do that I want the privilege of patching the Snubnosed Princesses to each other-mixing the six as much as possible-and then I want to patch the former Boolooroo to the billygoat, which is the same punishment he was going to inflict upon Cap'n Bill."
Can't they be discharged?"
However, as the two forces came nearer together, Button Bright spied Trot and Cap'n Bill standing before the enemy, and the sight astonished him considerably.
"I'll gladly do that," promised the new Boolooroo; "and I'll feed the honorable goat all the shavings and leather and tin cans he can eat, besides the grass.
The guards had a terrible struggle with the goat, which was loose in the room and still wanted to fight, but finally they subdued the animal and then they took the Boolooroo out of the frame he was tied in and brought both him and the goat before Queen Trot, who awaited them in the throne room of the palace.
"Stop it!" said Button Bright; "I can't hear myself think."
"Here's a pretty howdy do- You haven't any Boolooroo!"
Then she gave Rosalie back her magic ring, thanking the kind Witch for all she had done for them.
The former Boolooroo groaned.
It isn't a very pretty cabin and the furniture is cheap and common, but I'm sure it is good enough for this wicked man and his family."
The soldiers wore their best blue uniforms and were formed before the palace in marching order, so Trot and Cap'n Bill headed the procession, and then came the soldiers-all keeping step-and then the bands, playing very loud noises on their instruments, and finally the crowd of Blue citizens waving flags and banners and shouting joyfully.
I'll always be Queen of Sky Island, but the Pink and Blue Countries must each have a Ruler.
I'm nearly starved, myself, for this conquerin' kingdoms is hard work."
"I have said no, an' I mean it," answered the girl.
Then they all marched out a little way into the fields and found that the Army of Pinkies had already formed and was advancing steadily toward them.
As they led the now famous animal from the room the Boolooroo shuddered and said:
and then he flapped his wings and barked like a dog with pure delight, and added as fast as his bird's tongue could speak:
"Am I to be patched, or what?"
"You let the poor old Boolooroo alone.
But the people called upon him for a speech, so he faced the Blueskins and said:
Trot had listened carefully to the Majordomo's speech.
When first they entered the throne room they tried to be as haughty and scornful as ever, but the Blues who were assembled there all laughed at them and jeered them, for there was not a single person in all the Blue Country who loved the Princesses the least little bit.
It will be such a satisfaction."
"You're right, Cap'n," she returned.
"How dare you people give orders in my palace?
So the Captain of the Guards was given the key and told to fetch the Boolooroo from the Room of the Great Knife.
He'll look after this end of the Island hereafter, an' unless I'm much mistaken he'll do it a heap better than you did."
"I'll have 'Sizzle make a fine yard for the goat, where he'll have plenty of blue grass to eat.
"Pinkies," said she, "your Queen has conquered the Boolooroo and is now the Queen of the Blues.
"It's my idee as he's braver than the whole Blue Army put together."
"Can't I take any of the treasure with me?" he pleaded.
The soldiers again rolled the frame in position, having first pulled the Great Knife once more to the top of the derrick.
"You'll take it easy, 'cause you can't help yourself," said Cap'n Bill. "What next, Queen Trot?"
As soon as the soldiers return with Tiggle," said he.
At once the goat gave a leap, escaped from the soldiers and with bowed head rushed upon the Boolooroo.
"Suppose it's a friend?" he suggested.
When all was in readiness the King pulled the cord a second time and Trot at the same instant pulled upon her rope.
Trot was horrified, and wrung her little hands in sore perplexity, for this was a most horrible fate that awaited her dear old friend.
The Room of the Great Knife was high and big, and around it ran rows of benches for the spectators to sit upon.
So Cap'n Bill held the Boolooroo, and the girl tied him fast in position, as Cap'n Bill had been tied, so that his Majesty couldn't wiggle at all.
They marched to their chairs and seated themselves to enjoy the cruel scene their father was about to enact, and Cap'n Bill bowed to them politely and said:
"I wouldn't mind a cup o' coffee myself," said Cap'n Bill.
The Captain shook his head.
"Everyone hates me, and I don't object to that because I hate everybody.
"What's become of Tiggle?" he shouted.
"Splendid!
"Villains!" he shouted, "go out and arrest the first living thing you meet, and whoever it proves to be will be instantly patched to Cap'n Bill."
"Don't mind him, Cap'n," said Trot, "but fetch him along to the frame."
The poor Queen, by the way, was seldom seen, as she passed all her time playing solitaire with a deck that was one card short, hoping that before she had lived her entire six hundred years she would win the game.
Some of the soldiers laughed, too, being tickled with the absurd notion, and the Six Snubnosed Princesses all sat up straight and permitted themselves to smile contemptuously.
Suddenly there was a noise in the corridor and evidence of scuffling and struggling.
The idea of patching Cap'n Bill to a goat was vastly amusing to him, and the more he thought of it the more he roared with laughter.
As soon as they entered the Room of the Great Knife the Boolooroo gave a yell of disappointment.
"Hold him steady in the frame and I'll tie him up," she replied.
And, in order that the slicing would be accurate, there was another frame, to which the prisoner was tied so that he couldn't wiggle either way.
"Where's Tiggle?
"Papa," exclaimed Turquoise, angrily, "can you not prevent this vile Earth Being from addressing us?
But while this was going on Trot had crept up and fastened one end of her rope to the frame in which Cap'n Bill was confined.
This frame was on rollers, so that it could be placed directly underneath the knife.
"All right, Cap'n," she said in a satisfied tone, "I guess we can run this Blue Country ourselves, after this."
Then they rolled the frame underneath the Great Knife and handed the Boolooroo the cord that released the blade.
Invisible Trot followed soberly after them, still wondering what she could do to save her friend.
Before any could stop him he butted his Majesty so furiously that the King soared far into the air and tumbled in a heap among the benches, where he lay moaning and groaning.
Go at once, you dummies, and find him-or it will go hard with you!"
"Of course not," said the Boolooroo.
He nodded cheerfully, then, and said:
When this had been accomplished the Boolooroo leaned over to try to discover why the frame rolled away-seemingly of its own accord-and he was the more puzzled because it had never done such a thing before.
In one place-at the head of the room-was a raised platform for the royal family, with elegant throne chairs for the King and Queen and six smaller but richly upholstered chairs for the Snubnosed Princesses.
"Control yourselves, my dears," replied the Boolooroo; "the worst punishment I know how to inflict on anyone, this prisoner is about to suffer.
"So ho!" roared the monarch, "you thought you could defy me, Earth Clod, did you?
He jumped down from the platform and commanded the soldiers to raise the Great Knife into position.
My guards are not to be trusted, and I don't mean to let you out of my sight again until you are patched."
"As how?" he asked, stepping from the frame.
"We will proceed with the Ceremony of Patching at once."
"I'll have revenge!--I'll-I'll-"
Then they rolled the frame in position underneath the Great Knife and Trot held in her hand the cord which would release it.
After breakfast was over a procession was formed, headed by the Boolooroo, and they marched the prisoner through the palace until they came to the Room of the Great Knife.
"Hi, there!" he cried; "where are my soldiers?
So the Captain took a file of soldiers and went away very sorrowful, for he did not know who would be the victim, and if the Boolooroo had no friends, the Captain had plenty, and did not wish to see them patched.
But you were mistaken.
While Trot was observing this dreadful machine the door opened and in walked the Six Snubnosed Princesses, all in a row and with their chins up, as if they disdained everyone but themselves.
"First, bind the Earth Man in the frame," commanded the Boolooroo. "We'll slice him in two before we do the same to the billygoat."
"Why, you said to fetch the first living creature we met, and that was this billygoat," replied the Captain, panting hard as he held fast to one of the goat's horns.
Fine!
But I'm the Ruler here, and I'll do as I please.
What do you mean, prisoner, by daring to lay hands upon me?
This would indeed be a severe punishment; therefore the Princesses were pleased at the thought of Cap'n Bill's becoming half a billygoat, and the billygoat's being half Cap'n Bill.
No one can resist the Mighty Boolooroo of the Blues, so it is folly for you to rebel against my commands.
Trot was in the room, too, standing in a corner and listening to all that was said while she racked her little brain for an idea that would enable her to save Cap'n Bill from being patched.
Go and capture the first living creature you see, and bring him here to be patched to Cap'n Bill."
Rich jewels of blue stones glittered upon their persons and the royal ladies were fully as gorgeous as they were haughty and overbearing.
Finding himself free, he turned and assaulted the soldiers, butting them so fiercely that they tumbled down in bunches and as soon as they could rise again ran frantically from the room and along the corridors as if a fiend was after them.
But Cap'n Bill made no such attempt, knowing it would be useless.
The frightened soldiers hurried away to find Tiggle, and Trot was well pleased because she knew Tiggle was by this time safely hidden.
Then the door flew open and in came the soldiers dragging a great blue billygoat, which was desperately striving to get free.
The immense blade was so heavy that it took the strength of seven Blueskins to raise it.
These plumes waved gracefully in the air with every mincing step the Princesses took.
"Stop it!
Glorious!" cried the Boolooroo, wiping the tears of merriment from his eyes.
Cap'n Bill rolled away in his frame and the knife fell harmlessly.
"When?
Hold him fast, my men, and as soon as I've had my coffee and oatmeal I'll take him to the Room of the Great Knife and patch him."
Then she seated herself in an out of the way place and quietly waited.
"Huh!" exclaimed the Boolooroo; "that's queer.
THE AMAZING CONQUEST OF THE BLUES
No one could see her, so no one-not even Cap'n Bill-knew she was there.
As he stood, bent nearly double, his back was toward the billygoat, which, in their interest and excitement, the soldiers were holding in a careless manner.
Now, indeed, the Boolooroo was as angry as he was amazed.
Roll him up again, soldiers."
The Boolooroo stared a moment and then he fell back in his throne, laughing boisterously.
The Captain of the Guards hesitated to obey this order.
"Very well," replied the Boolooroo, "you shall eat with me, for then I can keep an eye on you.
But it were a pretty close call an' I hope it won't happen again.
The same thing happened as before.
It is an insult to be spoken to by one about to be patched."
The knife was built into a huge framework, like a derrick, that reached to the ceiling, and it was so arranged that when the Boolooroo pulled a cord the great blade would drop down in its frame and neatly cut in two the person who stood under it.
The Boolooroo stamped up and down the room, muttering threats and declaring Cap'n Bill should be patched whether Tiggle was found or not, and while they waited Trot took time to make an inspection of the place, which she now saw for the first time in broad daylight.
"I can't think of anyone just now, your Spry and Flighty High and Mighty Majesty," he answered.
Immediately the Boolooroo flew into another towering rage.
Meantime Trot, being invisible to all, was roaming around the room and behind a bench she found a small coil of rope, which she picked up.
Therefore her Majesty paid no attention to anyone and no one paid any attention to her.
The sailor followed and pulled out the Boolooroo, who, when he saw the terrible goat was captured and tied fast, quickly recovered his courage.
While he put on his clothes the king occasionally gave the cord a sudden pull, hoping to hurt Cap'n Bill's big toe and make him yell; but as no response came to this mean action the Boolooroo finally looked into the room, only to find he had been pulling on a leg of the couch and that his prisoner had escaped.
Then she stood back and watched the Boolooroo, and just as he pulled the cord she pulled on her rope and dragged the frame on its rollers away, so that the Great Knife fell with a crash and sliced nothing but the air.
Now let us to business."
"Now let the devils strike our scent!" said the scout, tearing two rifles, with all their attendant accouterments, from beneath a bush, and flourishing "killdeer" as he handed Uncas his weapon; "two, at least, will find it to their deaths."
But I thought I would make the offer, seeing that youth commonly loves life.
So, Uncas, you had better take the lead, while I will put on the skin again, and trust to cunning for want of speed."
'twas nothing but wonderment."
But it was not the policy of Hawkeye to affect the least concealment.
CHAPTER twenty six
The scout hesitated, and appeared to muse.
"Whither?"
"Can you lead me to him?"
"Hawkeye!"
"Hold!" said the scout, grasping his friend by the shoulder, "let them yell again!
"Uncas will stay," was the calm reply.
"Cut his bands," said Hawkeye to David, who just then approached them.
But the bear, instead of obeying, maintained the seat it had taken, and growled:
Hold your head down, and draw in your legs; their formation might tell the truth too early.
"For what?"
If you stay, it must be to sit down here in the shadow, and take the part of Uncas, until such times as the cunning of the Indians discover the cheat, when, as I have already said, your times of trial will come.
So choose for yourself-to make a rush or tarry here."
Still they betrayed no intention to depart.
Then, as if satisfied of their safety, the scout left his position, and slowly entered the place. It was silent and gloomy, being tenanted solely by the captive, and lighted by the dying embers of a fire, which had been used for the purposed of cookery.
The little knot of Indians drew back in a body, and suffered, as they thought, the conjurer and his inspired assistant to proceed.
The scout, who had left David at the door, to ascertain they were not observed, thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy.
That Providence is partial in its gifts, for its own wise reasons, the best and most contented of us must allow."
It was easy to follow the tracks of the Narragansetts, but they seemed only to have wandered without guides, or any other object than the pursuit of food.
Having reached within a few yards of the latter, he arose to his feet, silently and slowly.
The impressions of footsteps were numerous, but they all appeared like those of men who had wandered about the spot, without any design to quit it.
Still no discovery was made. At length Uncas, whose activity had enabled him to achieve his portion of the task the soonest, raked the earth across the turbid little rill which ran from the spring, and diverted its course into another channel. So soon as its narrow bed below the dam was dry, he stooped over it with keen and curious eyes.
It was impossible to discover the expression of his features through the grotesque mask of paint under which they were concealed, though Duncan fancied it was rather melancholy than savage. His head was shaved, as usual, with the exception of the crown, from whose tuft three or four faded feathers from a hawk's wing were loosely dangling.
During one of these conferences Heyward observed that Uncas stood a patient and silent, though, as he imagined, an interested listener.
"He appears to have no arms; nor does he seem to be viciously inclined. Unless he communicate the alarm to his fellows, who, as you see, are dodging about the water, we have but little to fear from him."
It was fortunate they did so.
"Of that there is little cause of fear," returned the scout, slowly shaking his head; "this is a firm and straight, though a light step, and not over long.
Fire on no account."
This is my schooling, major; and if one neglects the book, there is little chance of learning from the open land of Providence.
Repeating the words, "Fellows who are dodging about the water!" he added, "so much for schooling and passing a boyhood in the settlements! The knave has long legs, though, and shall not be trusted.
Here we have three pair of moccasins, and two of little feet.
Recovering his recollection on the instant, instead of sounding an alarm, which might prove fatal to himself, he remained stationary, an attentive observer of the other's motions.
"See!" said Uncas, pointing north and south, at the evident marks of the broad trail on either side of him, "the dark hair has gone toward the forest."
"Such cunning is not without its deviltry," exclaimed Hawkeye, when he met the disappointed looks of his assistants.
After proceeding a few miles, the progress of Hawkeye, who led the advance, became more deliberate and watchful.
If anything should happen, the call will be three croaks of a crow.
The whole party now proceeded, following the course of the rill, keeping anxious eyes on the regular impressions.
"If I see you in danger, may I not risk a shot?"
The eyes of the whole party followed the unexpected movement, and read their success in the air of triumph that the youth assumed.
From such undeniable testimony did the practised woodsman arrive at the truth, with nearly as much certainty and precision as if he had been a witness of all those events which his ingenuity so easily elucidated. Cheered by these assurances, and satisfied by a reasoning that was so obvious, while it was so simple, the party resumed its course, after making a short halt, to take a hurried repast.
Yet that is not the footstep of an Indian! the weight is too much on the heel, and the toes are squared, as though one of the French dancers had been in, pigeon winging his tribe!
A circle of a few hundred feet in circumference was drawn, and each of the party took a segment for his portion.
The dews were suffered to exhale, and the sun had dispersed the mists, and was shedding a strong and clear light in the forest, when the travelers resumed their journey.
You will find a beautiful print of it just opposite yon rock, agin the hillside."
It is true that the horses are here, but the Hurons are gone; let us, then, hunt for the path by which they parted."
I saw one of the birds fanning himself in the air, just beyond the dead oak-another sign that we are approaching an encampment."
Then he reappeared, creeping along the earth, from which his dress was hardly distinguishable, directly in the rear of his intended captive.
A ragged calico mantle half encircled his body, while his nether garment was composed of an ordinary shirt, the sleeves of which were made to perform the office that is usually executed by a much more commodious arrangement.
At last the scout spoke in English, and at once explained the embarrassment of their situation.
But while the earth was trodden, and the footsteps of both men and beasts were so plainly visible around the place, the trail appeared to have suddenly ended.
By the Lord, it is no longer than a child's and yet the maidens are tall and comely.
An instant of calm observation served to assure Duncan that he was undiscovered.
Hawkeye and the Mohicans now applied themselves to their task in good earnest.
Run back, Uncas, and bring me the size of the singer's foot.
"How now, friend! have you a mind to teach the beavers to sing?"
"You see we have reached their settlement or encampment," whispered the young man; "and here is one of the savages himself, in a very embarrassing position for our further movements."
Instead of taking the alarm, the unconscious savage stretched forward his neck, as if he also watched the movements about the gloomy lake, with a sort of silly curiosity.
Then lowering the dangerous muzzle he stretched forward his long neck, as if to assist a scrutiny that was already intensely keen.
"If you find a man there, he shall die a flea's death." --Merry Wives of Windsor.
Do you keep him under your rifle while I creep in behind, through the bush, and take him alive.
The scout turned to Heyward, and regarded him a moment with unconcealed amazement.
He soon stopped again, and waited for the whole party to come up.
The spirits of the scout, and the astonishing success of the chase, in which a circuitous distance of more than forty miles had been passed, did not fail to impart a portion of hope to the whole party.
Can you see where he has put his rifle or his bow?"
"Fire a whole platoon, major."
"Hound never ran on a more beautiful scent," responded the scout, dashing forward, at once, on the indicated route; "we are favored, greatly favored, and can follow with high noses.
"But," cried Duncan, "I see no signs of-"
"The gentle ones," interrupted the scout; "the varlet has found a way to carry them, until he supposed he had thrown any followers off the scent. My life on it, we see their pretty little feet again, before many rods go by."
No, no; my knowledge for it, neither of them was nigh fainting, hereaway.
He often stopped to examine the trees; nor did he cross a rivulet without attentively considering the quantity, the velocity, and the color of its waters. Distrusting his own judgment, his appeals to the opinion of Chingachgook were frequent and earnest.
See, the heel has hardly touched the ground; and there the dark hair has made a little jump, from root to root.
No, no; I have heard that the French Indians had come into these hills to hunt the moose, and we are getting within scent of their camp. Why should they not?
Hawkeye started, and dropped his rifle, when, directed by the finger of his companion, the stranger came under his view.
In the meantime, the uplifted hand of Hawkeye was above him.
"Softly, softly, we know our path; but it is good to examine the formation of things.
The fellow is stricken with a judgment, and is mad!
Human natur' is weak, and it is possible we may not have taken the proper scent."
"I scent the Hurons," he said, speaking to the Mohicans; "yonder is open sky, through the treetops, and we are getting too nigh their encampment. Sagamore, you will take the hillside, to the right; Uncas will bend along the brook to the left, while I will try the trail.
In the next moment he was concealed by the leaves.
The young Mohican cast a glance at his father, but, maintaining his quiet and reserved mien, he continued silent.
"Shall we proceed?" demanded Heyward.
Pass me the thong of buckskin, Uncas, and let me take the length of this foot.
"'tis the trail!" exclaimed the scout, advancing to the spot; "the lad is quick of sight and keen of wit for his years."
Altogether, the appearance of the individual was forlorn and miserable.
Before an hour had elapsed, however, the speed of Hawkeye sensibly abated, and his head, instead of maintaining its former direct and forward look, began to turn suspiciously from side to side, as if he were conscious of approaching danger.
Pursuing the direction given by this discovery, he entered the neighboring thicket, and struck the trail, as fresh and obvious as it had been before they reached the spring.
The water soon flowed into its bed again, but watching the ground on either side, the foresters pursued their way content with knowing that the trail lay beneath.
CHAPTER twenty one
Has Uncas no counsel to offer in such a strait?"
Chingachgook had caught the look, and motioning with his hand, he bade him speak.
Not a leaf was left unturned.
The sticks were removed, and the stones lifted; for Indian cunning was known frequently to adopt these objects as covers, laboring with the utmost patience and industry, to conceal each footstep as they proceeded.
The consultation had the twofold merit of definiteness and brevity.
German and English translations are available, but the most acceptable English version, besides laboring under the handicaps of an archaic style, had to be condensed into half its volume in order to accomplish the "streamlining" of the book.
At the end of his lectures in fifteen thirty one, Luther uttered a brief prayer and then dictated two Scriptural texts, which we shall inscribe at the end of these introductory remarks:
It is my Katherine." Much later when a friend of his was preparing an edition of all his Latin works, he remarked to his home circle: "If I had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine.
In his table talks the saying is recorded: "The Epistle to the galatians is my epistle.
"I will, on one condition."
The work had to be condensed.
THEODORE GRAEBNER
The preparation of this edition of Luther's Commentary on galatians was first suggested to me by mr p j Zondervan, of the firm of publishers, in March, nineteen thirty seven.
"The Lord who has given us power to teach and to hear, let Him also give us the power to serve and to do."
"Luther is still the greatest name in Protestantism.
Luther's commentary fills seven hundred and thirty three octavo pages in the Weidman Edition of his works.
My galatians, for instance."
The Reformer had lectured on this Epistle of saint Paul's in fifteen nineteen and again in fifteen twenty three.
It presents like no other of Luther's writings the central thought of Christianity, the justification of the sinner for the sake of Christ's merits alone.
It was written in Latin.
Let us begin with that: his Commentary on galatians..."
We want you to help us publish some leading work of Luther's for the general American market.
"And what book would be your choice?"
Translated by Theodore Graebner
Roerer took down Luther's lectures and this manuscript has been preserved to the present day, in a copy which contains also additions by Veit Dietrich and by Cruciger, friends of Roerer's, who with him attended Luther's lectures.
We were resolved not to present this entire mass of exegesis.
This is a LibriVox recording.
The demonstration seemed to prove convincing for it was agreed that one may as well offer Luther in the original German or Latin as expect the American church member to read any translations that would adhere to Luther's German or Latin constructions and employ the Mid Victorian type of English characteristic of the translations now on the market.
But the essence of Luther's lectures is there.
In other words, these three men took down the lectures which Luther addressed to his students in the course of galatians, and Roerer prepared the manuscript for the printer.
"And what is that?"
All LibriVox recordings are in the public domain.
It would have run to more than fifteen hundred pages, ordinary octavo (like this), since it is impossible to use the compressed structure of sentences which is characteristic of Latin, and particularly of Luther's Latin.
The Word of our God shall stand forever.
By Martin Luther
The lectures which are preserved in the works herewith submitted to the American public were delivered in fifteen thirty one.
PREFACE
"The condition is that I will be permitted to make Luther talk American, 'streamline' him, so to speak-because you will never get people, whether in or outside the Lutheran Church, actually to read Luther unless we make him talk as he would talk today to Americans."
Will you do it?"
It was his favorite among all the Biblical books.
Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace, Good will to men.
To it I am as it were in wedlock.
My call is the highest possible, for it is by Jesus Christ, and God the Father."
VERSE one.
Against these boasting, false apostles, Paul boldly defends his apostolic authority and ministry.
Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead).
Paul takes pride in his ministry, not to his own praise but to the praise of God.
Paul loses no time in defending himself against the charge that he had thrust himself into the ministry.
The Certainty of Our Calling
He reminds them of the time when he opposed peter to his face and reproved the chief of the apostles.
In fact I am an apostle."
Paul came later and is beneath us.
They said to the galatians: "You have no right to think highly of Paul.
If he says, "Thou shalt be damned," you tell him: "No, for I fly to Christ who gave Himself for my sins.
"Do you suppose that God for the sake of a few Lutheran heretics would disown His entire Church?
This sort of thing brings the Gospel into trouble.
VERSE six.
He puts on white to make himself look like an angel of light.
VERSE one.
It indicates his sorrow and his displeasure.
He says to the galatians: "My call may seem inferior to you.
We heard Him preach.
Every minister should make much of his calling and impress upon others the fact that he has been delegated by God to preach the Gospel.
The most they could claim is that they were sent by others.
He was the last to turn to Christ.
Paul stands alone.
Unable to prevail by force, he engages wicked and ungodly teachers who at first make common cause with us, then claim that they are particularly called to teach the hidden mysteries of the Scriptures to superimpose upon the first principles of Christian doctrine that we teach.
Or do you suppose that God would have left His Church floundering in error all these centuries?" The galatians were taken in by such arguments with the result that Paul's authority and doctrine were drawn in question.
Today the Anabaptists and others, finding it difficult to condemn us, accuse us Lutherans of timidity in professing the whole truth.
As a result we have this paradoxical situation: The Gospel supplies the world with the salvation of Jesus Christ, peace of conscience, and every blessing.
Paul devotes the first two chapters to a defense of his office and his Gospel, affirming that he received it, not from men, but from the Lord Jesus Christ by special revelation, and that if he or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel than the one he had preached, he shall be accursed.
The devil knows better than to appear ugly and black.
As the ambassador of a government is honored for his office and not for his private person, so the minister of Christ should exalt his office in order to gain authority among men.
These Jewish Christian fanatics who pushed themselves into the Galatian churches after Paul's departure, boasted that they were the descendants of Abraham, true ministers of Christ, having been trained by the apostles themselves, that they were able to perform miracles.
Paul, an apostle, (not of men, etc)
Paul exalts his ministry out of the desire to make known the name, the grace, and the mercy of God.
From him that called you into the grace of Christ.
He has not seen Christ, nor has he had much contact with the other apostles. Indeed, he persecuted the Church of Christ for a long time."
VERSE six.
saint Paul wrote this epistle because, after his departure from the Galatian churches, Jewish Christian fanatics moved in, who perverted Paul's Gospel of man's free justification by faith in Christ Jesus.
When men claiming such credentials come along, they deceive not only the naive, but also those who seemingly are well established in the faith. This same argument is used by the papacy.
Unto another gospel.
There may be something to that.
Just for that the world abhors the Gospel.
I am angry with you." But his purpose was to call them back to the Gospel.
Humble man that he was, he will not now take a back seat.
It must be watched.
After rounding the peak, she steered direct for the channel to which Servadac by his gestures was pointing her, and was not long in entering the creek.
The count shook his head.
Captain Servadac hastened towards him.
"I am quite aware of it.
Was he aware, in short, that the entire motions of the terrestrial sphere had undergone a complete modification? To all these inquiries, the count responded in the affirmative.
"I am not sure," said he, "but what the tour of the Mediterranean will prove to be the tour of the world."
CHAPTER nine.
The lieutenant shook his head.
CHAPTER ten A SEARCH FOR ALGERIA
Count Timascheff was himself no sailor, but had the greatest confidence in leaving the command of his yacht in the hands of Lieutenant Procope, a man of about thirty years of age, and an excellent seaman.
The lieutenant paused to allow time for reflection, and added: "Moreover, I have every reason to believe that we are not so near the sun as we have been.
Nothing was to be done but to put about, and return in disappointment towards the north.
But Algiers, like all the other coast towns, had apparently been absorbed into the bowels of the earth.
I confess I am puzzled."
"There is no fear of that, sir.
Captain Servadac, with clenched teeth and knitted brow, stood sternly, almost fiercely, regarding the boundless waste of water.
"No doubt about that," said Servadac; "and I suppose that, having crossed the orbit of Venus, we have a good chance of running into the orbit of Mercury."
After pondering awhile, he said: "If we were farther away I should expect to find a depth of two or three hundred fathoms instead of five fathoms.
The lieutenant was well informed in many matters outside the pale of his profession, and his attainments were alike creditable to himself and to the liberal friend who had given him his education.
Perhaps the depths might disclose what the surface failed to reveal, and Count Timascheff, anxious that Servadac should have every facility afforded him for solving his doubts, called for the sounding line.
On the first morning of the cruise Lieutenant Procope, who, like most Russians, spoke French fluently, was explaining these peculiarities to Captain Servadac; the count was present, and the conversation perpetually recurred, as naturally it would, to the phenomena which remained so inexplicable to them all.
I can give you a proof which I think you will own is conclusive.
The late astounding events, however, had rendered Procope manifestly uneasy, and not the less so from his consciousness that the count secretly partook of his own anxiety.
With a favorable wind she would certainly have made eleven knots an hour had not the high waves somewhat impeded her progress.
Happily the recent phenomena had no effect upon the compass; the magnetic needle, which in these regions had pointed about twenty two degrees from the north pole, had never deviated in the least-a proof that, although east and west had apparently changed places, north and south continued to retain their normal position as cardinal points.
The imperial fort, too, was built upon an elevation of seven hundred fifty feet; it is incredible that it should be so totally submerged. Unless some vestiges of these are found, I shall begin to suspect that the whole of Africa has been swallowed in some vast abyss."
Five fathoms!
"And finish up by a collision with the sun!" added the count.
"It is very evident," said the lieutenant, "that ever since the first of January the earth has been moving in a new orbit, and from some unknown cause has drawn nearer to the sun"
All the images of his past life floated upon his memory; his thoughts sped away to his native France, only to return again to wonder whether the depths of ocean would reveal any traces of the Algerian metropolis.
Surely some portion of the Casbah must still rise above the waves?
Would not the loftiest eminences of the city at least be visible?
Nor did these waves in the usual way partially unfurl themselves and rebound against the sides of the vessel; they might rather be described as long undulations carrying the schooner (its weight diminished from the same cause as that of the water) alternately to such heights and depths, that if Captain Servadac had been subject to seasickness he must have found himself in sorry plight.
The ship could not have been in better hands.
"And what demonstration do you offer," asked Servadac eagerly, "that it will not happen?"
Not a material object of any kind was to be noticed floating on the surface of the water; not one branch of a tree had been seen drifting by, nor one spar belonging to one of the numerous vessels that a month previously had been moored in the magnificent bay which stretched twelve miles across from Cape Matafuz to Point Pexade.
"I can, sir.
Her sea going qualities were excellent, and would have amply sufficed for a circumnavigation of the globe.
Although only a moderate breeze was blowing, the sea was rough, a circumstance to be accounted for only by the diminution in the force of the earth's attraction rendering the liquid particles so buoyant, that by the mere effect of oscillation they were carried to a height that was quite unprecedented.
For a few miles she followed the line hitherto presumably occupied by the coast of Algeria; but no land appeared to the south.
"You must see, lieutenant, I should think, that we are not so near the coast of Algeria as you imagined."
Another circumstance was most remarkable.
"Is it not impossible," he murmured aloud, "that any city should disappear so completely?
After an apprenticeship on a merchant ship he had entered the imperial navy, and had already reached the rank of lieutenant when the count appointed him to the charge of his own private yacht, in which he was accustomed to spend by far the greater part of his time, throughout the winter generally cruising in the Mediterranean, whilst in the summer he visited more northern waters.
"Can you satisfy us of that?" asked the count.
Both the count and the captain expressed themselves reassured by his representations, and observed that they must now do all in their power to discover what had become of the vast continent of Africa, of which, they were hitherto failing so completely to find a vestige.
"Simply this, captain: that since the earth entered her new orbit half the sixty four days has already elapsed, and yet it is only just recently that she has crossed the orbit of Venus, hardly one third of the distance to be traversed to reach the sun"
At the same time, we have the problem still unsolved that the Mediterranean has evidently been transported to the equatorial zone."
For the next thirty six hours, until the fourth of February, the sea was examined and explored with the most unflagging perseverance.
His pulse beat fast as he recalled the friends and comrades with whom he had spent the last few years in that vanished city.
Steam up and canvas spread, the schooner started eastwards.
The earth has undoubtedly entered upon a new orbit, but she is not incurring any probable risk of being precipitated onto the sun"
Its depth remained invariable, still four, or at most five, fathoms; and although its bottom was assiduously dredged, it was only to prove it barren of marine production of any type.
Thirsting for glory rather than for gold, slightly scatter brained, but warm hearted, generous, and brave, he was eminently formed to be the protege of the god of battles.
And through a storm of shot, not one of which touched the prostrate officer, the troop passed in safety.
CHAPTER two.
Side by side they fought in two campaigns.
When a private in the eighth Cavalry, he had been on the point of quitting the army at twenty eight years of age, but unexpectedly he had been appointed orderly to Captain Servadac.
She was a colonel's widow, young and handsome, very reserved, not to say haughty in her manner, and either indifferent or impervious to the admiration which she inspired. Captain Servadac had not yet ventured to declare his attachment; of rivals he was well aware he had not a few, and amongst these not the least formidable was the Russian Count Timascheff.
Ben Zoof was devoted, body and soul, to his superior officer.
Ben Zoof, however, did not despair of ultimately converting the captain, and meanwhile had resolved never to leave him.
Hector Servadac was thirty years of age, an orphan without lineage and almost without means.
They came to a place where the side work of the trench had been so riddled by shell that a portion of it had actually fallen in, leaving an aperture quite unsheltered from the grape shot that was pouring in thick and fast.
The bond of union thus effected could never be severed; and although Ben Zoof's achievements had fairly earned him the right of retirement, he firmly declined all honors or any pension that might part him from his superior officer.
The men hesitated.
Servadac had saved Ben Zoof's life in Japan; Ben Zoof had rendered his master a like service in the Soudan.
To crown all, Montmartre boasted a mountain-a veritable mountain; envious tongues indeed might pronounce it little more than a hill; but Ben Zoof would have allowed himself to be hewn in pieces rather than admit that it was anything less than fifteen thousand feet in height.
Ben Zoof's eyes glistened with delight; and from that moment Hector Servadac and Montmartre held equal places in his affection.
In an instant Servadac mounted the side work, laid himself down in the gap, and thus filling up the breach by his own body, shouted, "March on!"
Mother Carey played the dear old common metre tune, and the voices rang out in Whittier's hymn.
The housewarming was at its height, and everybody agreed once in every ten minutes that it was probably the most beautiful party that had ever happened in the history of the world.
Underneath it we lay a posy of pressed daisies, buttercups, and Queen Anne's lace, the wild flowers she loved best."
"We shut our eyes, the flowers bloom on; We murmur, but the corn ears fill; We choose the shadow, but the sun That casts it shines behind us still."
Gilbert, at the head of the procession, held Mother Hamilton's picture, which had been taken from the old brick oven where "my son Tom" had hidden it.
peter crouched on the hearth and lighted the fire in three places, then handed the torch to Kathleen as he crept again into his mother's lap, awed into complete silence by the influence of his own mystic rite. Kathleen waved the torch to and fro as she recited some beautiful lines written for some such purpose as that which called them together to night.
Approaching the dining table, he carefully placed the article in the centre and removed the cloth.
Natty Harmon tried the kitchen pump secretly several times during the evening, for the water had to run up hill all the way from the well to the kitchen sink, and he believed this to be a continual miracle that might "give out" at any moment.
Mother Carey's bedroom, with its bouquets of field flowers on the wall paper, was gaily lighted and ready to receive the gift.
"We cannot be happy without mr Popham."
"Thank you, mr Popham!" said mrs Carey, her eyes twinkling as she looked at the laughing children.
To night there was no need of extra heat, and there were great ceremonies to be observed in lighting the fires on the hearthstones.
Mother Carey poured coffee, Nancy chocolate, and the others helped serve the sandwiches and cake, doughnuts and tarts.
It was as cheery, gay, festive, neighborly, and friendly a supper as ever took place in the dining room of the Yellow House, although Governor Weatherby may have had some handsomer banquets in his time. When it was over all made their way into the rosy, bowery, summer parlor.
THE CAREY HOUSEWARMING
Grant that trust and peace and comfort may abide within, and that love and light and usefulness may go out from this house forever.
He always slipped up his glasses during this performance and closed his eyes, but neither grey hairs nor "specs" could dim the radiant smile that made him seem about fifteen years old and the junior of both his children.
The Careys all sang like thrushes, and even peter, holding his hymn book upside down, put in little bird notes, always on the key, whenever he caught a familiar strain.
The guests naturally had no associations with the Carey Curse, and the Careys themselves were dumb with amazement and despair.
Last of all the entire company gathered round the old-fashioned piano for a parting hymn.
Water flowed freely through Cousin Ann's expensive pipes, that had been buried so deep in their trenches that the winter frosts could not affect them.
"Don't know; 'most everything she says sounds like the Bible or Shakespeare to me."
The tall silver candle sticks gleamed in the firelight, the silver dish of polished Baldwins blushed rosier in the glow.
They began with the one in the family sitting room; Colonel Wheeler, Ralph Thurston, mr and mrs Bill Harmon with Natty and Rufus, mr and mrs Popham with Digby and Lallie Joy, all standing in admiring groups and thrilling with delight at the order of events.
Mother Carey spoke these words so simply and naturally, as she looked towards her neighbors one after another, with her hand resting on Peter's curly head, that they hardly knew whether to keep quiet or say Amen.
It was the Dirty Boy, carefully mended!
The face of the mahogany shone with delight, and why not, when it was doing everything (almost everything!) within the scope of a piano, and yet the family had enjoyed weeks of good nourishing meals on what had been saved by its exertions.
"Once more the liberal year laughs out O'er richer stores than gems or gold; Once more, with harvest song and shout Is Nature's bloodless triumph told."
Thou who settest the solitary in families, bless the life that is sheltered here.
"Was that the Bible, Osh?" whispered Bill Harmon.
Olive had painted the motto on a long narrow panel of canvas, and, giving it to mr Popham, stood by the fireside while he deftly fitted it into the place prepared for it. The family had feared that he would tell a good story when he found himself the centre of attraction, but he was as dumb as peter, and for the same reason.
Next came Olive's turn to help in the ceremonies.
The stove in the cellar, always alluded to by Gilbert as the "young furnace," had not yet been used, save by way of experiment, but it was believed to be a perfect success.
"I've seen this thing layin' in the barn chamber in a thousand pieces all summer!" explained mr Popham radiantly.
Soon another fire sparkled and snapped on the hearth, and there were songs and poems and choruses and Osh Popham's fiddle, to say nothing of the supreme event of the evening, his rendition of "Fly like a youthful hart or roe, over the hills where spices grow," to Mother Carey's accompaniment.
In it are herbs of the field for health of the body, a fern leaf for grace, a sprig of elm for peace, one of oak for strength, with evergreen to show that we live forever in the deeds we have done.
"It was kind of you to spend so much time in our behalf."
Then Nancy handed peter a loosely bound sheaf, saying: "To light this fire I give you a torch.
"Ain't they the greatest?" murmured Lallie Joy, turning to her father, but he had disappeared from the group.
eighteen
There never was anybody needed you so much as she does,--never."
He neglected his wife and froze her blood and frightened her to death, poor little shadder!
But Nancy Carey, never shy, and as eager to give herself as people always are who are born and bred in joy and love, Nancy hopped out of Mother Carey's warm nest one day, and fixing her bright eyes and sunny, hopeful glance on the lonely, frowning little neighbor, stretched out her hand in friendship.
Whatever appealed to her sense of beauty was straightway transferred to paper or canvas.
"Blamed if I know!
"Done?
Henry Lord, with the degree of p h d to his credit, had been Professor of Zoology at a New England college, but had resigned his post in order to write a series of scientific text books.
Always irritable, cold, indifferent, he had grown rapidly more so as years went on.
They have no bodies.
"Doctor of what?" asked mrs Carey.
Oh, mother, there's always so much spare room in your heart,--for you took in Julia and yet we never felt the difference,--won't you make a place for Olive?
"Why don't you do flowers and houses, Olive?" inquired Cyril solicitously.
She's wonderful!
A few moments later Nancy entered her mother's room, her arms filled with treasures from the woods and fields.
mr Popham exaggerated nothing, but on the contrary left much unsaid in his narrative of the family at the House of Lords.
It proved to be a long and intimate talk, and when mrs Carey looked out of her bedroom window just before supper she saw, at the pasture bars, the two girls with their arms round each other and their cheeks close together.
"I suppose they're easier," Olive returned with a sigh, "but who could bear to do them when there are living, breathing, moving things; things that puzzle you by looking different every minute?
"And people paint fruit, and dead fish on platters, and pitchers of lemonade with ice in,--why don't you try things like those?"
"Is the mother dead?" mrs Carey asked.
She makes effort after effort, trembling with eagerness, and when she fails to reproduce what she sees, she works herself into a frenzy of grief and disappointment."
Then the poor little shadow of a woman dropped wearily into her grave, and a certain elderly mrs Bangs, with grey hair and firm chin, came to keep house and do the work.
I wouldn't trust him to doctor a sick cat."
"What has he done to make him so unpopular?" queried mrs Carey.
A grove of poplars to the left of it only made the prospect more depressing, and if it had not been for a great sheet of water near by, floating with cow lilies and pond lilies, the whole aspect of the place would have been unspeakably dreary.
It's an awful queer world!
Not that I could make a better one!
She's older than I am, but so tiny and sad and shy that she seems like a child.
"You'd better give her lessons in self control," mr Lord answered. "They are cheaper than instruction in drawing, and much more practical."
She worked, discovering laws and making rules for herself, since she had no helpers. When she could not make a rabbit or a bird look "real" on paper, she searched in her father's books for pictures of its bones.
Her only interests in life were her younger brother Cyril, delicate and timid, and in continual terror of his father,--and a passion for drawing and sketching that was fairly devouring in its intensity.
"People don't have to be doctors of medicine," interrupted Gilbert. "Grandfather was Alexander Carey, l l.D.,--Doctor of Laws, that is."
"If you don't work hard you can't keep up with the times!
The Carey children had only found it by accident.
He keeps the thou shalt not commandments first rate, Hen Lord does!
Her hand, so marvellously full of skill, had never held another's, and she was desperately self conscious; but magnetism flowed from Nancy as electric currents from a battery.
mr Popham laid down his brush.
"You won't never see nothin' of 'em," said mr Popham.
Her gloomy young heart was visited by frequent storms and she looked as unlovable as she was unloved.
One afternoon Nancy and Kathleen had walked up the road in search of pastures new, and had spied down in a distant hollow a gloomy grey house almost surrounded by cedars.
A lonelier creature than Olive Lord at sixteen could hardly be imagined. She was a tiny thing for her years, with a little white oval face and peaked chin, pronounced eyebrows, beautifully arched, and a mass of tangled, untidy dark hair.
O! Cyril, there must be some better way of doing; I just draw the outline of an animal and then I put hairs or feathers on it.
Then for the three years before her mother's death there had been surreptitious lessons from a Portland teacher, paid for out of mr Lord's house allowance; for one of his chief faults was an incredible parsimony, amounting almost to miserliness.
The first interview, purely a casual one, took place on the edge of the lily pond where Olive was sketching frogs, and where Nancy went for cat o'-nine tails.
They couldn't run nor move; they're just pasteboard."
"She is wild to know how to do things.
Nancy's curly chestnut crop shone in the sun, and Olive's thick black plaits looked blacker by contrast.
Have you ever lifted a stone and seen the pale, yellow, stunted shoots of grass under it?
Sandford shook his head.
"What can you mean by that, Miss Woodley?
"But for what my passions now dictate," continued he, "I will not answer.
The rapid emotion of varying passions, which immediately darted over his features, informed Miss Woodley that her secret was discovered-she hid her face, while the tears that fell down to her bosom, confirmed the truth of his suggestion, beyond what oaths could have done.
Lord Elmwood laid down the newspaper to attend to her.
Miss Woodley was going to say something farther, but as if incapable of attending to her, he hastened out of the room.
"My Lord, Miss Milner's taste is not a depraved one; it is but too refined."
"I will make no unjust use of what I know," he replied with firmness.
Yet I cannot but lament that I am not as well informed as you are.
"Miss Milner's health is not good!" said mrs Horton a few minutes after.
Lord Elmwood was sensible of the embarrassment his presence gave Miss Woodley, and understood the reproaches which she seemed to vent upon herself in silence.
You talk mysteriously.
"For God's sake take care what you are doing-you are destroying my prospects of futurity-you are making this world too dear to me."
"But she would account it an injury."
"So there is to me!" added Sandford, with a sarcastic sneer.
"Great as my friendship is, there are certainly bounds to it-bounds that shall save her in spite of herself:"--and he raised his voice.
"I am glad to hear it," he returned quickly; "for although I am not of a suspicious nature, yet in regard to her affections for him, I cannot but still have my doubts."
I am not only proper from character, but from circumstances, to be relied upon-my interest is so nearly connected with the interest, and my happiness with the happiness of my ward, that those principles, as well as my honour, would protect her against every peril arising from my being trusted."
Is she not afraid that I will thwart her inclinations?"
To relieve her from both, he laid his hand with force upon his heart, and said, "Do you believe me?"
Miss Woodley was too little versed in the subject, to know, this would have been not to love at all; at least, not to the extent of breaking through engagements, and all the various obstacles that still militated against their union.
They are confused-they are triumphant at present.
Again he searched his own thoughts; nor ineffectually as before.
"Perhaps I am mistaken," answered she.
I have never yet, however, been vanquished by them; and even upon this occasion, my reason shall combat them to the last-and my reason shall fail me, before I do wrong."
"Then must the person be unworthy of her."
"I think, Miss Woodley, Miss Milner was extremely to blame, though I did not chuse to tell her so before mr Sandford, in giving Lord Frederick an opportunity of speaking to her, unless she means that he shall renew his addresses."
"Why so?" said he, warmly.
He was going to leave the room-she followed him, and cried, "But, my Lord, how shall I see again the unhappy object of my treachery?"
"We are not judges of what belongs to ourselves," he replied-"I am transported at the tidings you have revealed, and yet, perhaps, I had better never have heard them."
I wish to prove my friendship to Miss Milner, but she will not suffer me-and every step that I take for her happiness, I take in the most perplexing uncertainty."
Thank you, from my heart, for your love; you will never know, perhaps, how much it is to me.'
And she threw her arms round her cousin's neck, and brave Rachel at last burst into tears.
'Better to day, Tamar?' enquired this grand and beautiful young lady.
You resemble me, Rachel: you are fearless and inflexible and generous.
'Yes,' said Rachel.
Of Mark Wylder I say this: his name has been for years hateful to me, and recently it has become frightful; and you will promise me simply this, that you will never ask me to speak again about him.
She seized it; she clung to it.
'Rachel, dear, I'm so glad to see you,' said Dorcas, placing her arms gently about her neck, and kissing her twice or thrice.
Dorcas returned her gaze with one of haughty amazement; and Rachel said,
It was not very much past eleven that morning when the pony carriage from Brandon drew up before the little garden wicket of Redman's Farm.
Rachel's pale and sharpened features and dilated eye struck her with a painful surprise.
I like to call you cousin-kindred is so pleasant.
Oh! Dorcas, darling, don't forsake me; I am very lonely here and my spirits are gone and I never needed kindness so much before.'
'I like you still, Rachel; I'm sure I'll always like you.
We will make a little tour together, when all this shall have blown over, in a few weeks, and choose our retreat; and with the winter's snow we'll vanish from Brandon, and appear with the early flowers at our cottage among the beautiful woods and hills of Wales.
'You have been more ill than I thought, darling, and you are still far from quite recovered.'
She spoke with a sudden energy, which partook of fear and passion, and flushed her thin cheek, and made her languid eyes flash.
'I made you a voluntary promise, Dorcas, and now you will make me one.
'Thank you, Rachel, my Cousin Rachel, my only friend.
Will you come, Rachel?'
'You have heard, of course, of mr Wylder's absence?'
'You have been so ill, my poor Rachel.'
'I'm only disappointed, Rachel; I thought you would have trusted me, as I did you.'
'Can I conjecture why he is gone?' murmured Rachel, still gazing with a wild kind of apathy into distance.
'I don't understand his absence.
There was something of sweetness and fondness in her tones and manner, which was new to Rachel, and comforting, and she returned the greeting as kindly, and felt more like her former self.
'Thank you, Dorcas, dear.
'I don't think, Rachel dear, you heard me?' said Dorcas.
The young queen looked on her kindly, but sadly, through her large, strange eyes, clouded with a presage of futurity, and she kissed her again, and said-
Be he near, or be he far, I regard his very name with horror.'
Poor Rachel! her nature recoiled from deceit, and she told, at all events, as much of the truth as she dared.
'Dorcas, you are changed; have I lost your love for asking so poor a kindness?'
I was wounded to find you had thoughts you would not trust to me; but I have made the promise, and I'll keep it; and I love you all the same.'
But poor Rachel Lake had more than that stoical hypocrisy which enables the tortured spirits of her sex to lift a pale face through the flames and smile.
If he does not return in a day or two, Chelford, I am sure, will speak to me, and then I shall tell him my resolution.'
I ought not to have doubted you,' and she kissed her again.
Dorcas, in her strange way, was moved.
Remember I am neither well nor happy, and forgive what you cannot like in me.
'Rachel, dear, I have a plan for you and me: we shall be old maids, you and I, and live together like the ladies of Llangollen, careless and happy recluses.
So there came a step and a little rustling of feminine draperies, the small door opened, and Rachel entered, with her hand extended, and a pale smile of welcome.
She was up and dressed, and this moment coming down, and would be very happy to see Miss Brandon, if she would step into the drawing room.
She was sanguine, she was genial and companionable, and her spirits rose at the sight of a friendly face.
'I shall soon be as well as I am ever likely to be-that is, quite well,' answered Rachel.
CHAPTER twenty four.
At sight of this castle or cottage in the air, Rachel lighted up.
Dorcas's large eyes rested upon her with a grave enquiry, and then Miss Brandon looked down in silence for a while on the carpet, and was thinking a little sternly, maybe, and with a look of pain, still holding Rachel's hand, she said, with a sad sort of reproach in her tone,
Yes, Rachel, I do love you.
DORCAS BRANDON PAYS RACHEL A VISIT.
They sat down side by side, and Dorcas held her hand.
I have very few to love me now, and I thought you might love me, as I have begun to love you.
It was escape-flight from Gylingden-flight from Brandon-flight from Redman's Farm: they and all their hated associations would be far behind, and that awful page in her story, not torn out, indeed, but gummed down as it were, and no longer glaring and glowering in her eyes every moment of her waking life.
I'll let Brandon and abdicate.
'Chelford had a note from mr Wylder this morning-another note-his coming delayed, and something of his having to see some person who is abroad,' continued Dorcas, after a little pause.
I meant to speak to him and end all between us; and I would now write, but there is no address to his letters.
Yes, we sometimes conjecture right, and sometimes wrong; there are many things best not conjectured about at all-some interesting, some abominable, some that pass all comprehension: I never mean to conjecture, if I can help it, again.'
It was a hope.
'Rachel, dear, you have not told my secret?'
'Maybe, Rachel dear, you would like to drive a little?'
The sun glimmered through the boughs behind her; her face was in shade, and its delicate chiselling was brought out in soft reflected lights; and old Tamar looked on her in a sort of wonder, her beauty seemed so celestial and splendid.
'No, darling, not yet; it is very good of you.'
That spirit belongs to the blood of our strange race; all our women were so.
'No, indeed, Dorcas-never, and never will; and I think, though I have learned to fear death, I would rather die than let Stanley even suspect it.'
And the wan oracle having spoken, she sate down in the same sort of abstraction again beside Dorcas, and she looked full in her cousin's eyes.
I think Lady Chelford and her son begin to think there is more in this oddly timed journey of mr Wylder's than first appeared. When I came into the parlour this morning I knew they were speaking of it.
Miss Brandon took old Tamar's hand gently and pressed it.
'You have been very kind.
I suppose she was glad and took this way of showing it; and tall, beautiful, graceful, in rustling silks, she glided into the tiny drawing room silently, and sate down softly by the window, looking out upon the flowers and the falling leaves, mottled in light and shadow.
I've heard of your coming here, and sending, so often.'
'It is an antipathy-an antipathy I cannot get over, dear Dorcas; you may think it a madness, but don't blame me.
And Wylder laughed again, and began to whistle very low-not, I fancy, for want of thought, but as a sort of accompaniment thereto, for he suddenly said-
And Wylder laughed too, more suddenly and noisily than the humour of the joke seemed quite to call for, and glanced a grim look from the corners of his eyes on Lake, but the gallant captain did not seem to perceive it; and after a few seconds more he handed it very innocently back to mrs Dorothy, only remarking-
I don't know anything about him almost; but I hate him.'
I was always afraid of him; in a long peruke, and dark red velvet coat, facing the hall door.
'I don't know; but I think he mentioned Larkins's house, didn't he?
I don't think he's much of a sportsman.'
'Mine, indeed!' laughed poor little mrs Dorothy. 'Well, dear me, no, indeed;'--and in an earnest whisper close in his ear-'a present to Miss Brandon, and the donor is not a hundred miles away from your elbow, my lord!' and she winked slyly, and laughed, with a little nod at Wylder.
It was not proved, only thought likely, which showed what a nice character he was; but he might have done worse.
'He's not a man for country quarters!
Look at it, do, mr Wylder-isn't it like the ace of hearts?'
Have you seen it, Captain Lake?' And he placed it in that gentleman's fingers, who now took his turn at the lamp, and contemplated the little parallelogram with a gleam of sly amusement.
THE ACE OF HEARTS.
he'll soon be back in town, or to Brighton,' I said.
And Wylder chuckled angrily, and the small change in his pocket tinkled fiercely, as his eye glanced on the graceful captain, who was entertaining the ladies, no doubt, very agreeably in the distance.
'What the d- has he come down here for?
Whatever Lord Chelford said, Miss Brandon received it very graciously, and even with a momentary smile.
He's a very gentlemanlike fellow and your cousin.'
'That?
Oh!
I'm bad at genealogies.
I see-to be sure-really, Wylder, it does your taste infinite credit.'
The captain appeared quite easy and cheerful; but Mark, I thought, notwithstanding his laughter and general jollity, was uncomfortable; and I saw him once or twice, when Stanley's eye was not upon him, glance sharply on the young man with an uneasy and not very friendly curiosity.
I thought of the 'Fair Brunnisende,' with the captive knight in the hands of her seneschal before her, and I fancied he said something of having found him trespassing in her town, and brought him up for judgment.
'I'm glad you like it,' says Wylder, chuckling benignantly on it, over his shoulder.
When Lord Chelford joined us, I perceived that Wylder was in the room, and saw a very cordial greeting between him and Lake.
'You know Captain Lake?' said Lord Chelford, addressing me.
He was going to marry the gamekeeper's daughter, it was thought, and he and the old boy, who was for high blood, and all that, were at loggerheads about it.
'And where is he staying?'
It can't be for money, or balls, or play, and he has no honest business anywhere.
My mother could tell us all about it-we, Brandons, Lakes; Wylders, and Chelfords.'
I took a dislike to him at first sight long ago, and that never happened me but I was right.'
'Why should you, though?
I often thought since that he had expected to see Wylder before him.
So Chelford led Stanley Lake before the lady of the castle.
'By the bye, Wylder, you know the pictures here; who is the tall man, with the long pale face, and wild phosphoric eyes?
I forget all the other good things he did; but he ended by shooting himself through the head in his bed room, and that was not the worst thing ever he did.'
It's well to be distinguished in any line.
She arrested the file of gentlemen just by a large lamp, before whose effulgence she presented the subject of her eulogy-one of those costly trifles which announce the approach of Hymen, as flowers spring up before the rosy steps of May.
I'm not quite sure.'
'What are you laughing at?' asked Wylder, a little snappishly.
It is such a darling little thing; and-look now-is not it magnificent?'
'Never mind, Wylder, it's the winning card,' said Lord Chelford, laying his hand on his shoulder.
'Fie, Lake, there's no poetry in you,' said Lord Chelford, laughing.
Oh, I know-that's Lorne Brandon.
'I believe, Charlie,' he recommenced suddenly, 'there is not such an unnatural family on record as ours; is there?
Well, it was pretty-French, I dare say-a little set of tablets-a toy-the cover of enamel, studded in small jewels, with a slender border of symbolic flowers, and with a heart in the centre, a mosaic of little carbuncles, rubies, and other red and crimson stones, placed with a view to light and shade.
Do you know?'
Her conversation was lively, and rather bold, not at all in the coarse sense, but she struck me as having formed a system of ethics and views of life, both good humoured and sarcastic, and had carried into her rustic sequestration the melancholy and precocious lore of her early London experience.
At dinner Lake was easy and amusing.
At this moment Miss Brandon entered, with her brilliant Cousin Rachel. The blonde and the dark, it was a dazzling contrast.
It seemed to me to indicate a great deal more than mere indifference-something of aversion, and nearer to a positive emotion than anything I had yet seen in that exquisitely apathetic face.
And Lake turned round upon me, a little abruptly, his odd yellowish eyes, a little like those of the sea eagle, and the ghost of his smile that flickered on his singularly pale face, with a stern and insidious look, confronted me.
I don't know who's my cousin, or who isn't; nor you don't, who've been for ten years over those d-d papers; but I think he's the nastiest dog I ever met.
'Yes.'
I glanced round for Wylder, but he was not there.
Wylder looked confoundedly angry and flustered, standing with his heels on the edge of the rug, his hands in his pockets, jingling some silver there, and glancing from under his red forehead sternly and unsteadily across the room.
Wylder was laughing rather redly, with the upper part of his face very surly, I thought.
The church yard meteor expired, there was nothing in a moment but his ordinary smile of recognition.
'Is this yours, mrs Wylder?'
'Now, here's a thing worth your looking at!
There was something evil and shrinking in his aspect, which I felt with a sort of chill, like the commencing fascination of a serpent.
That meal passed off rather pleasantly; and when we joined the ladies in the drawing room, the good vicar's enthusiastic little wife came to meet us, in one of her honest little raptures.
That's all.'
I wonder she did not smile oftener, it became her so. But her greeting to Captain Lake was more than usually haughty and frozen, and her features, I fancied, particularly proud and pale.
I suppose Miss Partridge would have had a precious lot of babbies; and who knows where the estate would have been by this time.'
Whereupon Lake laughed quietly, still looking on the ace of hearts with his sly eyes.
'Shake hands with your cousin, my dear,' said old Lady Chelford, peremptorily.
Just to get him off this unpleasant groove with a little jolt, I said-
I really can't tell; but he'll soon tire of country life.
'Lake?
A devil in a family now and then is not such a bad thing, when there's work for him.' (All the time he was talking to me his angry little eyes were following Lake.) 'They say he killed his son, a blackguard, who was found shot, with his face in the tarn in the park.
'Who?--Lake?'
Old women always like rascals.'
I was vexed with myself for having managed with so little skill a conversation which, opened so oddly and frankly, might have placed me on relations so nearly confidential, with that singular and beautiful girl. I ought to have rejoiced-but we don't always see what most concerns our peace.
Its curtains were of thick and faded tapestry.
She provokes me.'
'Did you see that?' said Wylder in my ear, with a chuckle; and, wagging his head, he added, rather loftily for him, 'Miss Brandon, I reckon, has taken your measure, Master Stanley, as well as i I wonder what the deuce the old dowager sees in him.
'Really, Radie, you're enough to frighten a poor fellow; you won't mind a word I say, and go on predicting all manner of mischief between me and Wylder, the very nature of which I can't surmise.
'Very wise-exactly.
'Why-what has Sir Harry done?
The fact is, Captain Lake, an accomplished player, made a pretty little revenue of Sir Harry's billiards, which were wild and noisy; and liking his money, thought he liked himself-a confusion not uncommon.
Miss Rachel only glanced across her mufflers on his face.
I suppose the balance of attraction and repulsion was overcome by Miss Lake, much as he disliked Stanley, for Wylder followed them out with Lord Chelford, to help the young lady into her cloak and goloshes, and I found myself near Miss Brandon for the first time that evening, and much to my surprise she was first to speak, and that rather strangely.
I was always a lover of such antiquities, but I confess at that moment I would have vastly preferred a sprightly modern chintz and a trumpery little French bed in a corner of the Brandon Arms.
'Now that's impossible, Radie; for I really don't think I once thought of him all this evening-except just while we were talking.'
But don't these very wise things sometimes turn out very foolishly?
'There can hardly be a second opinion, Miss Brandon; I think it a very wise measure,' I replied, much surprised.
'You seem to be very sensible, mr De Cresseron; pray tell me, frankly, what do you think of all this?'
Their walk continued silent for the greater part, neither was quite satisfied with the other.
To my mind there has always been something inexpressibly awful in family feuds.
There was a bright moonlight, broken by the shadows of overhanging boughs and withered leaves; and the mottled lights and shadows glided oddly across his pale features.
When I heard the servant's step traversing that long gallery, as it seemed to the in haste to be gone, and when all grew quite silent, I began to feel a dismal sort of sensation, and lighted the pair of wax candles which I found upon the small writing table.
And he added something still less complimentary.
My cigar case was a resource.
Miss Lake declined the carriage to night.
All the furniture belonged to other times.
Mark my words, you'll find him too strong for you; aye, and too deep.
What I say is altogether on your own account.
If a fellow's been a little bit wild, he's Beelzebub at once. Bracton's a very good fellow, I can assure you.'
I peeped through the dense window curtain there were no shutters.
Would you dislike my smoking a cigar, Radie?'
She was so unreserved, it seemed, and yet in this directness there was something almost contemptuous.
'It is very happy, for her at least, they are not,' said Rachel, and a long silence ensued.
They had not walked far, when Lake suddenly said-
'I don't think they pretend to like one another.
Its four posts were, like the rest of it, oak, well nigh black, fantastically turned and carved, with a great urn like capital and base, and shaped midway, like a gigantic lance handle.
I did not even take the precaution of smoking up the chimney.
I was not a bit afraid of being found out.
'But I thought she liked Sir Harry Bracton: he's a good looking fellow; and Queen's Bracton is a very nice thing, you know.'
A little bit of plaster tumbled down the chimney, and startled me confoundedly.
It was one of many, opening upon the long gallery, which had been the scene, four generations back, of that unnatural and bloody midnight duel which had laid one scion of this ancient house in his shroud, and driven another a fugitive to the moral solitudes of a continental banishment.
You have given him time enough.
'I really don't think Wylder cares twopence about her, or she about him,' and Stanley Lake laughed gently and sleepily.
I boldly lighted my cheroot.
'Really, Radie, you're quite mistaken.
You were always the same, close, dark, and crooked, and wise in your own conceit.
In the meantime, Miss Lake, with her hand on her brother's arm, was walking swiftly under the trees of the back avenue towards that footpath which, through wild copse and broken clumps near the park, emerges upon the still darker road which passes along the wooded glen by the mills, and skirts the little paling of the recluse lady's garden.
'Yes, so they said; but that would, I think, have been worse.
'I take that for granted: in the nature of things it can hardly be otherwise,' I replied, a good deal startled and perplexed by the curious audacity of her interrogatory.
By this time Lord Chelford and Wylder returned; and, disgusted rather with myself, I ruminated on my want of general ship.
The portion of it which the carpet did not cover showed it to be oak, dark and rugged.
It is quite understood. It was all, you know, old Lady Chelford's arrangement: and Dorcas is so supine, I believe she would allow herself to be given away by anyone, and to anyone, rather than be at the least trouble.
The chapel lay full in view, where so many of the, strange and equivocal race, under whose ancient roof tree I then stood, were lying under their tombstones.
'I, Radie?' he answered quietly, 'why on earth should you think so?'
CHAPTER eleven.
Something may be made of Mark Wylder.
Whatever you meditate, he probably anticipates it-you know best-and you will find him prepared.
But Rachel at last said-
Somehow, I had grown nervous.
I assure you, upon my honour, I've no secret.
The sombre old trees, like gigantic hearse plumes, black and awful.
Do you really think your friend, mr Wylder, cares about me?'
To burn without ceasing to fly,--therein lies the marvel of genius.
To teach reading, means to light the fire; every syllable spelled out sparkles.
Thoughtful minds make but little use of the phrase: the fortunate and the unfortunate.
Why, argot is horrible!
Who denies that?
And so it goes on.
Man is not a circle with a single centre; he is an ellipse with a double focus.
Even dialect, let that pass!
In this guise it becomes horrible.
It is the language of prisons, galleys, convicts, of everything that is most abominable in society!" etc, etc
How! Argot!
Since when has malady banished medicine?
Who are we ourselves?
Nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in its nudity, in the broad light of thought, of the horrible swarming of slang.
This service Plautus rendered, consciously or unconsciously, by making two Carthaginian soldiers talk Phoenician; that service Moliere rendered, by making so many of his characters talk Levantine and all sorts of dialects.
Are you what is called a happy man?
There is hardly one day out of a hundred which is wholly joyous and sunny.
It is so made, that everywhere we feel the sense of punishment.
It gnashes and whispers, completing the gloom with mystery.
To keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion, to hold above the gulf, were it but a fragment of some language which man has spoken and which would, otherwise, be lost, that is to say, one of the elements, good or bad, of which civilization is composed, or by which it is complicated, to extend the records of social observation; is to serve civilization itself.
However, he who says light does not, necessarily, say joy.
Where are we at this moment?
What is slang?
We have never understood this sort of objections.
Is it really the French tongue, the great human tongue?
Phoenician, very good! Levantine, quite right!
One finds it difficult to recognize.
Each day has its own great grief or its little care.
It is slang. The words are misshapen and stamped with an indescribable and fantastic bestiality.
The earth is not devoid of resemblance to a jail.
Assuredly, if the tongue which a nation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest, the language which has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention and study.
A certain school of criticism twenty years ago, which used to say: "Half of the works of Shakespeare consists of plays upon words and puns,"--talked slang.
Is the under side of civilization any less important than the upper side merely because it is deeper and more sombre?
Alas!
The classic Academician who calls flowers "Flora," fruits, "Pomona," the sea, "Neptune," love, "fires," beauty, "charms," a horse, "a courser," the white or tricolored cockade, "the rose of Bellona," the three cornered hat, "Mars' triangle,"--that classical Academician talks slang.
One perceives, without understanding it, a hideous murmur, sounding almost like human accents, but more nearly resembling a howl than an articulate word.
He would be like a philologist refusing to examine a fact in language, a philosopher hesitating to scrutinize a fact in humanity.
To meet the needs of this conflict, wretchedness has invented a language of combat, which is slang.
Let us say, moreover, parenthetically, that from a few words of what precedes a marked separation might be inferred between the two classes of historians which does not exist in our mind.
Why should one halt on the way?
Look closely at life.
Does any one think that Alighieri has any fewer things to say than Machiavelli?
The painter who says: "My grinder," the notary who says: "My Skip the Gutter," the hairdresser who says: "My mealyback," the cobbler who says: "My cub," talks slang. Strictly speaking, if one absolutely insists on the point, all the different fashions of saying the right and the left, the sailor's port and starboard, the scene shifter's court side, and garden side, the beadle's Gospel side and Epistle side, are slang.
The history of manners and ideas permeates the history of events, and this is true reciprocally.
It is black in misfortune, it is blacker still in crime; these two blacknesses amalgamated, compose slang.
They are tongues which have belonged to nations or provinces; but slang!
The flame is the enemy of the wing.
Have these historians of hearts and souls duties at all inferior to the historians of external facts?
What is slang, properly speaking?
One thinks one beholds a frightful, living, and bristling thicket which quivers, rustles, wavers, returns to shadow, threatens and glares.
She has a son, theft, and a daughter, hunger.
We may be stopped; the fact may be put to us in general terms, which is one way of attenuating it; we may be told, that all trades, professions, it may be added, all the accidents of the social hierarchy and all forms of intelligence, have their own slang.
In this world, evidently the vestibule of another, there are no fortunate.
This without reckoning in the pains of the heart.
When it is a question of probing a wound, a gulf, a society, since when has it been considered wrong to go too far? to go to the bottom?
People suffer in the light; excess burns.
It is the language which has been spoken, in France, for example, for more than four centuries, not only by a misery, but by every possible human misery.
Behold it ready to step upon the stage and to retort upon crime, and prepared for all the employments of the repertory of evil.
When you shall have learned to know, and to love, you will still suffer. The day is born in tears.
For our part, we reserve to the word its ancient and precise, circumscribed and determined significance, and we restrict slang to slang.
When one listens, by the side of honest men, at the portals of society, one overhears the dialogues of those who are on the outside. One distinguishes questions and replies.
It is the language of wretchedness.
The sugar manufacturer who says: "Loaf, clarified, lumps, bastard, common, burnt,"--this honest manufacturer talks slang.
It engenders a whole world, la pegre, for which read theft, and a hell, la pegrenne, for which read hunger.
CHAPTER one-ORIGIN
Who knows whether man is not a recaptured offender against divine justice?
All the lineaments which providence traces on the surface of a nation have their parallels, sombre but distinct, in their depths, and all convulsions of the depths produce ebullitions on the surface.
One cloud is dispelled, another forms.
Of course it does.
Facts form one of these, and ideas the other.
As for the rest of mankind, stagnating night rests upon them.
Let us have compassion on the chastised.
Slang makes one shudder!"
For, it must be stated to those who are ignorant of the case, that argot is both a literary phenomenon and a social result.
That is why we cry: Education! science!
Well! you are sad every day.
True history being a mixture of all things, the true historian mingles in everything.
To diminish the number of the shady, to augment the number of the luminous,--that is the object.
Obscurity in the atmosphere, obscurity in acts, obscurity in voices.
One thinks one hears hydras talking.
To this we reply in one word, only.
What is the use of preserving slang?
It seems, in fact, to be a sort of horrible beast made for the night which has just been torn from its cesspool.
It is unintelligible in the dark.
Slang is odious!
They constitute two different orders of facts which correspond to each other, which are always interlaced, and which often bring forth results.
Now, when has horror ever excluded study?
And you belong to that small class who are happy!
No doubt.
There it clothes itself in word masks, in metaphor rags.
One word resembles a claw, another an extinguished and bleeding eye, such and such a phrase seems to move like the claw of a crab.
"Why dost thou, tyrant, boast thyself, Thy wicked deeds to praise?"
or hath he given us any gift?
They informed the English parliament of this unexpected incident, and assured them that they had entered into no private treaty with the king.
They required him to issue orders to Oxford and to all his other garrisons, commanding their surrender to the parliament; and the king, sensible that their resistance was to very little purpose, willingly complied.
The Scottish generals and commissioners affected great surprise on the appearance of the king; and though they paid him all the exterior respect due to his dignity, they instantly set a guard upon him, under color of protection, and made him in reality a prisoner.
They were such as a captive, entirely at mercy, could expect from the most inexorable victor.
During the time that the king remained in the Scottish army at Newcastle, died the earl of Essex, the discarded, but still powerful and popular general of the parliament.
He rode before a portmanteau, and called himself Ashburnham's servant.
Yet were they little worse than what were insisted on before the battle of Naseby.
His death, in this conjuncture, was a public misfortune.
He requested a personal treaty with the parliament.
The infamy of this bargain had such an influence on the Scottish parliament, that they once voted that the king should be protected, and his liberty insisted on.
The Scottish generals would enter into no confidence with him; and still treated him with distant ceremony and feigned respect.
The parliament and the Scots laid their proposals before the king.
The parliament, though earnestly applied to by the king, refused to allow his chaplains to attend him, because they had not taken the covenant.
And though the contributions which they had levied, as well as the price of their living at free quarters, must be deducted, yet still the sum which they insisted on was very considerable.
On his journey, the whole country flocked to behold him, moved partly by curiosity, partly by compassion and affection.
He defended Raglan Castle to extremity; and opened not its gates till the middle of August.
The English commissioners, who, some days after, came to take him under their custody, were admitted to kiss his hands; and he received them with the same grace and cheerfulness as if they had travelled on no other errand than to pay court to him.
Fully sensible of the excesses to which affairs had been carried, and of the worse consequences which were still to be apprehended, he had resolved to conciliate a peace, and to remedy, as far as possible, all those ills to which, from mistake rather than any bad intentions, he had himself so much contributed.
Another preacher, after reproaching him to his face with his misgovernment, ordered this psalm to be sung:--
Great pains were taken by the Scots (and the English complied with their pretended delicacy) to make this estimation and payment of arrears appear a quite different transaction from that for the delivery of the king's person: but common sense requires that they should be regarded as one and the same.
Thus the Scottish nation underwent, and still undergo, (for such grievous stains are not easily wiped off,) the reproach of selling their king and betraying their prince for money.
Montrose also, after having experienced still more variety of good and bad fortune, threw down his arms, and retired out of the kingdom.
Have we eaten at all of the king's cost?
He was particularly attentive to the behavior of their preachers, on whom all depended.
What the parliament was most intent upon, was not their treaty with the king, to whom they paid little regard, but that with the Scots.
The marquis of Worcester, a man past eighty four, was the last in England that submitted to the authority of the parliament.
Two important points remained to be settled with that nation: their delivery of the king, and the estimation of their arrears.
But if he put the inference by without a smile it was also without irritation.
But that only made his little final auditory more compact and select, kept it, round the hearth, subject to a common thrill.
"Then your manuscript-?"
"And is the record yours?
Then he became as communicative as we could desire and indeed gave us his best reason for being so.
"I see.
He had put them in possession of Bly, which was healthy and secure, and had placed at the head of their little establishment-but below stairs only-an excellent woman, mrs Grose, whom he was sure his visitor would like and who had formerly been maid to his mother.
But it's not the first occurrence of its charming kind that I know to have involved a child.
I could write to my man and enclose the key; he could send down the packet as he finds it." It was to me in particular that he appeared to propound this-appeared almost to appeal for aid not to hesitate.
This is a LibriVox recording.
He took no notice of her; he looked at me, but as if, instead of me, he saw what he spoke of.
She conceived him as rich, but as fearfully extravagant-saw him all in a glow of high fashion, of good looks, of expensive habits, of charming ways with women.
The departing ladies who had said they would stay didn't, of course, thank heaven, stay: they departed, in consequence of arrangements made, in a rage of curiosity, as they professed, produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up.
THE TURN OF THE SCREW
"The outbreak," I returned, "will make a tremendous occasion of Thursday night;" and everyone so agreed with me that, in the light of it, we lost all attention for everything else.
You took the thing down?"
"Forty years!" Griffin put in.
He laughed for the first time.
"For dreadful-dreadfulness!"
These children were, by the strangest of chances for a man in his position-a lone man without the right sort of experience or a grain of patience-very heavily on his hands.
"With this outbreak at last."
Poor Douglas, before his death-when it was in sight-committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that, on the same spot, with immense effect, he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth.
The awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took up all his time.
"Won't YOU tell, Douglas?" somebody else inquired.
He passed his hand over his eyes, made a little wincing grimace.
"A woman's.
He quitted the fire and dropped back into his chair.
"Nobody but me, till now, has ever heard.
I can see Douglas there before the fire, to which he had got up to present his back, looking down at his interlocutor with his hands in his pockets.
Oh yes; don't grin: I liked her extremely and am glad to this day to think she liked me, too.
mrs Griffin, however, expressed the need for a little more light.
To this his answer was prompt.
He was handsome and bold and pleasant, offhand and gay and kind.
He continued to fix me.
"You'll all meet me here?"
This I took for a sign that he had himself something to produce and that we should only have to wait.
"For general uncanny ugliness and horror and pain."
She would also have, in holidays, to look after the small boy, who had been for a term at school-young as he was to be sent, but what else could be done?--and who, as the holidays were about to begin, would be back from one day to the other.
"Who was it she was in love with?"
He had been left, by the death of their parents in India, guardian to a small nephew and a small niece, children of a younger, a military brother, whom he had lost two years before.
"Everybody will stay!"
We waited in fact till two nights later; but that same evening, before we scattered, he brought out what was in his mind.
But it's rather nice, his long reticence."
"Yes-tomorrow.
Nothing at all that I know touches it."
"For sheer terror?" I remember asking.
"You'll receive the packet Thursday morning?" I inquired.
"Oh, I can't wait for the story!"
He sprang to his feet again.
"Probably not till the second post."
"I quite agree-in regard to Griffin's ghost, or whatever it was-that its appearing first to the little boy, at so tender an age, adds a particular touch.
"Well then; after dinner-"
She has been dead these twenty years.
Yes, she was in love. That is, she had been.
It appeared that the narrative he had promised to read us really required for a proper intelligence a few words of prologue. Let me say here distinctly, to have done with it, that this narrative, from an exact transcript of my own made much later, is what I shall presently give.
He had broken a thickness of ice, the formation of many a winter; had had his reasons for a long silence.
He seemed to say it was not so simple as that; to be really at a loss how to qualify it.
"The story WON'T tell," said Douglas; "not in any literal, vulgar way."
"She was a most charming person, but she was ten years older than i She was my sister's governess," he quietly said. "She was the most agreeable woman I've ever known in her position; she would have been worthy of any whatever.
"Isn't anybody going?"
He had for his own town residence a big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase; but it was to his country home, an old family place in Essex, that he wished her immediately to proceed.
If the child gives the effect another turn of the screw, what do you say to TWO children-?"
I shall have to send to town." There was a unanimous groan at this, and much reproach; after which, in his preoccupied way, he explained.
This person proved, on her presenting herself, for judgment, at a house in Harley Street, that impressed her as vast and imposing-this prospective patron proved a gentleman, a bachelor in the prime of life, such a figure as had never risen, save in a dream or an old novel, before a fluttered, anxious girl out of a Hampshire vicarage.
It was long ago, and this episode was long before.
"Because the thing had been such a scare?"
From our end of the great brown hall we heard his step on the stair; whereupon mrs Griffin spoke.
If she hadn't she wouldn't have told me.
The last story, however incomplete and like the mere opening of a serial, had been told; we handshook and "candlestuck," as somebody said, and went to bed.
It was this observation that drew from Douglas-not immediately, but later in the evening-a reply that had the interesting consequence to which I call attention. Someone else told a story not particularly effective, which I saw he was not following.
"You ARE acute.
"Well, if I don't know who she was in love with, I know who HE was."
It was almost the tone of hope.
"We say, of course," somebody exclaimed, "that they give two turns!
"She was ten years older," said her husband.
I was sure; I could see.
One could easily fix his type; it never, happily, dies out.
She had never told anyone.
I took that HERE"--he tapped his heart. "I've never lost it."
She was in love."
I adjured him to write by the first post and to agree with us for an early hearing; then I asked him if the experience in question had been his own.
Then as he faced us again: "I can't begin.
"More's the pity, then.
"Oh, how delicious!" cried one of the women.
"Well then," I said, "just sit right down and begin."
The first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tale at a point after it had, in a manner, begun.
"You'll easily judge," he repeated: "YOU will."
It's in a locked drawer-it has not been out for years.
"The story's written.
It's quite too horrible." This, naturally, was declared by several voices to give the thing the utmost price, and our friend, with quiet art, prepared his triumph by turning his eyes over the rest of us and going on: "It's beyond everything.
He turned round to the fire, gave a kick to a log, watched it an instant.

Also, a draft on futurity, sometimes honored, but generally extended.
Presents and feasts had probably another origin than that of naive ostentation, but they required their utility for this purpose very early, and they have retained that character to the present; so that their utility in this respect has now long been the substantial ground on which these usages rest.
High bred manners and ways of living are items of conformity to the norm of conspicuous leisure and conspicuous consumption.
He is no longer simply the successful, aggressive male,--the man of strength, resource, and intrepidity.
Closely related to the requirement that the gentleman must consume freely and of the right kind of goods, there is the requirement that he must know how to consume them in a seemly manner.
The livery becomes obnoxious to nearly all who are required to wear it.
The same invidious distinction adds force to the current disapproval of any indulgence of this kind on the part of women, minors, and inferiors.
As the group whose good esteem is to be secured in this way grows larger, more patent means are required to indicate the imputation of merit for the leisure performed, and to this end uniforms, badges, and liveries come into vogue.
This most primitive differentiation in the consumption of goods is like the later differentiation with which we are all so intimately familiar, in that it is largely of a ceremonial character, but unlike the latter it does not rest on a difference in accumulated wealth.
Vicarious consumption by dependents bearing the insignia of their patron or master narrows down to a corps of liveried menials.
They become his courtiers or retainers, servants; and being fed and countenanced by their patron they are indices of his rank and vicarious consumer of his superfluous wealth.
The two offices last named suggest a principle of some general bearing.
He consumes vicariously for his host at the same time that he is witness to the consumption of that excess of good things which his host is unable to dispose of single handed, and he is also made to witness his host's facility in etiquette.
But facts within easy reach of any one who cares to know them go to say that the greater abstinence of women is in some part due to an imperative conventionality; and this conventionality is, in a general way, strongest where the patriarchal tradition-the tradition that the woman is a chattel-has retained its hold in greatest vigour.
In a heightened degree, therefore, the livery comes to be a badge of servitude, or rather servility.
We are yet so little removed from a state of effective slavery as still to be fully sensitive to the sting of any imputation of servility.
But already at a point in economic evolution far antedating the emergence of the lady, specialised consumption of goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a more or less elaborate system.
Therefore the base classes, primarily the women, practice an enforced continence with respect to these stimulants, except in countries where they are obtainable at a very low cost.
It has served as the norm to which consumption has tended to conform, and any appreciable departure from it is to be regarded as an aberrant form, sure to be eliminated sooner or later in the further course of development.
In the nature of things, luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisure class.
It has even happened that the name for certain diseased conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonym for "noble" or "gentle".
As regards feasts and largesses this is obvious enough, and the imputation of repute to the host or patron here takes place immediately, on the ground of common notoriety.
Costly entertainments, such as the potlatch or the ball, are peculiarly adapted to serve this end.
Whenever, as in these cases, the menial service in question has to do directly with the primary leisure employments of fighting and hunting, it easily acquires a reflected honorific character.
Infirmities induced by over indulgence are among some peoples freely recognised as manly attributes.
So many of them, however, as make up the retainer and hangers on of the patron may be classed as vicarious consumer without qualification.
This characterisation of the greater continence in the use of stimulants practised by the women of the reputable classes may seem an excessive refinement of logic at the expense of common sense.
This antipathy asserts itself even in the case of the liveries or uniforms which some corporations prescribe as the distinctive dress of their employees.
The competitor with whom the entertainer wishes to institute a comparison is, by this method, made to serve as a means to the end.
In order to avoid stultification he must also cultivate his tastes, for it now becomes incumbent on him to discriminate with some nicety between the noble and the ignoble in consumable goods.
But the economic effect of these social amenities is not therefore lessened, either in the vicarious consumption of goods or in the exhibition of difficult and costly achievements in etiquette.
But that does not remain the sole purpose of their consumption.
Since the consumption of these more excellent goods is an evidence of wealth, it becomes honorific; and conversely, the failure to consume in due quantity and quality becomes a mark of inferiority and demerit.
The custom of festive gatherings probably originated in motives of conviviality and religion; these motives are also present in the later development, but they do not continue to be the sole motives.
The canon of reputability is at hand and seizes upon such innovations as are, according to its standard, fit to survive.
The aid of friends and competitors is therefore brought in by resorting to the giving of valuable presents and expensive feasts and entertainments.
Under the tabu, certain victuals, and more particularly certain beverages, are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class.
In a sense which has been greatly qualified in scope and rigour, but which has by no means lost its meaning even yet, this tradition says that the woman, being a chattel, should consume only what is necessary to her sustenance,--except so far as her further consumption contributes to the comfort or the good repute of her master.
The wearers of uniforms and liveries may be roughly divided into two classes the free and the servile, or the noble and the ignoble.
The objection of course presents itself that expenditure on women's dress and household paraphernalia is an obvious exception to this rule; but it will appear in the sequel that this exception is much more obvious than substantial.
Those who stand near the higher and the highest grades of the wealthy leisure class, in point of birth, or in point of wealth, or both, outrank the remoter born and the pecuniarily weaker.
In the earlier phases of the predatory culture the only economic differentiation is a broad distinction between an honourable superior class made up of the able bodied men on the one side, and a base inferior class of labouring women on the other.
In what has been said of the evolution of the vicarious leisure class and its differentiation from the general body of the working classes, reference has been made to a further division of labour,--that between the different servant classes.
Of course the distinction is not observed with strict consistency in practice; the less debasing of the base services and the less honorific of the noble functions are not infrequently merged in the same person.
This restriction tends to disappear, at least formally, after the later peaceable stage has been reached, with private ownership of goods and an industrial system based on wage labour or on the petty household economy.
Hence results a class of impecunious gentlemen of leisure, incidentally referred to already. These half caste gentlemen of leisure fall into a system of hierarchical gradations.
But during the earlier quasi peaceable stage, when so many of the traditions through which the institution of a leisure class has affected the economic life of later times were taking form and consistency, this principle has had the force of a conventional law.
He becomes a connoisseur in creditable viands of various degrees of merit, in manly beverages and trinkets, in seemly apparel and architecture, in weapons, games, dancers, and the narcotics.
This cultivation of aesthetic faculty requires time and application, and the demands made upon the gentleman in this direction therefore tend to change his life of leisure into a more or less arduous application to the business of learning how to live a life of ostensible leisure in a becoming way.
The consumption of choice articles of food, and frequently also of rare articles of adornment, becomes tabu to the women and children; and if there is a base (servile) class of men, the tabu holds also for them.
His life of leisure must be conducted in due form.
Where the example set by the leisure class retains its imperative force in the regulation of the conventionalities, it is observable that the women still in great measure practise the same traditional continence with regard to stimulants.
During the earlier stages of economic development, consumption of goods without stint, especially consumption of the better grades of goods,--ideally all consumption in excess of the subsistence minimum,--pertains normally to the leisure class.
When the quasi peaceable stage of industry is reached, with its fundamental institution of chattel slavery, the general principle, more or less rigorously applied, is that the base, industrious class should consume only what may be necessary to their subsistence.
Many of these affiliated gentlemen of leisure are at the same time lesser men of substance in their own right; so that some of them are scarcely at all, others only partially, to be rated as vicarious consumers.
But a base service performed for a person of very high degree may become a very honorific office; as for instance the office of a Maid of Honor or of a Lady in Waiting to the Queen, or the King's Master of the Horse or his Keeper of the Hounds.
The services performed by them are likewise divisible into noble and ignoble.
The utility of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivative growth.
Any such consumption by others can take place only on a basis of sufferance.
But the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked.
The beginning of a differentiation in consumption even antedates the appearance of anything that can fairly be called pecuniary strength. It is traceable back to the initial phase of predatory culture, and there is even a suggestion that an incipient differentiation in this respect lies back of the beginnings of the predatory life.
He consumes freely and of the best, in food, drink, narcotics, shelter, services, ornaments, apparel, weapons and accoutrements, amusements, amulets, and idols or divinities. In the process of gradual amelioration which takes place in the articles of his consumption, the motive principle and proximate aim of innovation is no doubt the higher efficiency of the improved and more elaborate products for personal comfort and well-being.
The wearing of uniforms or liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence, and may even be said to be a mark of servitude, real or ostensible.
This growth of punctilious discrimination as to qualitative excellence in eating, drinking, etc presently affects not only the manner of life, but also the training and intellectual activity of the gentleman of leisure.
If these articles of consumption are costly, they are felt to be noble and honorific.
This invidious traditional distinction has not lost its force even among the more advanced peoples of today.
This differentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility.
Hence arise good manners in the way pointed out in an earlier chapter.
With a further advance in culture this tabu may change into simple custom of a more or less rigorous character; but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained, whether it be a tabu or a larger conventionality, the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily.
The latter day leisure class festivities and entertainments may continue in some slight degree to serve the religious need and in a higher degree the needs of recreation and conviviality, but they also serve an invidious purpose; and they serve it none the less effectually for having a colorable non invidious ground in these more avowable motives.
Conspicuous consumption of valuable goods is a means of reputability to the gentleman of leisure.
The consumption of luxuries, in the true sense, is a consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself, and is, therefore, a mark of the master.
On the other hand, those employments which properly fall to the industrious class are ignoble; such as handicraft or other productive labor, menial services and the like.
As wealth accumulates on his hands, his own unaided effort will not avail to sufficiently put his opulence in evidence by this method.
Drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the free use of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become honorific, as being a mark, at the second remove, of the superior status of those who are able to afford the indulgence.
It is an adaption to a new end, by a selective process, of a distinction previously existing and well established in men's habits of thought.
With many qualifications-with more qualifications as the patriarchal tradition has gradually weakened-the general rule is felt to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters.
From archaic times down through all the length of the patriarchal regime it has been the office of the women to prepare and administer these luxuries, and it has been the perquisite of the men of gentle birth and breeding to consume them.
As wealth accumulates, the leisure class develops further in function and structure, and there arises a differentiation within the class. There is a more or less elaborate system of rank and grades.
Such consumption as falls to the women is merely incidental to their work; it is a means to their continued labour, and not a consumption directed to their own comfort and fulness of life.
In the narrower sphere of vicarious leisure a similar change has gone forward.
The early ascendency of leisure as a means of reputability is traceable to the archaic distinction between noble and ignoble employments. Leisure is honorable and becomes imperative partly because it shows exemption from ignoble labor.
Under the simple test of effectiveness for advertising, we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary emulation pretty evenly between them at the outset.
This latter day uneasy reaching out for some form of purposeful activity that shall at the same time not be indecorously productive of either individual or collective gain marks a difference of attitude between the modern leisure class and that of the quasi peaceable stage.
A standard of life would still be possible which should admit of invidious comparison in other respects than that of opulence; as, for instance, a comparison in various directions in the manifestation of moral, physical, intellectual, or aesthetic force.
The use of the word "waste" as a technical term, therefore, implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends sought by the consumer under this canon of conspicuous waste.
When the community developed into a peaceful industrial organization, and when fuller occupation of the land had reduced the opportunities for the hunt to an inconsiderable residue, the pressure of energy seeking purposeful employment was left to find an outlet in some other direction.
But the fact that it may under stress of circumstances eventuate in inanities no more disproves the presence of the instinct than the reality of the brooding instinct is disproved by inducing a hen to sit on a nestful of china eggs.
The ignominy which attaches to useful effort also entered upon a less acute phase with the disappearance of compulsory labor; and the instinct of workmanship then came to assert itself with more persistence and consistency.
A reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is effected by a resort to make believe.
But the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme.
This alien factor is the instinct of workmanship.
The instinct of workmanship is present in all men, and asserts itself even under very adverse circumstances.
No merit would accrue from the consumption of the bare necessaries of life, except by comparison with the abjectly poor who fall short even of the subsistence minimum; and no standard of expenditure could result from such a comparison, except the most prosaic and unattractive level of decency.
As seen from the point of view of the individual consumer, the question of wastefulness does not arise within the scope of economic theory proper.
So that however wasteful a given expenditure may be in reality, it must at least have some colorable excuse in the way of an ostensible purpose.
The subsequent relative decline in the use of conspicuous leisure as a basis of repute is due partly to an increasing relative effectiveness of consumption as an evidence of wealth; but in part it is traceable to another force, alien, and in some degree antagonistic, to the usage of conspicuous waste.
The use of the term "waste" is in one respect an unfortunate one.
The archaic differentiation into noble and ignoble classes is based on an invidious distinction between employments as honorific or debasing; and this traditional distinction grows into an imperative canon of decency during the early quasi peaceable stage. Its ascendency is furthered by the fact that leisure is still fully as effective an evidence of wealth as consumption.
In order to meet with unqualified approval, any economic fact must approve itself under the test of impersonal usefulness-usefulness as seen from the point of view of the generically human.
Consumable goods, and even productive goods, generally show the two elements in combination, as constituents of their utility; although, in a general way, the element of waste tends to predominate in articles of consumption, while the contrary is true of articles designed for productive use.
Leisure held the first place at the start, and came to hold a rank very much above wasteful consumption of goods, both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency, during the quasi peaceable culture.
But there are other standards of repute and other, more or less imperative, canons of conduct, besides wealth and its manifestation, and some of these come in to accentuate or to qualify the broad, fundamental canon of conspicuous waste.
As items which sometimes fall under this head, and are therefore available as illustrations of the manner in which this principle applies, may be cited carpets and tapestries, silver table service, waiter's services, silk hats, starched linen, many articles of jewelry and of dress.
In order to be reputable it must be wasteful.
Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods or of services or human life, runs the obvious implication that in order to effectually mend the consumer's good fame it must be an expenditure of superfluities.
For this is the basis of award of the instinct of workmanship, and that instinct is the court of final appeal in any question of economic truth or adequacy.
All extraneous considerations apart, those persons (adult) are but a vanishing minority today who harbor no inclination to the accomplishment of some end, or who are not impelled of their own motion to shape some object or fact or relation for human use.
It is a question as to the award rendered by a dispassionate common sense.
This extreme inhibition of industry is avoided because slave labor, working under a compulsion more vigorous than that of reputability, is forced to turn out a product in excess of the subsistence minimum of the working class.
And along with the make believe of purposeful employment, and woven inextricably into its texture, there is commonly, if not invariably, a more or less appreciable element of purposeful effort directed to some serious end.
Indeed, so effective is it in the relatively small and stable human environment to which the individual is exposed at that cultural stage, that, with the aid of the archaic tradition which deprecates all productive labor, it gives rise to a large impecunious leisure class, and it even tends to limit the production of the community's industry to the subsistence minimum.
In so far as it comes into conflict with the law of conspicuous waste, the instinct of workmanship expresses itself not so much in insistence on substantial usefulness as in an abiding sense of the odiousness and aesthetic impossibility of what is obviously futile. Being of the nature of an instinctive affection, its guidance touches chiefly and immediately the obvious and apparent violations of its requirements.
The salient features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated.
Instead of simply passing her time in visible idleness, as in the best days of the patriarchal regime, the housewife of the advanced peaceable stage applies herself assiduously to household cares.
But that canon of reputability which discountenances all employment that is of the nature of productive effort is still at hand, and will permit nothing beyond the most transient vogue to any employment that is substantially useful or productive.
It is only less promptly and with less constraining force that it reaches such substantial violations of its requirements as are appreciated only upon reflection.
Other circumstances permitting, that instinct disposes men to look with favor upon productive efficiency and on whatever is of human use.
This common sense implication is itself an outcropping of the instinct of workmanship.
The test to which all expenditure must be brought in an attempt to decide that point is the question whether it serves directly to enhance human life on the whole whether it furthers the life process taken impersonally.
From that point onward, consumption has gained ground, until, at present, it unquestionably holds the primacy, though it is still far from absorbing the entire margin of production above the subsistence minimum.
Leisure might then be expected gradually to yield ground and tend to obsolescence as the economic development goes forward, and the community increases in size; while the conspicuous consumption of goods should gradually gain in importance, both absolutely and relatively, until it had absorbed all the available product, leaving nothing over beyond a bare livelihood.
If he chooses it, that disposes of the question of its relative utility to him, as compared with other forms of consumption that would not be deprecated on account of their wastefulness.
It disposes them to deprecate waste of substance or effort.
At the same time the wages in the trade are high enough to make movement from place to place relatively easy.
The only practicable means of impressing one's pecuniary ability on these unsympathetic observers of one's everyday life is an unremitting demonstration of ability to pay.
Lower still, where any degree of leisure, even ostensible, has become impracticable for the wife, the conspicuous consumption of goods remains and is carried on by the wife and children.
It is evident, therefore, that the present trend of the development is in the direction of heightening the utility of conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure.
It is rather that the leisure class scheme of life here comes to an expression at the second remove.
The exigencies of the modern industrial system frequently place individuals and households in juxtaposition between whom there is little contact in any other sense than that of juxtaposition. One's neighbors, mechanically speaking, often are socially not one's neighbors, or even acquaintances; and still their transient good opinion has a high degree of utility.
It is by no means an uncommon spectacle to find a man applying himself to work with the utmost assiduity, in order that his wife may in due form render for him that degree of vicarious leisure which the common sense of the time demands.
The requirement of conformity to this higher conventional standard becomes mandatory.
It is not that the city population is by nature much more eager for the peculiar complacency that comes of a conspicuous consumption, nor has the rural population less regard for pecuniary decency.
But the provocation to this line of evidence, as well as its transient effectiveness, is more decided in the city.
Not that the results of her attention to household matters, of a decorative and mundificatory character, are not pleasing to the sense of men trained in middle class proprieties; but the taste to which these effects of household adornment and tidiness appeal is a taste which has been formed under the selective guidance of a canon of propriety that demands just these evidences of wasted effort.
The question is, which of the two methods will most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desired to affect.
The man of the household also can do something in this direction, and indeed, he commonly does; but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence-along the margin of the slums-the man, and presently also the children, virtually cease to consume valuable goods for appearances, and the woman remains virtually the sole exponent of the household's pecuniary decency.
The human proclivity to ostentation, reenforced by sentiments of good fellowship, leads them to spend freely in those directions which will best serve these needs.
It is also noticeable that the serviceability of consumption as a means of repute, as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency, is at its best in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest.
And here occurs a curious inversion.
The result is that, in order to keep up a decent appearance, the former habitually live hand to mouth to a greater extent than the latter.
It is a fact of common observance that in this lower middle class there is no pretense of leisure on the part of the head of the household.
The inertia due to the home feeling is consequently also slight.
But the middle class wife still carries on the business of vicarious leisure, for the good name of the household and its master.
No class of society, not even the most abjectly poor, forgoes all customary conspicuous consumption.
The means of communication and the mobility of the population now expose the individual to the observation of many persons who have no other means of judging of his reputability than the display of goods (and perhaps of breeding) which he is able to make while he is under their direct observation.
With the disappearance of servitude, the number of vicarious consumers attached to any one gentleman tends, on the whole, to decrease.
The basis on which good repute in any highly organized industrial community ultimately rests is pecuniary strength; and the means of showing pecuniary strength, and so of gaining or retaining a good name, are leisure and a conspicuous consumption of goods.
Among the latter, everybody's affairs, especially everybody's pecuniary status, are known to everybody else.
Usage has answered this question in different ways under different circumstances.
Each will therefore serve about equally well during the earlier stages of social growth.
This vicarious consumption practiced by the household of the middle and lower classes can not be counted as a direct expression of the leisure class scheme of life, since the household of this pecuniary grade does not belong within the leisure class.
In descending the social scale in any modern industrial community, the primary fact the conspicuous leisure of the master of the household disappears at a relatively high point.
There is no class and no country that has yielded so abjectly before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual need.
In the modern community there is also a more frequent attendance at large gatherings of people to whom one's everyday life is unknown; in such places as churches, theaters, ballrooms, hotels, parks, shops, and the like.
If beauty or comfort is achieved and it is a more or less fortuitous circumstance if they are they must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves to the great economic law of wasted effort.
The more reputable, "presentable" portion of middle class household paraphernalia are, on the one hand, items of conspicuous consumption, and on the other hand, apparatus for putting in evidence the vicarious leisure rendered by the housewife.
The leisure rendered by the wife in such cases is, of course, not a simple manifestation of idleness or indolence.
Through force of circumstances it has fallen into disuse.
But the derivative fact the vicarious leisure and consumption rendered by the wife, and the auxiliary vicarious performance of leisure by menials remains in vogue as a conventionality which the demands of reputability will not suffer to be slighted.
On grounds of expediency the preference may be given to the one or the other at different stages of the economic development.
There goes into these domestic duties much solicitude for a proper combination of form and color, and for other ends that are to be classed as aesthetic in the proper sense of the term; and it is not denied that effects having some substantial aesthetic value are sometimes attained.
So it comes, for instance, that the American farmer and his wife and daughters are notoriously less modish in their dress, as well as less urbane in their manners, than the city artisan's family with an equal income.
The last items of this category of consumption are not given up except under stress of the direst necessity.
Very much of squalor and discomfort will be endured before the last trinket or the last pretense of pecuniary decency is put away.
In order to impress these transient observers, and to retain one's self complacency under their observation, the signature of one's pecuniary strength should be written in characters which he who runs may read.
But as we descend the social scale, the point is presently reached where the duties of vicarious leisure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone.
Pretty much all that is here insisted on is that, as regards these amenities of life, the housewife's efforts are under the guidance of traditions that have been shaped by the law of conspicuously wasteful expenditure of time and substance.
Consumption becomes a larger element in the standard of living in the city than in the country.
The result is a great mobility of the labor employed in printing; perhaps greater than in any other equally well defined and considerable body of workmen.
It almost invariably occurs disguised under some form of work or household duties or social amenities, which prove on analysis to serve little or no ulterior end beyond showing that she does not occupy herself with anything that is gainful or that is of substantial use.
These home comforts and the leisure indulged in-where the indulgence is found-are of course also in great part to be classed as items of conspicuous consumption; and much the same is to be said of the savings.
Considered by itself simply-taken in the first degree-this added provocation to which the artisan and the urban laboring classes are exposed may not very seriously decrease the amount of savings; but in its cumulative action, through raising the standard of decent expenditure, its deterrent effect on the tendency to save cannot but be very great.
The effects are pleasing to us chiefly because we have been taught to find them pleasing.
From the foregoing survey of the growth of conspicuous leisure and consumption, it appears that the utility of both alike for the purposes of reputability lies in the element of waste that is common to both. In the one case it is a waste of time and effort, in the other it is a waste of goods.
Here as elsewhere prescription seizes upon the custom as soon as it gains a vogue, and incorporates it in the accredited standard of decency.
The choice between them is a question of advertising expediency simply, except so far as it may be affected by other standards of propriety, springing from a different source.
The head of the middle class household has been reduced by economic circumstances to turn his hand to gaining a livelihood by occupations which often partake largely of the character of industry, as in the case of the ordinary business man of today.
These men are constantly thrown in contact with new groups of acquaintances, with whom the relations established are transient or ephemeral, but whose good opinion is valued none the less for the time being.
In a general way, though not wholly nor consistently, these two groups coincide.
This is especially true during the later, peaceable economic stage.
The observance of these standards, in some degree of approximation, becomes incumbent upon all classes lower in the scale.
The peculiar habits of the class in this respect are commonly set down to some kind of an ill defined moral deficiency with which this class is credited, or to a morally deleterious influence which their occupation is supposed to exert, in some unascertainable way, upon the men employed in it.
This method is therefore more readily resorted to, and in the struggle to outdo one another the city population push their normal standard of conspicuous consumption to a higher point, with the result that a relatively greater expenditure in this direction is required to indicate a given degree of pecuniary decency in the city.
The state of the case for the men who work in the composition and press rooms of the common run of printing houses may be summed up as follows. Skill acquired in any printing house or any city is easily turned to account in almost any other house or city; that is to say, the inertia due to special training is slight.
The standard of decency is higher, class for class, and this requirement of decent appearance must be lived up to on pain of losing caste.
Both are methods of demonstrating the possession of wealth, and the two are conventionally accepted as equivalents.
Among the country population its place is to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighborhood gossip sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of Pecuniary repute.
The leisure class stands at the head of the social structure in point of reputability; and its manner of life and its standards of worth therefore afford the norm of reputability for the community.
She bit her lip and looked down at her hands, which were clasped tightly in front of her.
It's getting the better of me.
She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, as if to draw in again the fragrance of those days.
He moved uneasily and his chair creaked.
"I'll do anything you wish me to, Bartley," she said tremulously.
"It's too late to ask that.
I landed at Liverpool this morning and came down on the boat train."
"Could you-could you sit down and talk about it quietly, Bartley, as if I were a friend, and not some one who had to be defied?"
Hilda took a quick, soft breath.
"You see, loving some one as I love you makes the whole world different.
I must have you to think of through the months and months of loneliness.
Bartley gave a bitter little laugh, and Hilda looked up and read in the deepening lines of his face that youth and Bartley would not much longer struggle together.
She slid to the floor beside him, as if she were too tired to sit up any longer.
At last Alexander brought out one word:--
The sight of you, Bartley, to see you living and happy and successful-can I never make you understand what that means to me?" She pressed his shoulders gently.
The first was-sort of in play, wasn't it?"
I must see you.
He locked and unlocked his hands over the grate and spread his fingers close to the bluish flame, while the coals crackled and the clock ticked and a street vendor began to call under the window.
You ask me to stay away from you because you want me!
"Yes, I know I'm cowardly. I'm afraid of myself.
He stood his ground over by the windows until Hilda came in.
Bartley, you're cowardly!"
"Everything!"
"Oh, what a grand thing to happen on a raw day!
"I can't," he said heavily.
"I meant to, but somehow I couldn't.
The shamefulness of your asking me to do that!
Alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze.
He looked at her and his haggard face softened.
Alexander did not sit down.
But I didn't know.
"What about us, Bartley?" she asked in a thin voice.
Keep away if you wish; when have I ever followed you?
"There's something troubling you, Bartley.
"Don't cry, don't cry," he whispered.
I can do that."
He dropped back heavily into his chair by the fire.
Hilda's face quivered, but she whispered: "Yes, I think it must have been.
Hilda was pale by this time, and her eyes were wide with fright.
I thought it might be Sister Kate or Cousin Mike would be happening along.
Hilda held her face back from him and began to cry bitterly.
It's different now.
I never dreamed it would be you, Bartley.
Something of their troubling sweetness came back to Alexander, too.
He pulled up a window as if the air were heavy.
What must I do that I've not done, or what must I not do?" She listened intently, but she heard nothing but the creaking of his chair.
Then came all those years without you, lonely and hurt and discouraged; those decent young fellows and poor Mac, and me never heeding-hard as a steel spring.
If I'd met you later, if I hadn't loved you so well-but that's all over, long ago.
Hilda watched him with perplexity.
If you come to me, I'll do as I see fit.
"Just something Bartley.
It tortures me every minute."
I wanted you always to be happy and handsome and successful-to have all the things that a great man ought to have, and, once in a way, the careless holidays that great men are not permitted."
"Please tell me one thing, Bartley.
The stop at Queenstown, the tedious passage up the Mersey, were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience.
She pushed him toward the big chair by the fire, and sat down on a stool at the opposite side of the hearth, her knees drawn up to her chin, laughing like a happy little girl.
I'm growing older, and you've got my young self here with you.
What I mean is that I want you to promise never to see me again, no matter how often I come, no matter how hard I beg."
You and i"
You've only to tell me now.
Bartley turned away and sank down in his chair again.
"I can't stand seeing you miserable."
He put out his hand toward her as he looked away again into the fire.
"After the very first.
You know.
It's unbearable.
Forget everything except that I am here."
"Each life spoils the other.
I felt it in my bones when I woke this morning that something splendid was going to turn up.
Bartley bent over and took her in his arms, kissing her mouth and her wet, tired eyes.
I will do anything you say-but that!
Hilda sprang up like a flame.
Alexander rose and shook himself angrily.
I will ask the least imaginable, but I must have SOMETHING!"
Bartley bent lower over the fire.
"It's got to be a clean break, Hilda.
She crept across to him, drawing her stool after her.
Come over to the fire; you're chilled through."
She blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs. Alexander paced up and down the hallway, buttoning and unbuttoning his overcoat, until she returned and took him up to Hilda's living room.
There is this deception between me and everything."
"You want to tell me that you can only see me like this, as old friends do, or out in the world among people?
But it's worse now.
"No!" she gasped.
"You want me to say it?" she whispered.
"But why NOW?" she asked piteously, wringing her hands.
The last two days of the voyage Bartley found almost intolerable.
"I got in about ten minutes ago.
She called his name on the threshold, but in her swift flight across the room she felt a change in him and caught herself up so deftly that he could not tell just when she did it. She merely brushed his cheek with her lips and put a hand lightly and joyously on either shoulder.
I won't promise.
I get nothing but misery out of either.
"You see, my mistake was in wanting you to have everything.
"I understand, Bartley.
And then you came back, not caring very much, but it made no difference."
But, if you come to me, I'll do as I see fit.
Why didn't you let me be angry with you?
And I've got nobody but you.
She rose uncertainly, touched his hair with her hand, then sank back upon her stool.
The world is all there, just as it used to be, but I can't get at it any more.
I can't see you at all, anywhere.
"Yes, yes," she hurried, pulling her hand gently away from him. Presently it stole back to his coat sleeve.
At least, tell me that you believe I thought I was making you happy."
Alexander groaned.
"We've tortured each other enough for tonight.
Emerging at Euston at half past three o'clock in the afternoon, Alexander had his luggage sent to the Savoy and drove at once to Bedford Square.
She looked at his heavy shoulders and big, determined head, thrust forward like a catapult in leash.
"It . . . it hasn't always made you miserable, has it?" Her eyelids fell and her lips quivered.
You haven't spoken a word."
Do you understand?
He rose and pushed the chair behind him and began to walk miserably about the room, seeming to find it too small for him.
"Always.
He ignored her question.
It's abominable of you to ask me.
She leaned her head against his arm and spoke softly:--
I must know about you.
I wanted you to eat all the cakes and have them, too.
I have thought about it until I am worn out."
A coal fire was crackling in the grate and the lamps were lit, for it was already beginning to grow dark outside.
I carried it all lightly enough at first, but now I don't dare trifle with it.
We had only a few days, and your new play was just on, and you were so happy."
But why do you let me chatter on like this?
She stood over him with her hands clenched at her side, her body rigid.
What is it?"
"Yes, I was happy, wasn't I?" She pressed his hand gently in gratitude. "Weren't you happy then, at all?"
Hilda shivered and sat still.
Bartley leaned his head in his hands and spoke through his teeth.
I somehow believed that I could take all the bad consequences for you.
The room was empty when he entered.
Hilda sat on the arm of it and put her hands lightly on his shoulders.
I don't trust myself any more.
She looked about desperately from Bartley to the door, then to the windows, and back again to Bartley.
She doesn't take up with anybody, you know.
In appearance, Mainhall was astonishingly like the conventional stage Englishman of American drama: tall and thin, with high, hitching shoulders and a small head glistening with closely brushed yellow hair.
The fact is, she's feeling rather seedy, poor child.
I say!
He's been wanting to marry Hilda these three years and more.
Do you know, Alexander,"--Mainhall looked with perplexity up into the top of the hansom and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved finger,--"do you know, I sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself.
"I say, Sir Harry, the little girl's going famously to night, isn't she?"
After all, we were awfully young.
A little attack of nerves, possibly."
I should torture myself-I couldn't help it." After that it was easy to forget, actually to forget.
When Alexander returned to his hotel-he shook Mainhall at the door of the theatre-he had some supper brought up to his room, and it was late before he went to bed.
"And have I done anything so fool as that, now?" he asked.
After he met Winifred Pemberton he seemed to himself like a different man.
And what an audience!
She saves her hand, too.
She doubtless hasn't thought of me for years." He felt the enthusiasm of the house at once, and in a few moments he was caught up by the current of MacConnell's irresistible comedy.
Here comes Sir Harry Towne.
Lady Westmere is very fond of Hilda."
Westmere and I were back after the first act, and we thought she seemed quite uncertain of herself.
MacConnell grunted.
She's really MacConnell's poetic motif, you see; makes the whole thing a fairy tale."
I shouldn't wonder- But they've probably spoiled her, so that she'd be tiresome if one met her again."
There's everything in seeing Hilda while she's fresh in a part.
For some reason he felt pleased and flattered by the enthusiasm of the audience.
When she began to dance, by way of showing the gossoons what she had seen in the fairy rings at night, the house broke into a prolonged uproar.
But I never thought she'd do anything.
Mainhall laughed.
Dear me, Mac, the girl couldn't possibly be better, you know."
A man writes to the top of his bent only once."
Sometimes a little jolt like that does one good.
She was a daft, generous little thing.
The audience had come forewarned, evidently, and whenever the ragged slip of a donkey girl ran upon the stage there was a deep murmur of approbation, every one smiled and glowed, and Mainhall hitched his heavy chair a little nearer the brass railing.
"It's really quite the best thing MacConnell's done," he explained as they got into a hansom.
It's only lately, since MacConnell and his set have got hold of her, that she's come up.
"Why, I haven't heard of her for-years."
"MacConnell, let me introduce mr Bartley Alexander.
As they sat down, a burst of applause drew Alexander's attention to the stage.
He had preconceived ideas about everything, and his idea about Americans was that they should be engineers or mechanics.
Sir Harry Towne, mr Bartley Alexander, the American engineer."
As Mainhall had said, she was the second act; the plot and feeling alike depended upon her lightness of foot, her lightness of touch, upon the shrewdness and deft fancifulness that played alternately, and sometimes together, in her mirthful brown eyes.
The playwright gave Mainhall a curious look out of his deep set faded eyes and made a wry face.
But Hilda Burgoyne's the hit of the piece. Hugh's written a delightful part for her, and she's quite inexpressible. It's been on only two weeks, and I've been half a dozen times already. I happen to have MacConnell's box for tonight or there'd be no chance of our getting places.
She's at her best in the second act.
One of your countrymen, Alexander, by the way; an American student whom she met in Paris, I believe.
It's going famously to night, Mac.
Blinking up at the lights, Mainhall added in his luxurious, worldly way: "She's an elegant little person, and quite capable of an extravagant bit of sentiment like that.
She's apt to grow a bit stale after a time.
"All the same," he lifted his glass, "here's to you, little Hilda.
The second act opened before Philly Doyle's underground still, with Peggy and her battered donkey come in to smuggle a load of potheen across the bog, and to bring Philly word of what was doing in the world without, and of what was happening along the roadsides and ditches with the first gleam of fine weather.
Just then they drove up to the Duke of York's, so Alexander did not commit himself, but followed Mainhall into the theatre.
Sir Harry Towne bowed and said that he had met mr Alexander and his wife in Tokyo.
She hadn't much ambition then, and she was too fond of trifles.
Alexander, annoyed by Mainhall's sighs and exclamations, watched her with keen, half skeptical interest.
When they entered the stage box on the left the first act was well under way, the scene being the interior of a cabin in the south of Ireland.
The nephew of one of the standard Victorian novelists, Mainhall bobbed about among the various literary cliques of London and its outlying suburbs, careful to lose touch with none of them.
Mainhall cut in impatiently.
Hilda had never replied to his letter.
I dare say it's quite true that there's never been any one else." Mainhall vouched for her constancy with a loftiness that made Alexander smile, even while a kind of rapid excitement was tingling through him.
He bowed as the warning bell rang, and Mainhall whispered: "You know Lord Westmere, of course,--the stooped man with the long gray mustache, talking to Lady Dowle.
It was youth and poverty and proximity, and everything was young and kindly.
It's delightful to hear it in a London theatre.
Irene Burgoyne, one of her family, told me in confidence that there was a romance somewhere back in the beginning.
Perhaps she has me to thank for something, after all.
In a way, it would be a sacrifice; but, dear me, we do need some one."
He's another who's awfully keen about her.
"He's hit terribly hard.
"Of course," he reflected, "she always had that combination of something homely and sensible, and something utterly wild and daft.
He nodded curtly and made for the door, dodging acquaintances as he went.
She must care about the theatre a great deal more than she used to.
You'll never do anything like this again, mark me.
Bartley smiled and yawned and went to bed.
He had been in London more or less, but he had never happened to hear of her.
That laugh, now, when she doubles over at the hips-who ever heard it out of Galway?
When he wrote her that everything was changed for him, he was telling the truth.
"It's tremendously well put on, too.
You've made things come your way, and I never thought you'd do it.
They met a good many acquaintances; Mainhall, indeed, knew almost every one, and he babbled on incontinently, screwing his small head about over his high collar.
He was never so witty or so sharp here as elsewhere, and Alexander thought he behaved as if he were an elderly relative come in to a young girl's party.
She did my blouses beautifully the last time I was there, and was so delighted to see me again.
Have I told you about my new play?
I don't need Marie to dress me this season, so she keeps house for me, and my little Galway girl has gone home for a visit. I should never have asked you if Molly had been here, for I remember you don't like English cookery."
You see, I'm coming on."
Good night."
I've managed to save something every year, and that with helping my three sisters now and then, and tiding poor Cousin Mike over bad seasons.
This isn't fair, you know.
Her hair is still like flax, and her blue eyes are just like a baby's, and she has the same three freckles on her little nose, and talks about going back to her bains de mer."
Hilda curtsied.
He drank it appreciatively and remarked that there was still no other he liked so well.
They don't talk of any one else as they do of you."
"Ask a theatre lady if she's afraid of drafts!" Hilda laughed.
I don't drink it myself, but I like to see it behave when it's poured.
"Aren't you afraid to let the wind low like that on your neck?
"Dear me, why did you do that?
They were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the money: "God give you a happy love!"
Hilda laughed and went over to the piano.
Alexander caught the agitation in her voice.
"It's not particularly rare," she said, "but some of it was my mother's.
"I'm so pleased that you think me worth that yellow dress, you know," he said, taking her hand and looking her over admiringly from the toes of her canary slippers to her smoothly parted brown hair.
"Are you going to let me love you a little, Bartley?" she whispered.
Too bad!
"You have traveled, you say.
"No, it isn't a dress up part.
You've got awfully nice friends," he added humbly, picking up a little jade elephant from her desk.
They have all grown very smart.
They asked him to come to see them in Chelsea, and they spoke very tenderly of Hilda.
I hope so."
Bartley recognized the primrose satin gown she had worn that first evening at Lady Walford's.
He had a long talk with MacConnell, but he got no word with Hilda alone, and he left in a discontented state of mind.
It's owing to that same chance, by the way, that I am able to ask you to dinner.
He's a big, handsome creature, and he hates Americans as much as ever.
It was not in the ingratiating tone of the habitual beggar: it had come out of the depths of the poor creature's sorrow, vibrating with pity for their youth and despair at the terribleness of human life; it had the anguish of a voice of prophecy.
It was very jolly," he murmured lazily, as Marie came in to take away the coffee.
We always had our tea out of those blue cups when I was a little girl, sometimes in the queerest lodgings, and sometimes on a trunk at the theatre-queer theatres, for that matter."
"Lady Westmere sent them to me from Rome last Christmas.
"Well, he is still clever and lazy.
What a strong brown face she had, and very tragic.
Until she spoke, Bartley had not realized that he was in love. The strange woman, and her passionate sentence that rang out so sharply, had frightened them both.
He sent up his card, but it came back to him with a message scribbled across the front.
Heaven knows how she managed to keep it whole, through all our wanderings, or in what baskets and bundles and theatre trunks it hasn't been stowed away.
Though Marie is clean-really clean, as the French are.
"Well, we are neither of us twenty now, you know.
Good night."
When they reached the house where Hilda lodged, Bartley went across the court with her, and up the dark old stairs to the third landing; and there he had kissed her for the first time.
Have you been in Paris much these late years?"
Bartley leaned over her shoulder, without touching her, and whispered in her ear: "You are giving me a chance?"
Most actresses nowadays learn to sing properly, so I tried a master; but he confused me, just!"
He found it a delightful little place and he met charming people there.
"Thank you.
Alexander arrived early, and some twenty odd people dropped in during the course of the afternoon.
I gave her all my old clothes, even my old hats, though she always wears her Breton headdress.
She caught his handkerchief from her throat and thrust it at him without turning round.
"How jolly it was being young, Hilda!
She sat down at the piano and sang.
"I have some champagne for you, too.
Hilda saw Alexander look up at it.
Alexander walked about the room, looking at everything.
There was watercress soup, and sole, and a delightful omelette stuffed with mushrooms and truffles, and two small rare ducklings, and artichokes, and a dry yellow Rhone wine of which Bartley had always been very fond.
How did her son turn out?
I was frightened at your prodigality."
Alexander walked over to the bookcases.
h b
"Indeed I do.
Hilda was writing in her living room, under the light of a tall desk lamp.
Listen."
Hilda sat down on the couch and said seriously: "I've a neat little sum in the bank, too, now, and I own a mite of a hut in Galway.
The editor of a monthly review came with his wife, and Lady Kildare, the Irish philanthropist, brought her young nephew, Robert Owen, who had come up from Oxford, and who was visibly excited and gratified by his first introduction to Miss Burgoyne.
"It's the air of the whole place here that I like.
CHAPTER four
"Here, take it.
Bartley started when Hilda rang the little bell beside her.
There aren't many such left.
"I can't tell you how glad I am to have you so pretty and comfortable here, and to hear every one saying such nice things about you.
I'm so sorry to hear it.
I would have given her some of mine off my back, if I could.
For the rest of the week he was nervous and unsettled, and kept rushing his work as if he were preparing for immediate departure.
I've no need for fine clothes in Mac's play this time, so I can afford a few duddies for myself.
Do you remember how sweet they smelled?"
Of course I can't really sing, except the way my mother and grandmother did before me.
I remember it touched me so.
Hilda lived alone, attended by a very pretty and competent French servant who answered the door and brought in the tea.
Bartley looked at Hilda across the yellow light of the candles and broke into a low, happy laugh.
"Nonsense.
Hilda seemed particularly fond of this quaint couple, and Bartley himself was so pleased with their mild and thoughtful converse that he took his leave when they did, and walked with them over to Oxford Street, where they waited for their 'bus.
He's that gifted, you know, but he will drink and loses more good engagements than other fellows ever get.
There is nothing else that looks so jolly."
And I've traveled a bit, too."
"But perhaps, as I'm so warm-give me your handkerchief.
But I don't like it so well as this." Bartley held the yellow wine against the light and squinted into it as he turned the glass slowly about.
It's not worth much, but I love it.
They're quite unusual, aren't they?"
Mac is writing one; really for me this time.
Hilda laughed and looked at him questioningly.
Every one at Lady Walford's was looking at it."
Did she ever get back to Brittany and her bains de mer?"
"Yes.
It was a tiny room, hung all round with French prints, above which ran a shelf full of china.
Hilda started up from the stool and moved restlessly toward the window. "It's really too warm in this room to sing.
We walked on down by the river, didn't we?"
Take it and go.
He painted that group of cypresses for the Salon, and it was bought for the Luxembourg."
On Thursday afternoon he cut short a committee meeting, jumped into a hansom, and drove to Bedford Square.
Don't you feel it?"
He stood a little behind her, and tried to steady himself as he said: "It's soft and misty.
On Sunday afternoon Alexander remembered Miss Burgoyne's invitation and called at her apartment.
"Oh, yes, I go over to Paris often.
They went home sadly with the lilacs, back to the Rue Saint Jacques, walking very slowly, arm in arm.
Alexander went back to Bedford Square a second Sunday afternoon.
Hilda lowered one of the candle shades carefully.
But Angel-do you remember Angel?"
When Bartley arrived at Bedford Square on Sunday evening, Marie, the pretty little French girl, met him at the door and conducted him upstairs.
He seemed to have made a resolute effort at tidiness of attire, and his sister, a robust, florid woman with a splendid joviality about her, kept eyeing his freshly creased clothes apprehensively.
"I haven't had a chance yet to tell you what a jolly little place I think this is.
You used to sing it so well."
For a long time neither Hilda nor Bartley spoke.
Sarah Frost, the novelist, came with her husband, a very genial and placid old scholar who had become slightly deranged upon the subject of the fourth dimension.
There are few changes in the old Quarter.
"All the same, sing it, Hilda."
"Isn't London a tomb on Sunday night?"
Hugh MacConnell came with his sister, and stood about, managing his tea cup awkwardly and watching every one out of his deep set, faded eyes.
I gave her a spray of lilac, I remember, and you gave her a franc.
American tours have spoiled them, I'm afraid.
Marie got them all fresh in Covent Garden market yesterday morning."
On other matters he was perfectly rational and he was easy and pleasing in conversation.
Alexander went over and opened the window for her.
When she finished, Alexander shook himself out of a reverie.
I had quite forgotten-I was back there.
He had shut his eyes to give him the courage, he remembered, and she had trembled so-
"I'm glad," said Alexander simply.
Lamb wouldn't care a great deal about many of them, I fancy."
See how white the stars are."
She looked at us with such despair and longing, out from under her black shawl.
But he's given me some good Irish songs.
What kind of a part is it?
"Don't I, though!
Marie opened the door and smilingly announced that dinner was served.
"It was on the Quai we met that woman who was crying so bitterly.
Where did you get those etchings?
Can't I get a scarf or something?"
"Rooms always look better by lamplight-in London, at least.
Do you remember that first walk we took together in Paris?
You must go now, Bartley.
Shall you wear yellow gowns?
What she wanted from us was neither our flowers nor our francs, but just our youth.
"My dining room," Hilda explained, as she led the way, "is the tiniest place you have ever seen."
"I expect it was the last franc I had.
Hans pointed with his finger at a dark mass six hundred yards away, rising and falling alternately with heavy plunges.
The remainder of the sea monsters have disappeared.
I looked at the hunter.
During his watch I slept.
At three hundred yards from us the battle was fought.
The shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves.
"Yet we are going very fast."
Only his long neck shoots up, drops again, coils and uncoils, droops, lashes the waters like a gigantic whip, and writhes like a worm that you tread on.
No; surely it cannot be!
The reptiles rose; they wheeled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express trains.
My uncle took soundings several times.
Look at its vast jaws and its rows of teeth!
"What two?
The horizon seems extremely distant.
And yet, what cause was there for anger?
The struggle continues with unabated ferocity.
No, not at all."
I looked and cried:
It is diving down!"
"Yes," replied my uncle, "and there is a sea lizard of vast size."
But when the pick was shipped again, Hans pointed out on its surface deep prints as if it had been violently compressed between two hard bodies.
They burdened this earth a thousand ages before man appeared, but their fossil remains, found in the argillaceous limestone called by the English the lias, have enabled their colossal structure to be perfectly built up again and anatomically ascertained.
But it now seems to me as if the other animals were taking part in the fray-the porpoise, the whale, the lizard, the tortoise.
I could not take my eyes off this indented iron bar.
But soon the reptile's agony draws to an end; its movements become fainter, its contortions cease to be so violent, and the long serpentine form lies a lifeless log on the labouring deep.
"And the other?"
Did he cross it?
All at once an enormous head is darted up, the head of the plesiosaurus.
The wind freshens.
The water is splashed for a long way around.
Is not the raft spinning along with marvellous speed?
Yes, indeed, those are the marks of teeth imprinted upon the metal! The jaws which they arm must be possessed of amazing strength.
The raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again, at a distance of twenty fathoms.
The world then belonged to reptiles.
"Teeth!" I cried, considering the iron bar with more attention.
"Impatient, then?"
We stood amazed, thunderstruck, at the presence of such a herd of marine monsters.
I prepare to fire.
Its body is entirely covered with a thick armour of scales, and its neck, as flexible as a swan's, rises thirty feet above the waves.
My head is still stupefied with the vivid reality of my dream.
CHAPTER thirty three.
"-You seem anxious, my uncle," I said, seeing him continually with his glass to his eye.
"Surely you must be mistaken," I cried.
We remain motionless, ready to fire.
"One might be, with less reason than now."
No human eye has ever beheld them living.
I was possessed with an apprehension lest the electric light should grow dim, or fail altogether.
They possessed a perfect organisation, gigantic proportions, prodigious strength.
I took up my rifle.
Hans had spoken truly.
The plesiosaurus, a serpent with a cylindrical body and a short tail, has four flappers or paddles to act like oars.
My uncle has had no dreams, but he is out of temper.
I take this as my answer, and I leave the Professor to bite his lips with impatience.
We must be on the look out.
The two beasts are fast locked together; I cannot distinguish the one from the other.
Suddenly the ichthyosaurus and the plesiosaurus disappear below, leaving a whirlpool eddying in the water.
I then remembered that the Professor, before starting, had estimated the length of this underground sea at thirty leagues.
The combatants alternately approach and recede from our raft.
I return to the Icelander.
Weather unchanged.
Two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me.
"What does that signify?
I suppose Professor Liedenbrock was of my opinion too, and even shared my fears, for after having examined the pick, his eyes traversed the ocean from side to side.
Flight was out of the question now.
He examines the horizon all round with his glass, and folds his arms with the air of an injured man.
Several minutes pass by while the fight goes on under water.
"That is just the question.
Therefore don't talk to me about views and prospects."
I came with an object, and I mean to attain it.
They were of supernatural dimensions; the smallest of them would have crunched our raft, crew and all, at one snap of its huge jaws.
"But," I remarked, "since we have followed the road that Saknussemm has shown us-"
I can distinguish the eye of the ichthyosaurus glowing like a red hot coal, and as large as a man's head.
Have we followed that road?
"Have we struck land?"
The danger is approaching.
I am not complaining that the rate is slow, but that the sea is so wide."
"But I don't care for prospects.
We stood dumb with fear.
I saw at the Hamburg museum the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in length.
"At any rate we cannot feel sorry to have come so far.
Yet the deep marks of conical teeth upon the iron pick are certainly those of the crocodile.
I no longer see his scaly armour.
It must be as wide as the Mediterranean or the Atlantic-and why not?
My uncle notices it, and looks on approvingly.
I look at our guns and see that they are all right.
Two monsters only were creating all this commotion; and before my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive world.
"We are not descending as we ought to be," the Professor declares. "We are losing time, and the fact is, I have not come all this way to take a little sail upon a pond on a raft."
What a very bad notion that was of his, I thought to myself, to take soundings just here!
I had rather not disturb him while he is quiet.
Hans was at the helm.
He shakes his head negatively.
"No: the first of those monsters has a porpoise's snout, a lizard's head, a crocodile's teeth; and hence our mistake.
On awaking, my first thought was to observe the intensity of the light.
A BATTLE OF MONSTERS
The spray almost blinds us.
"I can see its great fins.
Suppose that solid roof should crumble down upon our heads!
The sail stretches tight like a bubble ready to burst.
The wind has risen, and has rapidly carried us away from Axel Island.
At noon the violence of the storm redoubles.
The roarings become lost in the distance.
"There's a heavy storm coming on," I cried, pointing towards the horizon.
But before it has reached us the rain cloud parts asunder, the sea boils, and the electric fires are brought into violent action by a mighty chemical power that descends from the higher regions.
Our mouths open, our lips move, but not a word can be heard.
He has laid a firm hold upon a rope, and appears to watch with grim satisfaction this awful display of elemental strife.
In the distance the clouds resemble great bales of cotton, piled up in picturesque disorder.
We have been carried under England, under the channel, under France, perhaps under the whole of Europe.
The atmosphere is charged with vapours, pervaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of saline waters.
Sunday, twenty three.--Where are we?
Is it riveted to the planks?
It rushes on from the farthest recesses of the vast cavern.
Are we still under the sea?
He nods his consent.
He can only spare time to shrug his shoulders viciously.
A suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air, it enters the throat, it fills the lungs.
At ten in the morning the symptoms of storm become aggravated.
The night was fearful; no abatement of the storm.
The heaving waves resemble fiery volcanic hills, each belching forth its own interior flames, and every crest is plumed with dancing fire.
The atmosphere is evidently charged and surcharged with electricity. My whole body is saturated; my hair bristles just as when you stand upon an insulated stool under the action of an electrical machine.
"Those clouds seem as if they were going to crush the sea."
Let the wind catch us if it will!
"Never!
They seem to be 'We are lost'; but I am not sure.
At last I write down the words: "Let us lower the sail."
I could just see my uncle at full length on the raft, and Hans still at his helm and spitting fire under the action of the electricity which has saturated him.
Alas! the fall upon our fated raft of this electric globe has magnetised every iron article on board.
My eyes fail under the dazzling light, my ears are stunned with the incessant crash of thunder.
Driven forward with a swiftness that cannot be measured.
The instruments, the tools, our guns, are clashing and clanking violently in their collisions with each other; the nails of my boots cling tenaciously to a plate of iron let into the timbers, and I cannot draw my foot away from the spot.
AN ELECTRIC STORM
The clouds are sinking lower, and assume an olive hue.
The lightning flashes with intense brilliancy, and never seems to cease for a moment.
I must be bound to the mast, which bows like a reed before the mighty strength of the storm.
Such is their ponderous weight that they cannot rise from the horizon; but, obeying an impulse from higher currents, their dense consistency slowly yields.
Where?
Is the atmospheric condition, having once reached this density, to become final?
I refer to the thermometer; it indicates . . . (the figure is obliterated).
We have made two hundred leagues since we left Axel Island.
The rudder stands motionless in a sluggish, waveless sea.
My uncle has drawn nearer to me.
CHAPTER thirty five.
I have only been able to find a few which I seem to have jotted down almost unconsciously.
But where are we going to?
"The sail! the sail!" I cry, motioning to lower it.
Ah! what a flood of intense and dazzling light! the globe has burst, and we are deluged with tongues of fire!
We suffer stifling pains.
But Hans is as usual. The raft bears on still to the south-east.
We are prostrated and worn out with fatigue.
We lay there, our blood running cold with unspeakable terror.
The darkness deepens; scarcely can I jot down a few hurried notes.
I am loth to believe these atmospheric menaces, and yet I cannot help muttering:
His temper is awful, to judge from the working of his features, as he sees this vast length of ocean unrolling before him to an indefinite extent.
The Professor made no answer.
A fresh noise is heard!
A deep silence falls on all around.
The helm makes a bound.
Each of us is lashed to some part of the raft.
Other flashes with incessant play cross their vivid fires, while others again roll themselves into balls of living fire which explode like bombshells, but the music of which scarcely adds to the din of the battle strife that almost deprives us of our senses of hearing and sight; the limit of intense loudness has been passed within which the human ear can distinguish one sound from another.
We are obliged to secure as fast as possible every article that belongs to our cargo.
The fireball, half of it white, half azure blue, and the size of a ten inch shell, moved slowly about the raft, but revolving on its own axis with astonishing velocity, as if whipped round by the force of the whirlwind.
The heat increases.
His long hair blown by the pelting storm, and laid flat across his immovable countenance, makes him a strange figure; for the end of each lock of loose flowing hair is tipped with little luminous radiations.
I feel peculiar sensations, like many creatures on earth at the approach of violent atmospheric changes.
We cannot even make ourselves heard by approaching our mouth close to the ear.
From the under surface of the clouds there are continual emissions of lurid light; electric matter is in continual evolution from their component molecules; the gaseous elements of the air need to be slaked with moisture; for innumerable columns of water rush upwards into the air and fall back again in white foam.
From time to time a fleecy tuft of mist, with yet some gleaming light left upon it, drops down upon the dense floor of grey, and loses itself in the opaque and impenetrable mass.
Scarcely has he lifted his head again before a ball of fire has bounded over the waves and lighted on board our raft.
My uncle falls full length; I creep close to him.
"No, no! Never!" shouted my impetuous uncle.
Hans stirs not.
And now my turn comes; pale and trembling under the blinding splendour and the melting heat, it drops at my feet, spinning silently round upon the deck; I try to move my foot away, but cannot.
Then all the light disappears.
But their very brevity and their obscurity reveal the intensity of the excitement which dominated me, and describe the actual position even better than my memory could do.)
Mast and sail flew up in an instant together, and I saw them carried up to prodigious height, resembling in appearance a pterodactyle, one of those strong birds of the infant world.
On the mast already I see the light play of a lambent st Elmo's fire; the outstretched sail catches not a breath of wind, and hangs like a sheet of lead.
My uncle lies full length across the raft.
The lately roaring winds are hushed into a dead calm; nature seems to breathe no more, and to be sinking into the stillness of death.
The piled up vapours condense into water; and the air, put into violent action to supply the vacuum left by the condensation of the mists, rouses itself into a whirlwind.
Yes, we are borne at incalculable speed.
The wind never lulls but to acquire increased strength; the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts and rushing storms.
It seems to me as if my companions, the moment they touched me, would receive a severe shock like that from an electric eel.
Our family always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things!
'We won't talk about her any more if you'd rather not.'
'I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, 'I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn!
So she called softly after it, 'Mouse dear!
Good bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). 'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?
How queer everything is to day!
'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, 'a great girl like you,' (she might well say this), 'to go on crying in this way!
The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. 'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings.
'Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, 'to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out of the way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.' So she began: 'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool?
'As if I would talk on such a subject!
I almost think I can remember feeling a little different.
'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angry about it.
Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'
And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in the night?
It'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look up and say "Who am I then?
'We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail.
That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to day.'
And how odd the directions will look!
Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning?
I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome-no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain!
'Would YOU like cats if you were me?'
'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh!
I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'
The Pool of Tears
No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here!
Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'
And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.
CHAPTER two.
Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.
'How CAN I have done that?' she thought.
A little bright eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair!
'Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice.
Don't let me hear the name again!'
Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is-oh dear!
I must have been changed for Mabel!
I'll try if I know all the things I used to know.
As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she was talking.
'Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); 'now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was!
Poor Alice!
"Yes, give me the orgeat."
My new friend was a poet as I was; he was an admirer of Italian literature, while I admired the French.
The 'badauds', who never fail to congregate near the carriage of princes, no matter if they have seen them a hundred times, or if they know them to be as ugly as monkeys, repeated the words of the duchess everywhere, and that was enough to send here all the snuff takers of the capital in a hurry.
Martelli composed a satire against Maffei, in which he designated him by the anagram of Femia.
I have the best Italian poets.
I shall call you Esprit."
"Without milk!
"I have it, sir."
"You are mad, she has given birth to a princess."
I laugh heartily.
Well, sir, we never make coffee but in the afternoon. Would you like a good bavaroise, or a decanter of orgeat?"
"Excellent, I made it myself yesterday."
"Here, go and get me change for a Louis."
My remark pleases him, but I soon prove to him that it is not the right way to speak, however perfect may have been the language of that ancient writer.
I address him in Italian, and he answers very wittily, but his way of speaking makes me smile, and I tell him why.
Baletti's father, who had just recovered from a long illness, was not with us, but we had his father's sister, who was older than Mario.
"Quite the reverse, for it was a cunning artifice on her part.
"The milk is very good."
After his visit I told Esprit to take me to the Palais Royal, and I left him at the gates.
But, sir, how shall I find a teacher?
In order to please her, I spoke to her of the Abbe Conti, and I had occasion to quote two lines of that profound writer.
Therefore it is not a paradox to say that the French would be wiser if they were less witty.
"Milk!
"Well!
She held her tongue, but from that time she told everybody that I was an impostor.
I never drink any.
I thanked him, but I was not deceived by his compliment.
Make me a cup of fresh coffee without milk."
The expression of Crebillon's face was that of the lion's or of the cat's, which is the same thing.
"You may be quite sure it's there," said Captain Battleax, "and that I can so use it as to half obliterate your town within two minutes of my return on board."
"You will perceive, Captain Battleax, that there is a little difference of opinion between us all here as to the ceremony which was to have been accomplished this morning.
"Their masters," said Mrs Neverbend.
No doubt, in process of time the ladies will follow-"
"I did not mean," said Captain Battleax, "to touch upon public subjects at such a moment as this.
And yet that something must be playful in its nature.
Jack had been standing in the far corner of the room talking to Eva, and was now reduced to silence by his praises.
But how can a little State, but a few years old, situated on a small island, far removed from all the centres of civilisation, contend on any point with the owner of the great two hundred fifty-ton swiveller gun?"
"It is simply a contest between brute strength and mental energy."
The john Bright is armed with a weapon of great power, against which it is impossible that the people of Britannula should prevail.
After that there was no attempt at speaking.
We had received details of the whole affair by water telegram before the john Bright started.
"But what is the delicate mission?" I asked.
We sat with the officers some little time after dinner, and then went ashore.
I simply bowed to him.
Now in spite of what the captain said, I undoubtedly had intended to make a speech.
Lieutenant Crosstrees is a very gallant officer.
Now, at the close of the twentieth century, could oppression be carried to such a height as this?
Alas!
I was to be taken away and carried to England or elsewhere,--or drowned upon the voyage, it mattered not which.
Mrs Neverbend should come with me, or stay, if it so pleased her, in Gladstonopolis.
Of what Mrs Neverbend had gone through in providing birds, beasts, and fishes, not to talk of tarts and jellies, for the dinner of that day, no one but myself can have any idea; but it must be admitted that she accomplished her task with thorough success.
On myself, I need hardly say that it would be inoperative.
Government that he shall be treated with all respect, and that those honours shall be paid to him which are due to the President of a friendly republic.
I remained there alone for many hours, but I must acknowledge that before I left the chambers I had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light.
There was Captain Battleax seated there, beautiful with a cocked hat, and an epaulet, and gold braid.
This was the first complimentary speech which Sir Ferdinando had made, and I must confess that it was efficacious.
But you must be aware that it has been our intention to interfere with that which you must regard as the performance of a duty."
The country has since undoubtedly prospered, and in a material point of view has given us no grounds for regret.
It is therefore desired that you should endeavour to obtain information as to his intentions; and that, if the Fixed Period be not abandoned altogether, with a clear conviction as to its cruelty on the part of the inhabitants generally, you should cause him to be carried away and brought to England.
"What world-wide iniquity such a speech as that discloses!" said I, still turning myself to the captain; for though I would have crushed them both by my words had it been possible, my dislike centred itself on Sir Ferdinando.
But I blushed for its untruth.
And what hope had there been, what reasonable expectation, that the system should have been allowed fair play?
Minister of the day thought it expedient to grant their request.
In the meantime, my friend Captain Battleax has below a guard of fifty marines, who will pay you the respect of escorting you on board with two of the ship's cutters.
In regard to Mr Neverbend himself, it is the especial wish of h m
He was dressed in simple black, and was clearly not one of the ship's officers; but I could not but suspect at the moment that he was in some special measure concerned in the mission on which the gunboat had been sent. He sat on Mrs Neverbend's left hand, and did seem in some respect to be the chief man on that occasion.
"And that in opposition to the wishes, as I understand, of a large proportion of your fellow citizens?"
"No doubt,--knowing nothing of the forms of our government, or-"
How much of evil,--of real accomplished evil,--had there not occurred to me during the last few days!
"We are quite satisfied now, Captain Battleax," said my wife.
"That having all been pleasantly settled," said Sir Ferdinando, with a smile, "I will ask you to read the document by which this duty has been placed in my hands." He then took out of his pocket a letter addressed to him by the Duke of Hatfield, as Minister for the Crown Colonies, and gave it to me to read.
"If so, you must be content to take my dead body.
CHAPTER nine.
"We have already lighted our fires, and our sailors are weighing the anchors.
Had Eva Crasweller not been good looking, had Jack been still at college, had Sir Kennington Oval remained in England, had Mr Bunnit and the bar keeper not succeeded in stopping my carriage on the hill,--should I have succeeded in arranging for the final departure of my old friend?
Therefore we can be courteous while we submit.
This was a pretty little speech enough, and received the eager compliments of the officers of the john Bright.
I thought for a little what answer it would best become me to give to this question, but I paused only for a moment or two.
At any rate, my eloquence was altogether stopped. The gentleman was named Sir Ferdinando Brown.
All this I could hardly explain to him, as I should thus be giving to him the strongest evidence against my own philosophy.
When this captain should have taken himself and his vessel back to England, I would retire to a small farm which I possessed at the farthest side of the island, and there in seclusion would I end my days.
And even had I succeeded in carrying my success so far as that, should I not have appeared a murderer to my fellow citizens had not his departure been followed in regular sequence by that of all others till it had come to my turn? Had Crasweller departed, and had the system then been stopped, should I not have appeared a murderer even to myself?
Then there were three or four leading men of the community, with their wives, who were for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies.
"And now," he continued, "will you answer me one question?"
With this the two gentlemen left the room.
"Your promised bride seems to have it all her own way," said Captain Battleax to Jack, when at last the ladies had withdrawn.
I wept to think that a spirit of honesty should as yet have prevailed so little in the world.
"Lieutenant Crosstrees has sealed orders, and is practically acquainted with the mechanism of the gun.
"If you will look at the contests throughout the world," said Sir Ferdinando, "you will generally find that the highest respect is paid to the greatest battalions."
It is quite impossible.
And immediately on his sitting down, there got up a gentleman to whom I had not been introduced before this day, and gave the health of Mrs Neverbend and the ladies of Britannula.
"I am sure we are all delighted to hear the ladies speak in so pleasant a manner," said First Lieutenant Crosstrees, an officer with whom I have since become particularly intimate.
Will twelve o'clock suit you?"
I must by no means show in such company as was now present the strong feeling which pervaded my own mind.
This, I felt, was paid to me as being President of the republic, and I endeavoured to behave myself with such mingled humility and dignity as might befit the occasion; but I could not but feel that something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordinary life.
"It is a duty," said i "But your power is so superior to any that I can advance, as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace in yielding to it.
At the present moment a law has been passed which, if carried into action, would become abhorrent to mankind at large.
"That is all quite true, Mr Neverbend," said Sir Ferdinando Brown.
But, on the whole, we are a prosperous and well satisfied people."
And this plan was adopted, too, in order to extract from me a promise that I would depart in peace. At any rate, I did make the promise, and gave these two gentlemen my word that I would be present there in my own room in the executive chambers at the same hour on the day but one following.
"Mr President," said he, "I am in command of her Majesty's gunboat, the john Bright, and I have come to pay my respects to the ladies."
And I, looking at the matter from my own point of view, was a husband, the head of a family, a man largely concerned in business,--I was to be carried away in bondage-I, who had done no wrong, had disobeyed no law, who had indeed been conspicuous for my adherence to my duties!
"What would become of your gun were I to kidnap you?"
When the President of the republic has his health drunk, it is, I conceive, his duty to do so.
To enable you to effect this, Captain Battleax, of h m gunboat the john Bright, has been instructed to carry you out.
"To day!" I shouted.
"And you are, I am aware, sufficiently popular with the people here to enable you to do so?"
Though you should reduce me to atoms, from them would spring those opinions which would serve altogether to silence your artillery.
He was quiet, and I might almost say silent, during the whole evening; but I could see from the testimony of his altered countenance how strong is the passion for life that dwells in the human breast.
A presentiment indeed!
"I have come to your shores, Mr President, with the purpose of seeing how things are progressing in this distant quarter of the world."
Jack would become Eva's happy husband, and would remain amidst the hurried duties of the eager world. Crasweller, the triumphant, would live, and at last die, amidst the flocks and herds of Little Christchurch.
Then we began to think of the hospitality of the island, and the officers of the john Bright were asked to dine with us on the following day.
"They, of course, must all be altered."
Every hope for which I had lived, as I then told myself, had been brought to sudden extinction by the coming of these men to whom I had been so pleasant, and who, in their turn, had been so pleasant to me!
Captain Battleax, of the john Bright, will have received a letter to the same effect from the First Lord of the Admiralty, and you will find him ready to co-operate with your Excellency in every respect.--I have the honour to be, sir, your Excellency's most obedient servant,
It seemed to me as he entered the room and took the chair that was offered to him, that he was the greater man of the two on the occasion,--or perhaps I should say of the three. And yet he had not before come on shore to visit me, nor had he made one at our little dinner party.
Then there was a little pause in the conversation, and I felt myself bound to say something as to the violent interruption to which I had this morning been subjected.
I am here only to pay my respects as a messenger from Great Britain to Britannula, to congratulate you all on your late victory at cricket, and to say how loud are the praises bestowed on Mr john Neverbend, junior, for his skill and gallantry.
"Half past ten," said the captain, looking at his watch.
"Things were progressing, Captain Battleax, pretty well before this morning.
"It is always well to be on the safe side."
This I read with great attention, while they sat silent.
Had the telegraph been invented in the days of ancient Rome, would the romans have accepted it, or have stoned Wheatstone? So thinking, I resolved that I was before my age, and that I must pay the allotted penalty.
However, he proposed Mrs Neverbend's health and the ladies, and the captain instantly called upon the band to play some favourite tune.
"Very well put," said Sir Ferdinando.
Therefore, I feel myself quite able, as President of this republic, to receive you with a courtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally."
It seemed as though I were treated with almost royal honour.
"Quite satisfied," said Eva.
I did once or twice during the festivity glance round at old Crasweller.
The Crooked Magician
"I would like to do that."
The Magician is very busy, as I said, but if you will promise not to disturb him you may come into his workshop and watch him prepare a wonderful charm."
A Patchwork Girl?
At the foot of the mountain that separated the Country of the Munchkins from the Country of the Gillikins, the path divided.
"Yes; it is perfection," she declared.
"It is, good Dame Margolotte."
There was a savory stew, smoking hot, a dish of blue peas, a bowl of sweet milk of a delicate blue tint and a blue pudding with blue plums in it.
Ojo dressed.
"Perhaps the Powder of Life couldn't either," said Ojo.
Instead of shoes, the old man wore boots with turnover tops and his blue coat had wide cuffs of gold braid.
But in other parts of Oz the people favor different colors.
"But tell me, please, what you intend to do with this new lot of the Powder of Life, which dr Pipt is making.
"I want it to bring my Patchwork Girl to life."
And in the Munchkin Country?" she exclaimed.
"I do not know how, but you must keep the matter in mind and perhaps the chance will come to you," she replied.
The woman seemed thoughtful.
"How can I lose that 'Un,' Dame Margolotte?"
"I think I must show you my Patchwork Girl," said Margolotte, laughing at the boy's astonishment, "for she is rather difficult to explain.
"Then it must be somewhere in the Blue Forest."
I will show you what a good job I did," and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors.
"I never knew I was called the Unlucky," said Ojo, soberly; "but it is really a good name for me."
"Yes, for a Munchkin.
He said his wife wanted it for some especial purpose."
"What is a patchwork quilt?" asked Ojo.
Then they started on again and two hours later came in sight of the house of dr Pipt.
For a long time he had wished to explore the beautiful Land of Oz in which they lived.
"We are traveling," replied Ojo, "and we stopped at your house just to rest and refresh ourselves.
One way led to the left and the other to the right-straight up the mountain.
What is that?" Ojo asked, for this seemed even more strange and unusual than a Glass Cat.
"Is blue the only respectable color, then?" inquired Ojo.
"Oh!
"We have come from a far lonelier place than this."
"Ah," said Ojo; "you must be Dame Margolotte, the good wife of dr Pipt."
"A lonelier place!
"Do you wish to see dr Pipt on business or for pleasure?"
All our country is blue, you know.
Ojo was hungry, though; so he divided the piece of bread upon the table and ate his half for breakfast, washing it down with fresh, cool water from the brook.
Ojo was well pleased.
"Thank you," replied the boy, much pleased.
"What did old Mombi the Witch do with the Powder of Life your husband gave her?" asked the boy.
"And you must be Ojo the Unlucky," she added.
"The more one knows, the luckier he is, for knowledge is the greatest gift in life."
"A Glass Cat!" exclaimed Ojo, astonished.
"She brought Jack Pumpkinhead to life, for one thing," was the reply. "I suppose you've heard of Jack Pumpkinhead.
"Has she any brains?" asked Ojo.
"Well, that may be true," agreed Margolotte; "but, on the contrary, a servant with too much brains is sure to become independent and high and mighty and feel above her work.
"A little 'Cleverness'?
"Little," said he.
But the Magician replied:
"What does the Liquid of Petrifaction do?" inquired the boy.
I want her to know just enough, but not too much."
But just then there came a scratching at the back door and a shrill voice cried:
"He means," explained Ojo, "that unless your servant has good brains she won't know how to obey you properly, nor do the things you ask her to do."
Margolotte had first made the girl's form from the patchwork quilt and then she had dressed it with a patchwork skirt and an apron with pockets in it-using the same gay material throughout.
Come and help me."
"Ingenuity," "Amiability,"
The Patchwork Girl was taller than he, when she stood upright, and her body was plump and rounded because it had been so neatly stuffed with cotton.
"Most people talk too much, so it is a relief to find one who talks too little."
Chapter Three
"Ask like a good cat, then," she said.
"Yes; that's proper cat talk," declared the woman, and opened the door.
"I am not allowed to perform magic, except for my own amusement," he told his visitors, as he lighted a pipe with a crooked stem and began to smoke.
"Magic must be a very interesting study," said Ojo.
"Don't you find it very annoying to be so crooked?" he asked.
"This powder must not be used before to morrow morning; but I think it is now cool enough to be bottled."
All the fingers and thumbs of the girl's hands had been carefully formed and stuffed and stitched at the edges, with gold plates at the ends to serve as finger nails.
When the mixture was complete there was scarcely a handful, all told.
"No; I am quite proud of my person," was the reply.
Very carefully he placed the Powder of Life in the gold bottle and then locked it up in a drawer of his cabinet.
"She will have to work, when she comes to life," said Margolotte.
"I know; but that renders your uncle a most agreeable companion and gossip," declared dr Pipt.
If I get tired looking at her patched face I can whitewash it."
The head of the Patchwork Girl was the most curious part of her.
"It truly is," asserted the Magician.
It will never break nor wear out."
"No; I am sure I am right about that," returned the woman.
"Quick, Margolotte!
No one saw him do this, for all were looking at the Powder of Life; but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing, and came back to the cupboard.
"Learning," "Truth,"
What one useful thing could I do for a living, for the support of mother and the children?
She was tired of other things.
But that wise and placid woman understood the sweet rebel a great deal better than ruth understood herself.
ruth sat quite still for a time, with face intent and flushed.
"I should think so, you innocent puss, and in an old one too.
It is a city of steady thrift, the arms of which might well be the deliberate but delicious terrapin that imparts such a royal flavor to its feasts.
That evening ruth and her father sat late by the drawing room fire, as they were quite apt to do at night.
"How far?"
Any departure from either color or shape would be instantly taken note of.
I know I can go through the whole, clinics, dissecting room and all.
The rather common place and unformed hand writing seemed to him peculiar and characteristic, different from that of any other woman.
ruth turned square round to her mother, and with an impassive face and not the slightest change of tone, said,
"Well, mother," said the young student, looking up, with a shade of impatience.
"Mother; thee knows I couldn't stand it at Westfield; the school stifled me, it's a place to turn young people into dried fruit."
But he only said,
Friend Eli, who had long ago laid aside the Quaker dress, and was out of Meeting, and who in fact after a youth of doubt could not yet define his belief, nevertheless looked with some wonder at this fierce young eagle of his, hatched in a Friend's dove cote.
Is he going to start a daily newspaper among the Kick a poos?"
"Thy ways greatly try me, ruth, and all thy relations.
Was she thinking about Philip, as she gazed across the fresh lawn over the tree tops to the Chelton Hills, or of that world which his entrance, into her tradition bound life had been one of the means of opening to her?
She had begun her open battle.
"I have nothing to wear," replied that demure person.
And, besides, suppose thee does learn medicine?"
No, I don't feel at home there."
Philip has gone to the far west."
"I hope at least, ruth, thee will let us know when thee opens an office," said her mother, with an approach to sarcasm that she rarely indulged in, as she rose and left the room.
"I know," said Margaret Bolton, with a half anxious smile, "thee chafes against all the ways of Friends, but what will thee do?
This excellent advice did not seem to impress ruth greatly, for she was looking away with that abstraction of vision which often came into her grey eyes, and at length she exclaimed, with a sort of impatience,
The letter that Philip Sterling wrote to ruth Bolton, on the evening of setting out to seek his fortune in the west, found that young lady in her own father's house in Philadelphia.
If I go to Meeting at all I like best to sit in the quiet old house in Germantown, where the windows are all open and I can see the trees, and hear the stir of the leaves. It's such a crush at the Yearly Meeting at Arch Street, and then there's the row of sleek looking young men who line the curbstone and stare at us as we come out.
She tried this morning an air or two upon the piano, sang a simple song in a sweet but slightly metallic voice, and then seating herself by the open window, read Philip's letter.
"Has thee consulted thy mother about a career, I suppose it is a career thee wants?"
"Is thee going to the Yearly Meeting, ruth?" asked one of the girls.
It was one of the pleasantest of the many charming suburban houses in that hospitable city, which is territorially one of the largest cities in the world, and only prevented from becoming the convenient metropolis of the country by the intrusive strip of Camden and Amboy sand which shuts it off from the Atlantic ocean.
"Thee has another letter from young Sterling," said Eli Bolton.
"I will practice it."
CHAPTER fourteen.
"What's the good, father, of a series of human beings who don't advance any?"
"If thee wants to see new bonnets, orthodox to a shade and conformed to the letter of the true form, thee must go to the Arch Street Meeting.
"I want to be something, to make myself something, to do something.
ruth asked the enthusiasts if they would like to live in such a sounding mausoleum, with its great halls and echoing rooms, and no comfortable place in it for the accommodation of any body?
The truth is that the country cousins had come to town to attend the Yearly Meeting, and the amount of shopping that preceded that religious event was scarcely exceeded by the preparations for the opera in more worldly circles.
It was a spring morning, and perhaps it was the influence of it that made ruth a little restless, satisfied neither with the out doors nor the in doors.
Think of the stone shingles of the roof eight inches thick!
"Why should I? I've been again and again.
A slight frail girl like thee, study medicine! Does thee think thee could stand it six months?
"I hope thee told the elders that father and I are responsible for the piano, and that, much as thee loves music, thee is never in the room when it is played.
And then there was Broad street!
"If I can get patients."
Whatever she thought, she was not idly musing, as one might see by the expression of her face.
"Somewhat that depends upon whether her children amount to anything," retorted the sharp little disputant.
He's going into business."
Philip liked the letter, as he did everything she did; but he had a dim notion that there was more about herself in the letter than about him.
And the lectures, and the dissecting rooms, has thee thought of the dissecting rooms?"
She also had a history, possibly, and had sometime beaten her young wings against the cage of custom, and indulged in dreams of a new social order, and had passed through that fiery period when it seems possible for one mind, which has not yet tried its limits, to break up and re arrange the world.
Does thee think I lack nerve?
It was time for him to do something.
"And thee won't go?"
But ruth confessed that she was tired of them, and also of the Mint.
"But thy health and strength, child; thee can never stand the severe application.
If they were orphans, would they like to be brought up in a Grecian temple?
He took it with him from the Southern Hotel, when he went to walk, and read it over and again in an unfrequented street as he stumbled along.
"I wanted to talk with thee a little about thy plans."
It was out now.
"If I must say it, mother, I want to go away, and get out of this dead level."
Father, I should like to break things and get loose!"
"I have not asked him," ruth replied with a look that might imply that she was one of those determined little bodies who first made up her own mind and then compelled others to make up theirs in accordance with hers.
And if I had a fortune, would thee want me to lead a useless life?"
"He doesn't say, but it's on the frontier, and on the map everything beyond it is marked 'Indians' and 'desert,' and looks as desolate as a Wednesday Meeting."
Her sisters had gone to the city to show some country visitors Independence Hall, Girard College and Fairmount Water Works and Park, four objects which Americans cannot die peacefully, even in Naples, without having seen.
"Mother," said ruth calmly, "I have thought it all over.
"Where thee and thy family are known?"
Fortunately father is already out of meeting, so they can't discipline him.
"Yes.
Margaret Bolton almost lost for a moment her habitual placidity.
"ruth?"
"Has thy mother led a useless life?"
Wasn't it the broadest and the longest street in the world?
What a sweet voiced little innocent, it was to be sure.
"What sort of business can a young man go into without capital?"
ruth did not reply directly; she complained that her mother didn't understand her.
The sight seers returned in high spirits from the city.
Why should I rust, and be stupid, and sit in inaction because I am a girl? What would happen to me if thee should lose thy property and die?
ruth was glad to hear that Philip had made a push into the world, and she was sure that his talent and courage would make a way for him. She should pray for his success at any rate, and especially that the Indians, in saint Louis, would not take his scalp.
Why is thee so discontented?"
I heard father tell cousin Abner that he was whipped so often for whistling when he was a boy that he was determined to have what compensation he could get now."
After a time she took up a book; it was a medical work, and to all appearance about as interesting to a girl of eighteen as the statutes at large; but her face was soon aglow over its pages, and she was so absorbed in it that she did not notice the entrance of her mother at the open door.
What is there to fear in a person dead more than in a person living?"
He well knew the perils of the frontier, the savage state of society, the lurking Indians and the dangers of fever.
"But in what capacity would I go?"
Happy youth, that is ready to pack its valise, and start for Cathay on an hour's notice.
The fact was, though Philip Sterling did not know it, that he wanted several other things quite as much as he wanted wealth.
He would say good night, but not good bye.
He is embarrassed which to choose, and is not unlikely to waste years in dallying with his chances, before giving himself to the serious tug and strain of a single object.
He never was so summoned, but none of his acquaintances would have been surprised to hear any day that he had gone to Panama or Peoria, or to hear from him that he had bought the Bank of Commerce.
He had brown hair, hazel eyes set wide apart, a broad but not high forehead, and a fresh winning face.
"Why, it's in Missouri somewhere, on the frontier I think.
If he returned with a fortune, perhaps and perhaps.
"Well, why don't you go into something?
"Field engineer, civil engineer.
To his uncle he said that he had made an arrangement with some New York capitalists to go to Missouri, in a land and railroad operation, which would at least give him a knowledge of the world and not unlikely offer him a business opening.
It was settled therefore, in the prompt way in which things are settled in New York, that they would start with the rest of the company next morning for the west.
"No, its not too soon.
He has no traditions to bind him or guide him, and his impulse is to break away from the occupation his father has followed, and make a new way for himself.
It was in this time of rather impatient waiting that Philip was one morning walking down Broadway with Henry Brierly.
"Yes, but what is it for, what is it all about?"
That party is going to succeed, it's going to elect the next president."
He had no friend wise enough to tell him to step into the Dorking Convention, then in session, make a sketch of the men and women on the platform, and take it to the editor of the Daily Grapevine, and see what he could get a line for it.
If they disapprove, thought he, I've done my duty by letting them know.
Philip had a good appetite, a sunny temper, and a clear hearty laugh.
No time or distance, however, would ever lessen his interest in her.
"Why don't you see?
It's easy enough.
We wouldn't engineer long."
He frequently accompanied Henry part way down town to what the latter called his office in Broad Street, to which he went, or pretended to go, with regularity every day.
It seemed to him that the newspaper managers didn't want genius, but mere plodding and grubbing.
But Philip did afford it, and he wrote, thanking his friends, and declining because he said the political scheme would fail, and ought to fail.
But there was no real danger to a person who took care of himself.
We'll get a map."
I was afraid it was nearer home."
Might he write to her often and, tell her of his life.
He would make his mark in literature.
Besides Philip hated the copying of pleadings, and he was certain that a life of "whereases" and "aforesaids" and whipping the devil round the stump, would be intolerable.
"It seems to be easier than it is, I begin to think," replied Philip.
"When do you go?" was Philip's next question, after some moments of silence.
If he were good enough he would attach himself to that company of young men in the Theological Seminary, who were seeing New York life in preparation for the ministry.
CHAPTER twelve.
The two were intimate at that time,--they had been classmates-and saw a great deal of each other.
To the young American, here or elsewhere, the paths to fortune are innumerable and all open; there is invitation in the air and success in all his wide horizon.
If he was unsuccessful, or if he never returned-perhaps it would be as well.
Indeed, they lived together in Ninth Street, in a boarding house, there, which had the honor of lodging and partially feeding several other young fellows of like kidney, who have since gone their several ways into fame or into obscurity.
Delightful illusion of paint and tinsel and silk attire, of cheap sentiment and high and mighty dialogue!
"I think I should like it of all things," replied Philip, with some hesitation, "but what for."
His pen therefore, and whereas, and not as aforesaid, strayed off into other scribbling.
"Never mind the map.
Philip never was fortunate enough to hear what would become of a man who should lay his hand on a woman with the exception named; but he learned afterwards that the woman who lays her hand on a man, without any exception whatsoever, is always acquitted by the jury.
We will find the place itself.
You'll never dig it out of the Astor Library."
"Well, make it that.
Philip Sterling used to say that if he should seriously set himself for ten years to any one of the dozen projects that were in his brain, he felt that he could be a rich man.
"Well, I'm going as an engineer.
In an unfortunate hour, he had two or three papers accepted by first-class magazines, at three dollars the printed page, and, behold, his vocation was open to him.
And he went back to his books and to his waiting for an opening large enough for his dignified entrance into the literary world.
He wouldn't bother her with business details, but he hoped that the day was not far off when she would see him return, with a moderate fortune, and something to add to the comfort of her advancing years.
"Oh, it's easy enough to make a fortune," Henry said.
"Oh, it's a big operation.
Philip therefore read diligently in the Astor library, planned literary works that should compel attention, and nursed his genius.
The night was spent in packing up and writing letters, for Philip would not take such an important step without informing his friends.
"Take it of course," says Gringo, "take anything that offers, why not?"
"But they want me to make it an opposition paper."
You can begin by carrying a rod, and putting down the figures.
He wanted to be rich, he had a sincere desire for a fortune, but for some unaccountable reason he hesitated about addressing himself to the narrow work of getting it.
Philip wrote a long letter, first of all, to his mother, full of love and glowing anticipations of his new opening.
On the way up town these adventurers bought books on engineering, and suits of India rubber, which they supposed they would need in a new and probably damp country, and many other things which nobody ever needed anywhere.
He might never see her again; he went to seek his fortune.
"O, very well," said Gringo, turning away with a shade of contempt, "you'll find if you are going into literature and newspaper work that you can't afford a conscience like that."
We are going, a lot of us, railroad men, engineers, contractors.
It was to ruth Bolton that Philip wrote last.
"To morrow.
You know my uncle is a great railroad man.
He knew his uncle would be glad to hear that he had at last turned his thoughts to a practical matter.
"I don't know an engine from a coal cart."
Will there not always be rosin enough for the squeaking fiddle bow?
He wanted to begin at the top of the ladder.
The other teachers were indistinct personalities, always very busy and very tired, and talking "school room" with their meals.
But it's prettiest when the bolls come and swell and burst, and the cotton covers the field like foam, all misty-"
"Goobers," answered the smaller boy.
She started thinking of cotton-but at once she pulled herself back to the other aspect.
But from the offer that came to teach Negroes-country Negroes, and little ones at that-she shrank, and, indeed, probably would have refused it out of hand had it not been for her queer brother, john.
Bles was now laughing outright.
He harkened.
And so, howsoever reluctantly, she had gone.
"Peanuts," Bles specified.
"You ought to know, john, if I teach Negroes I'll scarcely see much of people in my own class."
"Been looking up Tooms County.
"Of course, it isn't-I don't know anything about farming.
Not that she objected to Negroes as human beings-quite the contrary.
Miss Mary Taylor did not take a college course for the purpose of teaching Negroes.
So for the hundredth time she was thinking today, as she walked alone up the lane back of the barn, and then slowly down through the bottoms.
I suppose, though, it's too early for them."
Miss Smith represented the older New England of her parents-honest, inscrutable, determined, with a conscience which she worshipped, and utterly unselfish.
"But, john, there's no society-just elementary work-"
But what did I say so funny?"
He grasped his hoe and started briskly to work.
She began to realize that in this pleasant little chat the fact of the boy's color had quite escaped her; and what especially puzzled her was that this had not happened before.
"Goobers?" uncomprehendingly.
She reddened, drew herself up, and then, dropping her primness, rippled with laughter.
But here in Alabama, brought closely and intimately in touch with these dark skinned children, their color struck her at first with a sort of terror-it seemed ominous and forbidding.
She had pictured herself earning this by teaching one or two of her "specialties" in some private school near New York or Boston, or even in a Western college.
Give 'em your Greek-and study Cotton.
"The Golden Fleece-it's the Silver Fleece!"
"Might learn something useful down there."
At any rate, I say go."
The poetry of the thing began to sing within her, awakening her unpoetic imagination, and she murmured:
"Is that so?"
She wanted a glance of the new books and periodicals and talk of great philanthropies and reforms.
She paused.
His eyes lighted, for cotton was to him a very real and beautiful thing, and a life-long companion, yet not one whose friendship had been coarsened and killed by heavy toil.
"No, ma'am," he said eagerly; then glancing up toward the Cresswell fields, he saw two white men watching them.
Nevertheless, when the end of the summer came and the only opening facing her was the teaching of children at Miss Smith's experiment in the Alabama swamps, it must be frankly confessed that Miss Taylor was disappointed.
"What's the mere color of a human soul's skin," she had cried to a Wellesley audience and the audience had applauded with enthusiasm.
She glanced absently at the boys.
The glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered and murmured before her, stretching away to the Northward. She remembered that beyond this little world it stretched on and on-how far she did not know-but on and on in a great trembling sea, and the foam of its mighty waters would one time flood the ends of the earth.
"Cotton is a wonderful thing, is it not, boys?" she said rather primly. The boys touched their hats and murmured something indistinctly.
Some others, too; big cotton county."
"Nonsense!
He looked at her with twinkling eyes.
Miss Taylor did not know much about cotton, but at least one more remark seemed called for.
The South she had not thought of seriously; and yet, knowing of its delightful hospitality and mild climate, she was not averse to Charleston or New Orleans.
Always before she had been veiled from these folk: who had put the veil there?
The longer she thought, the more bewildered she grew.
I declare!
She appealed to Miss Taylor's ruddier and daintier vision but dimly and distantly as some memory of the past.
And Bles-was Miss Taylor deceived?--or was he chuckling?
Then her New England conscience stepped in.
Then came the explosion.
"What is planted over there?" she asked, although she really didn't care.
Miss Taylor was soon starving for human companionship, for the lighter touches of life and some of its warmth and laughter.
She groped for new ways to teach colored brains and marshal colored thoughts and the result was puzzling both to teacher and student.
She felt out of the world, shut in and mentally anaemic; great as the "Negro Problem" might be as a world problem, it looked sordid and small at close range.
The word was often on Miss Taylor's lips, and she recognized it.
Show off.
"Oh!" murmured Miss Taylor.
He gazed about, perplexed, astonished.
She stood on the island, ethereal, splendid, like some tall, dark, and gorgeous flower of the storied East.
"Miss Smith-!" he gasped, and then-darkness.
Here lay the reading of the riddle: with infinite work and pain, some one had dug a canal from the lagoon to the creek, into which the former had drained by a long and crooked way, thus allowing it to empty directly.
He heard that she was down stairs and ran to meet her with beating heart.
So the world was happy, and the face of the black belt green and luxuriant with thickening flecks of the coming foam of the cotton.
The rain drops were still dripping and gleaming from the trees, flashing back the heavy yellow sunlight.
After some days they let her sit by the window, and she saw Bles pass, but drew back timidly when he looked; and he saw only the flutter of her gown, and waved.
The dark mystery of the Swamp swept over her; the place was hers.
Child?
The Silver Fleece, how was it?
The hope and dream of harvest was upon the land.
What a field of cotton! what a marvellous field!
Bles did not know yet that she was down; but soon he would come searching, for he came each hour, and she pressed her little hands against her breast to still the beating of her heart and the bursting wonder of her love.
Where was the use of imagining?
Then suddenly a panic seized her.
The earth staggered beneath him as he stumbled on; the mud splashed and sunlight glistened; he saw long snakes slithering across his path and fear struck beasts fleeing before his coming.
Up in the sick room Zora lay on the little white bed.
The swamp, the eternal swamp, had been drained in its deepest fastness; but, how?--how?
He skirted the island slowly, stopping near Zora's oak.
A great white foam was spread upon its brown and green; the whole field was waving and shivering in the sunlight.
Yet it was far, and he feared, and ran with startled eyes.
The Sun, the Swamp? Then finding all well, she closed her eyes and slept.
There she lay-wet, bedraggled, motionless, gray pallid beneath her dark drawn skin, her burning eyes searching restlessly for some lost thing, her lips a moaning.
He came down to her slowly, with fixed, hungry eyes, threading his way amid the Fleece.
Bles rushed to the edge of the swamp and stood there irresolute.
Perhaps she, too, might be there, waiting, weeping.
He splashed and stamped along, farther and farther onward until he neared the rampart of the clearing, and put foot upon the tree bridge.
He hurried forth sadly.
She did not move, but lifted both her dark hands, white with cotton; and then, as he came, casting it suddenly to the winds, in tears and laughter she swayed and dropped quivering in his arms.
He started at the thought.
Then he looked down.
The cotton crop was short and poor because of the great rain; but the sun had saved the best, and the price had soared.
To her all things meant something-nothing was aimless, nothing merely happened.
The chair was empty; but he knew.
The net and web of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her; she had struggled in dumb, speechless terror against some mighty grasping that strove for her life, with gnarled and creeping fingers; but now at last, weakly, she opened her eyes and questioned.
Perhaps-if the water had but drained from the cotton!--it was so strong and tall! But, p shaw!
The lagoon was dry.
A great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place, and beneath lay a mighty mass of olive green, thick, tall, wet, and willowy.
"Positively heroic," added Cresswell, avoiding his sister's eyes.
They all glanced at Miss Cresswell, who lay softly back in her chair like a white lily, gleaming and bejewelled, her pale face flushing under the scrutiny; mrs Grey was horrified.
"What did you disagree about?" she asked bluntly.
The door opened softly.
It was a most agreeable couple of hours; all save perhaps mr Smith unbent, the Englishman especially, and the Vanderpools were most gracious; but if the general pleasure was owing to any one person particularly it was to mr Harry Cresswell.
mr Cresswell inclined his head courteously.
She was not herself a notably intelligent woman; she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence in others.
mrs Grey's chef was high priced and efficient, and her butler was the envy of many; consequently, she knew the dinner would be good.
Very soon after dinner Charles Smith excused himself.
The price he had paid was high: he was to represent the interests of the new trust and sundry favorable measures were already drafted and reposing in the safe of the combine's legal department.
There was young Cresswell.
"But, mr Cresswell, you surely believe in schools like Miss Smith's?"
mr Cresswell explained.
"But," Cresswell added significantly, "capacity differs enormously between races."
"But you mean to say you can't even advise her?"
He had tried independence and philanthropy and failed.
"Fortunately," said mr Vanderpool, "Northerners and Southerners are arriving at a better mutual understanding on most of these matters."
mrs Grey wanted to hear the incident, but the young man was politely reluctant.
They were gentlemen.
"Oh, no; we can.
To her intense satisfaction, it was far more than this.
"Really, now, you do not mean to say that there is a danger of-of amalgamation, do you?" he sang.
"Yes, indeed," Cresswell agreed.
At last the Cotton Combine was to all appearances an assured fact and he was slated for the Senate.
There was just the touch of early autumn chill in the air without, that made both the fire and the table with its soft linen, gold and silver plate, and twinkling glasses a warming, satisfying sight.
"Why, I thought," said mrs Grey, "that you Southerners rather disapproved-or at least-"
"I believe in the training of people to their highest capacity." The Englishman here heartily seconded him.
mr Cresswell sipped his wine slowly.
"I thought the only excuse for fighting was a great Right; if Right is on neither side or simultaneously on both, then War is not only Hell but Damnation."
No, of course there was no immediate danger; but when people were suddenly thrust beyond their natural station, filled with wild ideas and impossible ambitions, it meant terrible danger to Southern white women.
mrs Grey wanted particulars.
Among others was one relating to child labor, another that would effect certain changes in the tariff, and a proposed law providing for a cotton bale of a shape and dimensions different from the customary-the last constituting a particularly clever artifice which, under the guise of convenience in handling, would necessitate the installation of entirely new gin and compress machinery, to be supplied, of course, by the trust.
After all why should he care?
Why should he pose as better than his fellows?
Why should he not be as other men?
Then Mary Taylor, whose conscience was uncomfortable, said:
mrs Grey was gratified and murmured something of Miss Smith's "sacrifice."
mrs Grey looked shocked and mrs Vanderpool smiled.
Did his aristocratic air prevent his succumbing to the lure of millions and promising the influence of his father and the whole Farmer's League to the new project?
Go to her."
Amedee will be a handsome bridegroom.
I was going to give you a lift, if you were done." She gathered up her reins.
From the graveyard gate one can count a dozen gayly painted farmhouses; the gilded weather vanes on the big red barns wink at each other across the green and brown and yellow fields.
It gives itself ungrudgingly to the moods of the season, holding nothing back.
Alexandra lets you sleep late.
Why aren't they up in the Catholic graveyard?"
It hurts their feelings if you don't.
One June morning a young man stood at the gate of the Norwegian graveyard, sharpening his scythe in strokes unconsciously timed to the tune he was whistling.
They still jaw about it in history classes."
Like the plains of Lombardy, it seems to rise a little to meet the sun
Oh, there's a good boy!" She turned her head to him with a quick, bright smile.
When you go out of the house into the flower garden, there you feel again the order and fine arrangement manifest all over the great farm; in the fencing and hedging, in the windbreaks and sheds, in the symmetrical pasture ponds, planted with scrub willows to give shade to the cattle in fly time.
The old wild country, the struggle in which his sister was destined to succeed while so many men broke their hearts and died, he can scarcely remember.
There were so many sheds and outbuildings grouped about it that the place looked not unlike a tiny village.
Neighboring Fields
Telephone wires hum along the white roads, which always run at right angles.
"We'd do it right over again, most of us," said the young woman hotly.
Just wait till I finish off the Kourdnas'. By the way, they were Bohemians.
Indeed, he had looked away with the purpose of not seeing it.
When he had been mowing the better part of an hour, he heard the rattle of a light cart on the road behind him.
There is even a white row of beehives in the orchard, under the walnut trees.
Marie Shabata settled herself in her seat and watched the rhythmical movement of the young man's long arms, swinging her foot as if in time to some air that was going through her mind.
"Free thinkers," replied the young woman laconically.
Maybe the supper will tempt him.
The cart stopped at the gate and a merry contralto voice called, "Almost through, Emil?" He dropped his scythe and went toward the fence, wiping his face and neck with his handkerchief. In the cart sat a young woman who wore driving gauntlets and a wide shade hat, trimmed with red poppies.
He was a splendid figure of a boy, tall and straight as a young pine tree, with a handsome head, and stormy gray eyes, deeply set under a serious brow.
A stranger, approaching it, could not help noticing the beauty and fruitfulness of the outlying fields.
From the Norwegian graveyard one looks out over a vast checker board, marked off in squares of wheat and corn; light and dark, dark and light.
The wheat cutting sometimes goes on all night as well as all day, and in good seasons there are scarcely men and horses enough to do the harvesting.
The rich soil yields heavy harvests; the dry, bracing climate and the smoothness of the land make labor easy for men and beasts.
Here I've been to town and back.
Any one thereabouts would have told you that this was one of the richest farms on the Divide, and that the farmer was a woman, Alexandra Bergson.
On either side of the road, for a mile before you reached the foot of the hill, stood tall osage orange hedges, their glossy green marking off the yellow fields.
The space between his two front teeth, which were unusually far apart, gave him the proficiency in whistling for which he was distinguished at college. (He also played the cornet in the University band.)
His wife now lies beside him, and the white shaft that marks their graves gleams across the wheat fields.
"Lots of the Bohemian boys at the University are," said Emil, taking up his scythe again.
The shaggy coat of the prairie, which they lifted to make him a bed, has vanished forever.
He felt it rather than saw it.
The grain is so heavy that it bends toward the blade and cuts like velvet.
Is anybody but you going to stand up with him?
"I gave old man Lee a cut or so, too.
"Oh, you know Annie!" She looked at the young man's bare arms.
He wore a flannel cap and duck trousers, and the sleeves of his white flannel shirt were rolled back to the elbow.
Her face, too, was rather like a poppy, round and brown, with rich color in her cheeks and lips, and her dancing yellow brown eyes bubbled with gayety.
There was something individual about the great farm, a most unusual trimness and care for detail.
"How do you know they think that?"
Lou's wife needn't talk.
One room is papered, carpeted, over furnished; the next is almost bare.
I get wet to my knees when I go down to pick cherries."
When the grass required his close attention, or when he had to stoop to cut about a head stone, he paused in his lively air,--the "Jewel" song,--taking it up where he had left it when his scythe swung free again.
"But I will be, in a minute.
Supposing that it was his sister coming back from one of her farms, he kept on with his work.
She shook her head at the tall youth.
"Alexandra sent me to mow our lot, but I've done half a dozen others, you see.
She sat with the ease that belongs to persons of an essentially happy nature, who can find a comfortable spot almost anywhere; who are supple, and quick in adapting themselves to circumstances.
Marie clucked to her horse.
They drove westward toward Norway Creek, and toward a big white house that stood on a hill, several miles across the fields.
If once I get Frank to the supper, I'll see that I stay for the dance.
Please wait for me, Marie," Emil coaxed.
All Angelique's folks are baking for it, and all Amedee's twenty cousins.
The pleasantest rooms in the house are the kitchen-where Alexandra's three young Swedish girls chatter and cook and pickle and preserve all summer long-and the sitting room, in which Alexandra has brought together the old homely furniture that the Bergsons used in their first log house, the family portraits, and the few things her mother brought from Sweden.
The wind was flapping her big hat and teasing a curl of her chestnut colored hair.
The Divide is now thickly populated.
If you go up the hill and enter Alexandra's big house, you will find that it is curiously unfinished and uneven in comfort.
The air and the earth are curiously mated and intermingled, as if the one were the breath of the other.
That's not much of a job for an athlete.
"Will you?
"Oh, there's no denying you're a spunky little bunch, you Czechs," he called back over his shoulder.
There will be barrels of beer.
Yet sometimes, in the pauses of his work, the young man frowned and looked at the ground with an intentness which suggested that even twenty one might have its problems.
You must dance with all the French girls.
Unconscious respect, probably, for he seemed intent upon his own thoughts, and, like the Gladiator's, they were far away.
"What time did you get over here?
"How brown you've got since you came home.
That is all among the dim things of childhood and has been forgotten in the brighter pattern life weaves to day, in the bright facts of being captain of the track team, and holding the interstate record for the high jump, in the all suffusing brightness of being twenty one.
They think you're proud because you've been away to school or something."
I wish I had an athlete to mow my orchard.
Lou's wife was telling me about the way she spoils you.
"I've been up looking at Angelique's wedding clothes," Marie went on, "and I'm so excited I can hardly wait until Sunday.
Could he rise from beneath it, he would not know the country under which he has been asleep.
You feel that, properly, Alexandra's house is the big out of doors, and that it is in the soil that she expresses herself best.
He was not thinking about the tired pioneers over whom his blade glittered.
"That won't last.
Oh, I don't mean all of them, I mean that low place down by my tree, where there are so many.
The old people in the mountains plant lindens to purify the forest, and to do away with the spells that come from the old trees they say have lasted from heathen times.
She sighed despondently.
Almost anything you choose."
It's then that I want to pull the corners of the Divide together.
I like to talk to Carl about New York and what a fellow can do there."
Didn't it blow dreadfully?
Don't you?"
It will go away, and things will be just as they used to. I wish you were a Catholic.
Frank sat up until a late hour reading the Sunday newspapers.
And, anyhow, there's nothing to understand!" She struck the ground with her little foot fiercely.
I suppose that's the wet season, too, then.
Emil had already begun work and was mowing vigorously.
He reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet, insipid fruit,--long ivory colored berries, tipped with faint pink, like white coral, that fall to the ground unheeded all summer through.
When I heard it raining in the night, I thought maybe you would come and do it for me to day.
Look at the spider webs all over the grass.
She had grown very pale and her eyes were shining with excitement and distress. "But, Emil, if I understand, then all our good times are over, we can never do nice things together any more.
"Thank you," he returned shortly.
Oh, but I'm glad to get this place mowed!
Just smell the wild roses!
Emil paused and straightened his back.
"Would you rather I went off in the sand hills and lived like Ivar?"
I suppose it's the wet season.
The idea!"
"Sometimes I don't want to do anything at all, and sometimes I want to pull the four corners of the Divide together,"--he threw out his arm and brought it back with a jerk,--"so, like a table cloth.
Surely you are not thinking of going off there?"
"That's a poor saying," said Emil, stooping over to wipe his hands in the wet grass.
South of the apricot trees, cornering on the wheatfield, was Frank's alfalfa, where myriads of white and yellow butterflies were always fluttering above the purple blossoms.
Marie's face fell under his brooding gaze.
What more do you want?
"I don't know.
"Yes; over.
I'm a good Catholic, but I think I could get along with caring for trees, if I hadn't anything else."
"Yes.
I like him because he appreciates her more than you do."
The Church helps people, indeed it does.
In a few moments he heard the cherries dropping smartly into the pail, and he began to swing his scythe with that long, even stroke that few American boys ever learn.
In printing the story of the young man's marital troubles, the knowing editor gave a sufficiently colored account of his career, stating the amount of his income and the manner in which he was supposed to spend it.
Aren't you splashed!
One of the Goulds was getting a divorce, and Frank took it as a personal affront.
We never had so many of them in here before.
When Emil reached the lower corner by the hedge, Marie was sitting under her white mulberry tree, the pailful of cherries beside her, looking off at the gentle, tireless swelling of the wheat.
"She wouldn't know how to go about it.
Frank read English slowly, and the more he read about this divorce case, the angrier he grew.
We shall have to behave like mr Linstrum.
"I wish you weren't so restless, and didn't get so worked up over things," she said sadly.
"Everything I say makes you cross, don't it?
Emil gripped the hand holds of his scythe and began to mow.
"Do you like mr Linstrum?" Marie asked suddenly.
"I'm sure Alexandra hopes you will stay on here," she murmured.
I'm going to pick cherries. Isn't everything beautiful after the rain?
His yellow canvas leggings and khaki trousers were splashed to the knees.
He dropped a handful into her lap.
"Do they?
Marie turned away, wringing her hands.
I feel as if this tree knows everything I ever think of when I sit here.
Frank and Lou Bergson had very similar ideas, and they were two of the political agitators of the county.
And you never used to be cross to me."
When he saw her coming, he stopped and wiped his brow.
Do you think Alexandra likes him very much?"
You don't help things any by pretending.
Then he went on in a low tone, so intense that it was almost threatening: "Sometimes you seem to understand perfectly, and then sometimes you pretend you don't.
Good bye.
She looked down at his wet leggings.
Please leave the roses till last, if you must cut them.
"And there are so many, many things I can't do." Emil echoed her tone sarcastically.
"I can't pray to have the things I want," he said slowly, "and I won't pray not to have them, not if I'm damned for it."
Alexandra can run the farm all right, without me.
I pray for you, but that's not the same as if you prayed yourself."
Well, which are the lucky trees? I'd like to know."
It would serve you all right if she walked off with Carl.
If you WON'T understand, you know, I could make you!"
"Oh, you don't know Alexandra as well as you think you do!
After he was gone, Marie went out to the back porch to begin her butter making. A brisk wind had come up and was driving puffy white clouds across the sky.
"Alexandra's never been in love, you crazy!" He laughed again.
Will you have to cut them, too?"
I never expect to have any more."
That invitation decided her.
They are always so spicy after a rain.
"Who, Alexandra?" Emil laughed and thrust his hands into his trousers pockets.
She thought it hard that the Goulds, for whom she had nothing but good will, should make her so much trouble.
Marie took up her cherries and went slowly toward the house, crying bitterly.
She and I have always been good friends.
"Why is it?
Marie clasped her hands and started up from her seat.
The orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun
You'll have to get some other little boy to play with." He stopped and took a deep breath.
I want to be doing something on my own account."
"Why not?
The wind wakened me.
She hated to see the Sunday newspapers come into the house.
Marie looked up at his defiant figure and her face clouded.
"Oh, Emil!
"If I cut the grass, I will," Emil said teasingly.
When she used to tell me about him, I always wondered whether she wasn't a little in love with him."
He turned to his farm hand who was reading the other half of the paper.
If I feel that way, I feel that way.
Emil took a step nearer and stood frowning down at her bent head. He stood in an attitude of self defense, his feet well apart, his hands clenched and drawn up at his sides, so that the cords stood out on his bare arms.
"I don't know all of them, but I know lindens are.
I get tired of seeing men and horses going up and down, up and down."
I'll call you if I see a snake."
"What are you talking about, Marie?
"That's what you miss, Marie.
I must go somewhere, mustn't I?"
Marie shrugged her shoulders.
On the evening of the day of Alexandra's call at the Shabatas', a heavy rain set in.
They were old friends."
Listen here what he do wit his money." And Frank began the catalogue of the young man's reputed extravagances.
"That's so," Marie sighed.
"I can't play with you like a little boy any more," he said slowly.
"Am I flighty?
Emil had nothing to say to this.
If you had any eyes, you would see that she is very fond of him.
She ran into the house, put on a short skirt and a pair of her husband's boots, caught up a tin pail and started for the orchard.
"Don't let me disturb you, Emil.
Frank was always reading about the doings of rich people and feeling outraged. He had an inexhaustible stock of stories about their crimes and follies, how they bribed the courts and shot down their butlers with impunity whenever they chose.
"Oh, Emil, you know what I mean!" Marie tossed her head impatiently. "Does she really care about him?
What makes you so flighty?"
It's exciting to see everything growing so fast,--and to get the grass cut!
Emil stood defiant, gazing down at her.
About like the Germans', wasn't it?"
Marie went on as if she had not heard him.
I like trees because they seem more resigned to the way they have to live than other things do.
All sorts of weeds and herbs and flowers had grown up there; splotches of wild larkspur, pale green and white spikes of hoarhound, plantations of wild cotton, tangles of foxtail and wild wheat.
"Oh, ever so much; only he seems kind of staid and school teachery. But, of course, he is older than Frank, even.
That summer the rains had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than Shabata and his man could do to keep up with the corn; the orchard was a neglected wilderness.
"She's the cunningest little thing I ever saw," said mrs Whitney, enthusiastically, afterward, aside to mr King.
"I'm afraid those wouldn't quite answer the purpose," said his mamma, smiling-"especially the last; yet we must think of something."
Polly sat up very straight, and whisked off the tears quickly.
"What?" asked Phronsie in intense interest slipping down out of Polly's arms, and crowding up close to Jasper's side.
And to be sure, our Polly's face was a study to behold.
"Now you'll stay," cried Van; "say, Polly, won't you."
"Oh Phronsie!" cried Polly, turning around at the last words; "how could you!"
I'm here, Polly!"
But Polly's arms were around the old gentleman's neck, so she didn't hear.
If she could only see Phronsie for just one moment!
"So I hope," said mrs Whitney; "and father, I do believe they'll repay you; for I do think there's good blood there; these children have a look about them that shows them worthy to be trusted."
"My son," said his mamma, "just stop and think how badly you would feel, if you really couldn't see Percy."
"I didn't have any fears, if I worked it rightly," said the old gentleman complacently.
"Boys," whispered their mother, warningly, "she can't answer you; just look at her face."
"Oh! let's go back!" was all they heard!
"Well," said Van, and he showed signs of relenting a little at that; "but Percy is perfectly awful, mamma, you don't know; and he feels so smart too," he said vindictively.
"I'd like it first rate to be away from Percy," said Van, reflectively; "I wouldn't come back in three, no, six weeks."
At this, the bundle opened suddenly, and-out popped Phronsie!
"Isn't he splendid!" cried Jasper in intense pride, swelling up.
But just here mr King thought it about time to take matters into his hands.
"So you must," cried Jasper, enchanted at his success in amusing; "and I'll go with you."
"And to think how fond the little girl is of you, father!" said mrs Whitney, who hadn't yet gotten over her extreme surprise at the old gentleman's complete subjection to the little Peppers: he, whom all children had by instinct always approached so carefully, and whom every one found it necessary to conciliate!
"I know," gasped Polly, controlling her sobs; "I won't-only-I can't thank you!"
"Then, dear," said mrs Whitney, "you must be kinder to her than ever; think what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among friends."
"Aren't you glad I've come, Polly?" asked Phronsie, with her little face close to Polly's own.
"There, there," he said soothingly, patting her brown, fuzzy head. Something was going down the old gentleman's neck, that wet his collar, and made him whisper very tenderly in her ear, "don't give way now, Polly; Phronsie'll see you."
That brought Polly to.
To think that Phronsie had left her for any one!--even good mr King!
"Where is she?" said a voice over in front of the piano, in the gathering dusk-unmistakably mr King's.
Yes, it must be confessed.
"I don't know," said Van, running over in his mind all the possible ways he could think of for entertaining anybody, "unless she'd like my new book of travels-or my velocipede," he added.
Bark!'"
All Jasper's frantic efforts at comfort, utterly failed.
It got to be noticed finally; and one and all redoubled their exertions to make everything twice as pleasant as ever!
"Phronsie," said Jasper quickly, "what do you suppose Prince said the other day?"
"Be still," said Jappy warningly, while Phronsie stood surveying them all with grave eyes.
"Dear me!" ejaculated the old gentleman, in the utmost amazement; "and such a time as I've had to get her here too!" he added, staring around on the astonished group, none of whom had a word to say.
"Oh!" she cried, coming out of her rapture a little, and springing over to mr King with Phronsie still in her arms.
The only place, except in front of the grand piano, where Polly approached a state of comparative happiness, was in the greenhouse.
"Here, Polly, hold your arms," he had only strength to gasp.
"Oh, she couldn't help it," cried mr King, beginning to walk up and down the floor, and beaming as he recalled his successful strategy; "there wasn't the smallest use in thinking of anything else.
"Well," said mrs Whitney, softly, "let's think what we can do for Polly; it makes me feel very badly to see her sad little face."
"I wasn't coming without her, Marian, if it could possibly be managed.
Here she would stay, comforted and soothed among the lovely plants and rich exotics, rejoicing the heart of Old Turner the gardener, who since Polly's first rapturous entrance, had taken her into his good graces for all time.
Every chance she could steal after practice hours were over, and after the clamorous demands of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied, was seized to fly on the wings of the wind, to the flowers.
"I can't bear it!" and over went her head on the music rack.
"Yes, all alone by himself," asserted Jasper, vehemently, and winking furiously to the others to stop their laughing; "he did now, truly, Phronsie."
"Weren't you awfully surprised?" cried Percy; "say, Polly, awfully?"
"Here I'm!
"I shall have to give up!" she moaned.
But the chubby face didn't look up brightly, as usual: and the next moment, without a bit of warning, Phronsie sprang past them all, even Polly, and flung herself into mr King's arms, in a perfect torrent of sobs.
"Oh, Phronsie!" she cried, and strained her to her heart; while the boys crowded around, and plied her with sudden questions.
But Polly stood like a statue!
"Oh ho, how funny!" laughed Van, while little Dick burst right out, "Japser!"
POLLY IS COMFORTED
Somehow, of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest, this day it seemed as if she could bear it no longer.
"So her mother was willing?" asked his daughter, curiously.
"Father knew how to do it."
But Polly couldn't speak; and if Jasper hadn't caught her just in time, she would have tumbled over backward from the stool, Phronsie and all!
yes, pretty soon now?"
"Is her name Phronsie," put in Dick, unwilling to be left out, and not thinking of anything else to ask.
"She must be there now, somewhere," and then somebody laughed.
"Phronsie," said mrs Whitney, smilingly, stooping over the child, "would you like to see a little pussy I have for you?"
"So you see, I was just in time; in the very nick of time, in fact!"
"Well, she's a nice child," he said, "a very nice child; and," straightening himself up to his fullest height, and looking so very handsome, that his daughter could not conceal her admiration, "I shall always take care of Phronsie Pepper, Marian!"
At last he came out of them, and wiped his face vigorously.
"So they have: so they have," assented mr King, and then the conversation dropped.
So, with a great many chucklings and shruggings when no one was by, he had departed after breakfast one day, simply saying he shouldn't be back to lunch.
"Don't mind it, Polly," whispered Jasper; "twasn't her fault."
At night, when no one knew it, the tears would come racing over the poor, forlorn little face, and would not be squeezed back.
Like a scene on some vague arras, old as man's weariness, the image of the seventh city of christendom was visible to him across the timeless air, no older nor more weary nor less patient of subjection than in the days of the thingmote.
The clouds were drifting above him silently and silently the seatangle was drifting below him and the grey warm air was still and a new wild life was singing in his veins.
--Duck him!
A wild angel had appeared to him, the angel of mortal youth and beauty, an envoy from the fair courts of life, to throw open before him in an instant of ecstasy the gates of all the ways of error and glory.
A full hour had passed since his father had gone in with Dan Crosby, the tutor, to find out for him something about the university.
The university!
But he, apart from them and in silence, remembered in what dread he stood of the mystery of his own body.
He recognized their speech collectively before he distinguished their faces.
He would create proudly out of the freedom and power of his soul, as the great artificer whose name he bore, a living thing, new and soaring and beautiful, impalpable, imperishable.
Words.
--One!...
So timeless seemed the grey warm air, so fluid and impersonal his own mood, that all ages were as one to him.
Yet her mistrust pricked him more keenly than his father's pride and he thought coldly how he had watched the faith which was fading down in his soul ageing and strengthening in her eyes.
He passed from the trembling bridge on to firm land again.
The water of the rivulet was dark with endless drift and mirrored the high drifting clouds.
He drew forth a phrase from his treasure and spoke it softly to himself:
Her slate blue skirts were kilted boldly about her waist and dovetailed behind her.
--Stephanos Dedalos!
He climbed to the crest of the sandhill and gazed about him.
He allowed them to glow and fade, hue after hue: sunrise gold, the russet and green of apple orchards, azure of waves, the grey fringed fleece of clouds.
Idle and embittering, finally, to argue, against his own dispassionate certitude, that the commandment of love bade us not to love our neighbour as ourselves with the same amount and intensity of love but to love him as ourselves with the same kind of love.
He looked northward towards Howth.
Angry with himself he tried to hide his face from their eyes by gazing down sideways into the shallow swirling water under the bridge but he still saw a reflection therein of their top heavy silk hats and humble tape like collars and loosely hanging clerical clothes.
--One!
For a full hour he had paced up and down, waiting: but he could wait no longer.
An ecstasy of flight made radiant his eyes and wild his breath and tremulous and wild and radiant his windswept limbs.
Guzzle him now, Towser!
He felt above him the vast indifferent dome and the calm processes of the heavenly bodies; and the earth beneath him, the earth that had borne him, had taken him to her breast.
The Europe they had come from lay out there beyond the Irish Sea, Europe of strange tongues and valleyed and woodbegirt and citadelled and of entrenched and marshalled races.
--Help!
At that instant, as it seemed to him, the air was chilled and, looking askance towards the water, he saw a flying squall darkening and crisping suddenly the tide.
What were they now but cerements shaken from the body of death-the fear he had walked in night and day, the incertitude that had ringed him round, the shame that had abased him within and without-cerements, the linens of the grave?
Help!...
--Good man, Towser!
His eyelids trembled as if they felt the vast cyclic movement of the earth and her watchers, trembled as if they felt the strange light of some new world.
Emerald and black and russet and olive, it moved beneath the current, swaying and turning.
The pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the dignity of the office he had refused.
A world, a glimmer or a flower?
Was it their colours?
His soul had arisen from the grave of boyhood, spurning her grave clothes.
He turned seaward from the road at Dollymount and as he passed on to the thin wooden bridge he felt the planks shaking with the tramp of heavily shod feet.
Their banter was not new to him and now it flattered his mild proud sovereignty.
Her thighs, fuller and soft hued as ivory, were bared almost to the hips, where the white fringes of her drawers were like feathering of soft white down.
The end he had been born to serve yet did not see had led him to escape by an unseen path and now it beckoned to him once more and a new adventure was about to be opened to him.
Duck him!
Their bodies, corpse white or suffused with a pallid golden light or rawly tanned by the sun, gleamed with the wet of the sea. Their diving stone, poised on its rude supports and rocking under their plunges, and the rough hewn stones of the sloping breakwater over which they scrambled in their horseplay gleamed with cold wet lustre.
Look out!
He could wait no longer.
--One!
Now, as never before, his strange name seemed to him a prophecy.
What hour was it?
He turned away from her suddenly and set off across the strand.
Yes, his mother was hostile to the idea, as he had read from her listless silence.
They were voyaging across the deserts of the sky, a host of nomads on the march, voyaging high over Ireland, westward bound.
Her bosom was as a bird's, soft and slight, slight and soft as the breast of some dark plumaged dove.
This was the call of life to his soul not the dull gross voice of the world of duties and despair, not the inhuman voice that had called him to the pale service of the altar.
Their piety would be like their names, like their faces, like their clothes, and it was idle for him to tell himself that their humble and contrite hearts, it might be, paid a far richer tribute of devotion than his had ever been, a gift tenfold more acceptable than his elaborate adoration.
He started up nervously from the stone block for he could no longer quench the flame in his blood.
He set off abruptly for the Bull, walking rapidly lest his father's shrill whistle might call him back; and in a few moments he had rounded the curve at the police barrack and was safe.
--Heavenly God! cried Stephen's soul, in an outburst of profane joy.
In the distance along the course of the slow flowing Liffey slender masts flecked the sky and, more distant still, the dim fabric of the city lay prone in haze.
Was it a quaint device opening a page of some medieval book of prophecies and symbols, a hawk like man flying sunward above the sea, a prophecy of the end he had been born to serve and had been following through the mists of childhood and boyhood, a symbol of the artist forging anew in his workshop out of the sluggish matter of the earth a new soaring impalpable imperishable being?
His soul was swooning into some new world, fantastic, dim, uncertain as under sea, traversed by cloudy shapes and beings.
Bous Stephaneforos!
How characterless they looked: Shuley without his deep unbuttoned collar, Ennis without his scarlet belt with the snaky clasp, and Connolly without his Norfolk coat with the flapless side pockets! It was a pain to see them, and a sword like pain to see the signs of adolescence that made repellent their pitiable nakedness.
Perhaps they had taken refuge in number and noise from the secret dread in their souls.
His throat ached with a desire to cry aloud, the cry of a hawk or eagle on high, to cry piercingly of his deliverance to the winds.
A faint click at his heart, a faint throb in his throat told him once more of how his flesh dreaded the cold infrahuman odour of the sea; yet he did not strike across the downs on his left but held straight on along the spine of rocks that pointed against the river's mouth.
All through his boyhood he had mused upon that which he had so often thought to be his destiny and when the moment had come for him to obey the call he had turned aside, obeying a wayward instinct.
The mere sight of that medley of wet nakedness chilled him to the bone.
The towels with which they smacked their bodies were heavy with cold seawater; and drenched with cold brine was their matted hair.
He stood still in deference to their calls and parried their banter with easy words.
Their feet passed in pattering tumult over his mind, the feet of hares and rabbits, the feet of harts and hinds and antelopes, until he heard them no more and remembered only a proud cadence from Newman:
He was unheeded, happy and near to the wild heart of life.
What did it mean?
To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!
He felt his cheeks aflame and his throat throbbing with song.
Evening had fallen when he woke and the sand and arid grasses of his bed glowed no longer.
It was an elfin prelude, endless and formless; and, as it grew wilder and faster, the flames leaping out of time, he seemed to hear from under the boughs and grasses wild creatures racing, their feet pattering like rain upon the leaves.
It was idle for him to move himself to be generous towards them, to tell himself that if he ever came to their gates, stripped of his pride, beaten and in beggar's weeds, that they would be generous towards him, loving him as themselves.
Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call.
No, it was not their colours: it was the poise and balance of the period itself.
--Whose feet are as the feet of harts and underneath the everlasting arms.
--Come along, Dedalus!
But her long fair hair was girlish: and girlish, and touched with the wonder of mortal beauty, her face.
She was alone and still, gazing out to sea; and when she felt his presence and the worship of his eyes her eyes turned to him in quiet sufferance of his gaze, without shame or wantonness.
A dim antagonism gathered force within him and darkened his mind as a cloud against her disloyalty and when it passed, cloud like, leaving his mind serene and dutiful towards her again, he was made aware dimly and without regret of a first noiseless sundering of their lives.
An instant of wild flight had delivered him and the cry of triumph which his lips withheld cleft his brain.
His heart trembled in an ecstasy of fear and his soul was in flight.
A moment before the ghost of the ancient kingdom of the Danes had looked forth through the vesture of the hazewrapped City.
A squad of christian brothers was on its way back from the Bull and had begun to pass, two by two, across the bridge. Soon the whole bridge was trembling and resounding.
Where was his boyhood now?
Now, at the name of the fabulous artificer, he seemed to hear the noise of dim waves and to see a winged form flying above the waves and slowly climbing the air.
Disheartened, he raised his eyes towards the slow drifting clouds, dappled and seaborne.
A veiled sunlight lit up faintly the grey sheet of water where the river was embayed.
The music came nearer and he recalled the words, the words of Shelley's fragment upon the moon wandering companionless, pale for weariness.
A great saint, saint Francis Xavier!
The chaos in which his ardour extinguished itself was a cold indifferent knowledge of himself.
But the dusk, deepening in the schoolroom, covered over his thoughts.
A certain pride, a certain awe, withheld him from offering to God even one prayer at night, though he knew it was in God's power to take away his life while he slept and hurl his soul hellward ere he could beg for mercy.
The dull light fell more faintly upon the page whereon another equation began to unfold itself slowly and to spread abroad its widening tail. It was his own soul going forth to experience, unfolding itself sin by sin, spreading abroad the bale fire of its burning stars and folding back upon itself, fading slowly, quenching its own lights and fires. They were quenched: and the cold darkness filled chaos.
--That's game ball.
The imagery of the psalms of prophecy soothed his barren pride.
Why was the sacrament of the eucharist instituted under the two species of bread and wine if Jesus Christ be present body and blood, soul and divinity, in the bread alone and in the wine alone?
He is called, as you know, the apostle of the Indies.
A gentle kick from the tall boy in the bench behind urged Stephen to ask a difficult question.
If ever his soul, re entering her dwelling shyly after the frenzy of his body's lust had spent itself, was turned towards her whose emblem is the morning star, BRIGHT AND MUSICAL, TELLING OF HEAVEN AND INFUSING PEACE, it was when her names were murmured softly by lips whereon there still lingered foul and shameful words, the savour itself of a lewd kiss.
--Is that you, pigeon?
He would follow a devious course up and down the streets, circling always nearer and nearer in a tremor of fear and joy, until his feet led him suddenly round a dark corner.
Don't make such a bally racket!
Stephen, leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler, listened to the talk about him which Heron checked from time to time by saying:
The retreat will go on from Wednesday to Friday.
--He had the faith in him that moves mountains.
--I sir?
If the wine change into vinegar and the host crumble into corruption after they have been consecrated, is Jesus Christ still present under their species as God and as man?
How comes it that while the first beatitude promises the kingdom of heaven to the poor of heart the second beatitude promises also to the meek that they shall possess the land?
That was strange.
If a layman in giving baptism pour the water before saying the words is the child baptized?
On Friday confession will be heard all the afternoon after beads.
--The boy from the house is coming up for the rector.
Does a tiny particle of the consecrated bread contain all the body and blood of Jesus Christ or a part only of the body and blood?
If a man had stolen a pound in his youth and had used that pound to amass a huge fortune how much was he obliged to give back, the pound he had stolen only or the pound together with the compound interest accruing upon it or all his huge fortune?
The bell rang. The master marked the sums and cuts to be done for the next lesson and went out.
We can scut the whole hour.
The rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson from.
--You are all familiar with the story of the life of saint Francis Xavier, I suppose, the patron of your college.
It is said that his right arm had grown powerless from having been raised so often over the heads of those whom he baptized. He wished then to go to China to win still more souls for God but he died of fever on the island of Sancian.
A little wave of quiet mirth broke forth over the class of boys from the rector's grim smile.
Why, sir?
--Hello, Bertie, any good in your mind?
He tried to think how it could be.
Do you mean to say that you are not able to tell me what a surd is?
But Saturday and Sunday being free days some boys might be inclined to think that Monday is a free day also.
All the catechisms were opened and all heads bent upon them silently.
He stooped to the evil of hypocrisy with others, sceptical of their innocence which he could cajole so easily.
If ever he was impelled to cast sin from him and to repent the impulse that moved him was the wish to be her knight.
Towards others he felt neither shame nor fear.
At his first violent sin he had felt a wave of vitality pass out of him and had feared to find his body or his soul maimed by the excess.
It was strange too that he found an arid pleasure in following up to the end the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church and penetrating into obscure silences only to hear and feel the more deeply his own condemnation.
As he sat in his bench gazing calmly at the rector's shrewd harsh face, his mind wound itself in and out of the curious questions proposed to it.
--Number ten.
Mass will be on Saturday morning at nine o'clock and general communion for the whole college.
A great soldier of God!
He is said to have baptized as many as ten thousand idolaters in one month.
The stars began to crumble and a cloud of fine stardust fell through space.
A great fisher of souls!
On the wall of his bedroom hung an illuminated scroll, the certificate of his prefecture in the college of the sodality of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
The equation on the page of his scribbler began to spread out a widening tail, eyed and starred like a peacock's; and, when the eyes and stars of its indices had been eliminated, began slowly to fold itself together again.
The rector went on gravely:
Here he is!
Instead the vital wave had carried him on its bosom out of himself and back again when it receded: and no part of body or soul had been maimed but a dark peace had been established between them.
Coming in to have a short time?
Yet as he prowled in quest of that call, his senses, stultified only by his desire, would note keenly all that wounded or shamed them; his eyes, a ring of porter froth on a clothless table or a photograph of two soldiers standing to attention or a gaudy playbill; his ears, the drawling jargon of greeting:
Her eyes seemed to regard him with mild pity; her holiness, a strange light glowing faintly upon her frail flesh, did not humiliate the sinner who approached her.
His pride in his own sin, his loveless awe of God, told him that his offence was too grievous to be atoned for in whole or in part by a false homage to the All seeing and All knowing.
I think you, Lawless, are likely to make that mistake.
At most, by an alms given to a beggar whose blessing he fled from, he might hope wearily to win for himself some measure of actual grace.
The whores would be just coming out of their houses making ready for the night, yawning lazily after their sleep and settling the hairpins in their clusters of hair. He would pass by them calmly waiting for a sudden movement of his own will or a sudden call to his sin loving soul from their soft perfumed flesh.
Beware of making that mistake.
The falsehood of his position did not pain him.
It would be a gloomy secret night.
Heron, beside Stephen, began to hum tunelessly.
--Good night, husband!
He hoped there would be stew for dinner, turnips and carrots and bruised potatoes and fat mutton pieces to be ladled out in thick peppered flour fattened sauce. Stuff it into you, his belly counselled him.
A saint who has great power in heaven, remember: power to intercede for us in our grief; power to obtain whatever we pray for if it be for the good of our souls; power above all to obtain for us the grace to repent if we be in sin.
A great saint, saint Francis Xavier!
If at moments he felt an impulse to rise from his post of honour and, confessing before them all his unworthiness, to leave the chapel, a glance at their faces restrained him.
--Shut up, will you.
What music?
The sentence of saint james which says that he who offends against one commandment becomes guilty of all, had seemed to him first a swollen phrase until he had begun to grope in the darkness of his own state.
The vast cycle of starry life bore his weary mind outward to its verge and inward to its centre, a distant music accompanying him outward and inward.
He clasped his hands on the desk and said:
He ceased to shake his clasped hands and, resting them against his forehead, looked right and left of them keenly at his listeners out of his dark stern eyes.
What did it avail to pray when he knew that his soul lusted after its own destruction?
Ennis, who had gone to the yard, came back, saying:
Ten thousand souls won for God in a single month!
Devotion had gone by the board.
He came of an old and illustrious Spanish family and you remember that he was one of the first followers of saint Ignatius.
A tall boy behind Stephen rubbed his hands and said:
A boy from his post at the window had seen the rector come from the house.
On Sunday mornings as he passed the church door he glanced coldly at the worshippers who stood bareheaded, four deep, outside the church, morally present at the mass which they could neither see nor hear. Their dull piety and the sickly smell of the cheap hair oil with which they had anointed their heads repelled him from the altar they prayed at.
Fresh Nelly is waiting on you.
A cold lucid indifference reigned in his soul.
He had sinned mortally not once but many times and he knew that, while he stood in danger of eternal damnation for the first sin alone, by every succeeding sin he multiplied his guilt and his punishment.
After early nightfall the yellow lamps would light up, here and there, the squalid quarter of the brothels.
--Well now, Ennis, I declare you have a head and so has my stick!
If any boys have special confessors perhaps it will be better for them not to change.
He went from country to country in the east, from Africa to India, from India to Japan, baptizing the people.
Stephen's heart began slowly to fold and fade with fear like a withering flower.
His days and works and thoughts could make no atonement for him, the fountains of sanctifying grace having ceased to refresh his soul.
It consisted of one small dynamo of a capacity of two hundred and eighty lights of ten c.p. each, and was housed in an unpretentious wooden shed.
But his attention was in reality concentrated closely on the supply of great centres of population, a task which he then felt might well occupy his lifetime; and except in regard to furnishing isolated plants he did not pursue further the development of hydro-electric stations.
He felt he was up against it, and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better.
"After the station had been running several months and was technically a success, we began to look after the financial part.
Copper for the circuits was more highly refined than ever before to secure the best conductivity, and purity was insisted on in every kind of insulation. Edison was intolerant of sham and shoddy, and nothing would satisfy him that could not stand cross examination by microscope, test tube, and galvanometer.
His electrolytic meter was very successful, and was of widespread use in America and in Europe until the perfection of mechanical meters by Elihu Thomson and others brought that type into general acceptance.
In this connection it should be mentioned that the Association of Edison Illuminating Companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the Edison meter was accurate, and that its use was not expensive for stations above one thousand lights; and that the best financial results were invariably secured in a station selling current by meter.
The street conductors were of the overhead pole line construction, and were installed by the construction company that had been organized by Edison to build and equip central stations. A special type of street pole had been devised by him for the three wire system.
A sudden black cloud came up, and I telephoned to Chinnock and asked him about the load.
Of course the nights were getting longer.
Not a single engine was even within gunshot of the standard thus set up, but the emergency called forth its man in Gardiner c Sims, a talented draughtsman and designer who had been engaged in locomotive construction and in the engineering department of the United States Navy.
"Our first engine compelled the inventing and making of a suitable engine indicator to indicate it-the Tabor.
The Paris plant, like that at the Crystal Palace, was a temporary exhibit.
The investors in the enterprise were ready and anxious to meet the extra cost of putting the wires underground.
Then the man called Chinnock up.
The installation of boilers, engines, dynamos, wiring, switches, fixtures, three stage regulators, and six hundred and fifty lamps, was completed in eleven days after receipt of the order, and the plant was successfully operated at the opening of the theatre, on december twelfth eighteen eighty two.
This evolution has been quite distinct, with its own inventors like Gaulard and Gibbs and Stanley, but came subsequent to the work of supplying small, dense areas of population; the art thus growing from within, and using each new gain as a means for further achievement.
Burbank and his tribe represent in the vegetable world, Edison in the mechanical.
At this time and long after, all arc lighting was done on a "flat rate" basis.
This may answer, perhaps, in a small place where the manager can gauge pretty closely from actual observation what each customer does; but even then there are elements of risk and waste; and obviously in a large city such a method would soon be likely to result in financial disaster to the plant.
They found an engine somewhat loose in the bearings, and there followed remarks which would not look well in print.
We then went to the dynamo room, where I pointed out the machines converting the steam power into electricity, appearing later in the form of light in the lamps.
Meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three wire system, known in England as the Hopkinson, both dr john Hopkinson and mr Edison being independent inventors at practically the same time.
The station at Berlin comprised five boilers, and six vertical steam engines driving by belts twelve Edison dynamos, each of about fifty five horse power capacity.
The first Edison plant in a hotel was started in October, eighteen eighty one, at the Blue Mountain House in the Adirondacks, and consisted of two "Z" dynamos with a complement of eight and sixteen candle lamps.
By digging a cheap trench and putting in an insulated cable, and connecting such station with the central part of Richmond, having the end of the cable come up into the station from the earth and there connected with motors, the power of the falls would be transmitted to these motors.
I said we were sent over to get going, and insisted on starting up on the night of the third.
With those eight dynamos we had four belts between each engine and the dynamo.
It could not be used for electroplating or deposition, nor could it charge storage batteries, all of which are easily within the ability of the direct current.
We had two wire underground feeders, sent without any plans or specifications for their installation.
It had been stepped on and flattened.
Nothing happened, however, to interfere with the successful running of the station, and for twenty years thereafter the same two dynamos continued to furnish light in Sunbury.
They were later used as reserve machines, and finally, with the engine, retired from service as part of the "Collection of Edisonia"; but they remain in practically as good condition as when installed in eighteen eighty three.
Soon after the station went into operation this ingenious plan was changed, and the third dynamo was replaced by two others.
It was literally the beginning of the electrical illumination of American Expositions, carried later to such splendid displays as those of the Chicago World's Fair in eighteen ninety three, Buffalo in nineteen o one, and saint Louis in nineteen o four.
One ammeter, for measuring the quantity of current output, was interpolated in the "neutral bus" or third wire return circuit to indicate when the load on the two machines was out of balance.
This new plant takes high tension polyphase current from a water power thirty or forty miles away at Paderno, on the river Adda, flowing from the Apennines; but delivers low tension direct current for distribution to the regular Edison three wire system throughout Milan.
Note has already been made of the first Edison plants afloat on the Jeannette and Columbia, and the first commercial plant in the New York lithographic establishment.
Its thin wires can be carried cheaply over vast areas, and at each local point of consumption the transformer of size exactly proportioned to its local task takes the high voltage transmission current and lowers its potential at a ratio of twenty or forty to one, for use in distribution and consumption circuits.
He had been connected with local telephone interests, but resigned to take active charge of this plant, imbibing quickly the traditional Edison spirit, working hard all day and sleeping in the station at night on a cot brought there for that purpose.
The organization was crude, the steam engineering talent poor, and owing to the impossibility of getting any considerable capital subscribed, the plants were put in as cheaply as possible.
The Sunbury generating plant consisted of an Armington and Sims engine driving two small Edison dynamos having a total capacity of about four hundred lamps of sixteen c.p.
We had an Armington and Sims engine with sight feed oiler.
The hotel is situated at an elevation of thirty five hundred feet above the sea, and was at that time forty miles from the railroad.
There Messrs. Johnson and Hammer put into practice many of the ideas now standard in the art, and secured much useful data for the work in New York, of which the story has just been told.
Every department of mechanics was stimulated and benefited to an extraordinary degree.
Hence the Edison electrolytic meter is no longer used, despite its excellent qualities.
The invention is in universal use today, alike for direct and for alternating current, and as well in the equipment of large buildings as in the distribution system of the most extensive central station networks.
Among the exhibits of that Exposition was the Edison system of incandescent lighting.
The arc lamp installed outside a customer's premises, or in a circuit for public street lighting, burned so many hours nightly, so many nights in the month; and was paid for at that rate, subject to rebate for hours when the lamp might be out through accident.
Sunbury was also provided with the first electro chemical meters used in the United States outside New York City, so that it served also to accentuate electrical practice in a most vital respect-namely, the measurement of the electrical energy supplied to customers.
Owing to his insistence on low pressure, direct current for use in densely populated districts, as the only safe and truly universal, profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers, Edison has been frequently spoken of as an opponent of the alternating current.
The first permanent Edison station in Europe was that at Milan, Italy, for which the order was given as early as May, eighteen eighty two, by an enterprising syndicate.
Returning to the more specific subject of pioneer plants of importance, that at Brockton must be considered for a moment, chiefly for the reason that the city was the first in the world to possess an Edison station distributing current through an underground three wire network of conductors-the essentially modern contemporaneous practice, standard twenty five years later.
"In the second year we put the Stock Exchange on the circuits of the station, but were very fearful that there would be a combination of heavy demand and a dark day, and that there would be an overloaded station.
For a six hour run of the plant one quarter of a cord of wood was required, at a cost of twenty five cents per cord.
He weighed and reweighed the meter plates, and pursued every line of investigation imaginable, but all in vain.
He did so.
This does him an injustice.
The station had neither voltmeter nor ammeter.
The station equipment at Brockton consisted at first of three dynamos, one of which was so arranged as to supply both sides of the system during light loads by a breakdown switch connection.
After that they were shown the meters by which the consumption of current was measured.
The first cold day after starting the station, people began to come in from their offices, especially down in Front Street and Water Street, saying the meter was on fire.
The most interesting feature of this installation was the employment of special deep-sea lamps, supplied with current through a cable nine hundred and forty feet in length, for the purpose of alluring fish.
We put many customers on, but did not make out many bills.
Brockton had a good deal of pride in its fine trees, and a strong sentiment was very soon aroused against the mutilation proposed so thoughtlessly.
The eccentric strap had a round glass oil cup with a brass base that screwed into the strap.
I knew Chinnock to be square and of good business ability, and induced him to leave his job.
We were at the machine works, Goerck Street.
I believe that this construction department was unkindly named the 'Destruction Department.' It served its purpose; never made any money; and I had the unpleasant task of presiding at its obsequies."
I made him a personal guarantee, that if he would take hold of the station and put it on a commercial basis, and pay five per cent. on six hundred thousand dollars, I would give him ten thousand dollars out of my own pocket.
That was left to others, and to the application of the alternating current, which has enabled engineers to harness remote powers, and, within thoroughly economical limits, transmit thousands of horse power as much as two hundred miles at pressures of eighty thousand and one hundred thousand volts.
The early arc lamps were rated to require nine to ten amperes of current, at forty five volts pressure each, receiving which they were estimated to give two thousand c.p., which was arrived at by adding together the light found at four different positions, so that in reality the actual light was about five hundred c.p.
The meter continued in general service during eighteen ninety nine, and probably up to the close of the century.
No, sir.
The standard Edison meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the central station company for examination, another set being substituted. The meter was cheap to manufacture and install, and not at all liable to get out of order.
We had no means of boring out the field magnets, and we cut grooves in them. I think the machine is still running (nineteen o seven).
The difficulty of obtaining engineers in those days to run the high-speed engines (three hundred and fifty revolutions per minute) is well illustrated by an amusing incident in the very early history of the station.
We started to collect some bills; but we found that our books were kept badly, and that the person in charge, who was no business man, had neglected that part of it.
The theatre was never piped for gas! It was also from the Brockton central station that current was first supplied to a fire engine house-another display of remarkably early belief in the trustworthiness of the service, under conditions where continuity of lighting was vital.
I had never seen one, and did not know how it worked, with the result that we soon burned up the babbitt metal in the bearings and spent a good part of the night getting them in order.
Of these two Brockton required the larger plant, but with the conductors placed underground. It was the first to complete its arrangements and close its contract. mr Henry Villard, it will be remembered, had married the daughter of Garrison, the famous abolitionist, and it was through his relationship with the Garrison family that Brockton came to have the honor of exemplifying so soon the principles of an entirely new art.
I then had a standard made to hold another oil cup, so as to see and regulate the drop feed.
The heat from this lamp would prevent the liquid from freezing, so that the meter could go on doing its duty.
When the alternating current was introduced for practical purposes it was not needed for arc lighting, the circuit for which, from a single dynamo, would often be twenty or thirty miles in length, its current having a pressure of not less than five or six thousand volts.
When it got very cold the metal would contract and close a circuit, and throw a lamp into circuit inside the meter.
IT BECAME THE BASIS OF MODERN HEAVY CURRENT TECHNICS." The last phrase is italicized as being a happy and authoritative description, as well as a tribute.
They appeared to be interested, and I proceeded to enter upon a comparison of coal made into gas or burned under a boiler to be converted into electricity.
Thus the art was set going in the United States under many difficulties, but with every sign of coming triumph.
Desiring to put this new system into practical use promptly, and receiving applications for licenses from all over the country, Edison selected brockton massachusetts, and Sunbury, Pennsylvania, as the two towns for the trial.
Few of these data were ever actually used, however; and it was all more or less a matter of guesswork, although the central station manager, aiming to give good service, would naturally see that the dynamos were so operated as to maintain as steadily as possible the normal potential and current.
It is true that even down to the present time the flat rate is applied to a great deal of incandescent lighting, each lamp being charged for individually according to its probable consumption during each month.
The boilers were fired by wood, as the economical transportation of coal was a physical impossibility.
Everything he has done has been aimed at the conservation of energy, the contraction of space, the intensification of culture.
Once again he went to the customer's meter to look around, when a small piece of thick wire on the floor caught his eye. The problem was solved.
Reference has already been made to the work abroad in Paris and London.
Edison was from the first deeply impressed with the possibilities of water power, and, as this incident shows, was prompt to seize such a very early opportunity.
We were using coal costing twelve dollars a ton, and were paid for our light in currency worth fifty cents on the dollar.
They said they 'were sorry'--that is, 'Wall Street sorry'--and refused to pay it.
The International Electrical Exposition at Paris was intended to place before the eyes of the civilized world the achievements of the century.
He obtained the desired speed and load with a friction brake; also regulator of speed; but waited for an indicator to verify it.
For some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits, and that reason was often urged against it seriously.
The dynamo electric machine, though small, was robust, for under all the varying speeds of water power, and the vicissitudes of the plant to which it, belonged, it continued in active use until eighteen ninety nine--seventeen years.
A model of this station is preserved in the Deutschen Museum at Munich.
When the lights or motors in the circuit are turned on, and a certain definite small portion of the current is diverted to flow through the meter, from the positive plate to the negative plate, the latter increases in weight by receiving a deposit of metallic zinc; the positive plate meantime losing in weight by the metal thus carried away from it.
I took it up, and it had solved the engine oiling problem-and my walk to Lawrence like a tramp actor's was off!
In fact, he did not know anything about the station, anyway. So I got the directors to permit me to hire a man to run the station. This was mr Chinnock, who was then superintendent of the Metropolitan Telephone Company of New York.
The strong position held by the Edison system, under the strenuous competition that was already springing up, was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system; and it gave an immediate impetus to incandescent lighting.
Some idea of the confidence inspired by the fame of Edison at this period is shown by the fact that the first theatre ever lighted from a central station by incandescent lamps was designed this year, and opened in eighteen eighty four at Brockton with an equipment of three hundred lamps.
The ladies thanked me effusively and brought their visit to a close.
mr Andrews and I worked in collaboration until the night of the third.
Having travelled around the world, I had cultivated an indifference to any special difficulties of that kind.
There was an average cost per lamp for meter operation of twenty two cents a year, and each meter took care of an average of seventeen lamps.
The London plant was less temporary, but not permanent, supplying before it was torn out no fewer than three thousand lamps in hotels, churches, stores, and dwellings in the vicinity of Holborn Viaduct.
It went into service august fifteenth eighteen eighty two, about three weeks before the Pearl Street station.
One evening there came a sudden flash of fire and a spluttering, sizzling noise.
The electrical work had to be done in forty eight hours!
The Edison construction department took entire charge of the installation of the plant, and the formal opening was attended on october first eighteen eighty three, by mr Edison, who then remained a week in ceaseless study and consultation over the conditions developed by this initial three wire underground plant.
The first mill plant was placed in the woollen factory of james Harrison at Newburgh, New York, about september fifteenth eighteen eighty one.
Andrews skipped from under; he obeyed orders; I did not.
Why, if we erect a station at the falls, it is a great economy to get it up to the city.
Edison, however, had satisfied himself that there were various ways of accomplishing the task, and had determined that the current should be measured on the premises of every consumer.
He did not want his customers to count the heart beats of the engine in the flicker of the lamp.
But the plant ran, and it was the first three wire station in this country."
This arrangement interfered with correct meter registration, as the meters on one side of the system registered backward during the hours in which the combination was employed.
As a matter of fact the first Edison commercial station to be operated in this country was that at appleton wisconsin, but its only serious claim to notice is that it was the initial one of the system driven by water power.
Edison held that the electricity sold must be measured just like gas or water, and he proceeded to develop a meter.
It was a time of uninterrupted watchfulness.
We had an index like a steam gauge, called an ampere meter, to indicate the amount of current going out.
I might remark in this connection that years afterward I applied to the Edison Electric Light Company asking them if they would not like to pay me this money, as it was spent when I was very hard up and made the company a success, and was the foundation of their present prosperity.
The Jury of Awards, in presenting four medals to the Edison company, took occasion to pay a high compliment to the efficiency of the system.
I telephoned again, and felt something would happen, but fortunately it did not.
mr Sprague realized the trouble, quickly threw off the current and stopped the engine.
To prevent these electrolytes from freezing we had in each meter a strip of metal.
I requested him to make a sheet brass oil cup and solder it to the base I had.
About that time mr Andrews and I came together.
The machinery was taken up in pieces on the backs of mules from the foot of the mountain.
It has been thought by many that the magnificent success of this plant did more to stimulate the growth of the incandescent lighting business than any other event in the history of the Edison company.
On july fourth the Sunbury plant was put into commercial operation by Edison, and he remained a week studying its conditions and watching for any unforeseen difficulty that might arise.
This pioneer system was operated continuously until february ninth nineteen hundred, or for a period of about seventeen years, when the sturdy old machines, still in excellent condition, were put out of service, so that a larger plant could be installed to meet the demand.
It was at this central station that Lieutenant Sprague began his historic work on the electric motor; and here that another distinguished engineer and inventor, mr h Ward Leonard, installed the meters and became meter man, in order that he might study in every intimate detail the improvements and refinements necessary in that branch of the industry.
His swoop became a demonstration merely, an expression of his rage at having his prey thus snatched from his beak. With one short, shrill cry of anger, he swerved off and sailed upward over the river.
For all the splendor of his plumage, the merganser was not conspicuous where he sat
But the hawk was already close upon him.
The duck was a handsome male of the red breasted merganser family, and the absorbing interest of his life was fish.
But the antic forest Fates, wearied of the simple routine of the wilderness, had decreed an altogether novel intervention, and were giggling in their cloaks of ancient moss.
But behind him, overtaking him inexorably, came the shape that stood for doom itself in the eyes of all his tribe-the dreadful blue falcon, or duck hawk.
He would have been drowned, the breath battered clean out of him, in half a minute more, had he maintained the hopelessly unequal struggle.
Close ahead of him now the teal saw refuge-the flashing line of the rapids.
A pounce, and the great cat had her paw upon it, and crouched snarling up at the hawk.
A few yards further on, the torrent fell seething over a long ledge into a pool of brief quiet.
The pool was, perhaps, a hundred yards in length.
Here he proceeded to swallow his prize head first.
Just about this time, in the clear blue overhead, a green winged teal was beating his way above the treetops, making for the stream with the fear of death at his heart.
The hawk, embittered by the loss of his first quarry, had become as dogged in pursuit as a weasel, not to be shaken off or evaded or deceived.
But wisdom came to him just in time, and he did not strike home.
He had no rending claws.
Once more he half emerged, filled his gasping lungs, and pounded onward desperately, half flying and half swimming.
The Fisher in the Chutes
Like his unfortunate little cousin, the teal, he, too, had felt the fear of death smitten into his heart, and was heading desperately for the refuge of some dark overhanging bank, deep fringed with weeds, where the dreadful eye of the hawk should not discern him.
But water was all they clutched.
The teal's wings, throbbing with a swift, short vibration, whistled shrilly in the still air, so that a prowling wildcat by the waterside heard the sound even above the dull roar of the rapids, and glared upward alertly.
The hawk sat upon the branch and watched his quarry swimming beneath the surface.
In despair he hurled himself downward too soon.
The rapids were foam white, or golden ruddy, or deep, shining green brown under the sharp and patchy sunlight, and they were sown thickly with wet black rocks, here and there glinting with purple.
It was a mongrel method of progression, in which he was singularly expert.
Just as he made his cast, he saw the fleeing drake and the pursuing hawk come round the bend.
Had he taken such a prize, he could not have profited by it, having no means of tearing it to pieces.
He dived and caught it, came to the surface and swallowed it. Much refreshed, he looked about him.
Then the leader parted from the line.
The great hawk followed hurriedly, to retrieve his prey from the ground.
Immediately over his outstretched gleaming head flew the hawk.
The drag upon his beak and the light check upon his wings were inexplicable to him, and appalling.
He rose noisily into the air, made a detour over the tree tops to avoid the fisherman, and flew back to his dead branch overhanging the amber rush of the chutes.
At the sudden sharp sting of it, the great bird turned his head and noticed, for the first time, the fisherman standing on the bank.
At the same moment he felt the light restraint of the almost invisible leader upon his wings, where the other two flies had affixed themselves.
As it chanced, however, the victim came down with a thud almost beneath the whiskered nose of the wildcat.
His beak, with its keen toothed edges, was a formidable weapon, by means of which he could doubtless have captured, disabled, and dragged to shore even a fish of a pound or so in weight.
The hawk followed, his wing tips now almost brushing the water.
His feet were red, his long narrow beak, with its saw toothed edges and sharp hooked tip, was bright red.
The fisher of the chutes, meanwhile, was swimming straight downstream for the broken water.
The drake, unrealizing that the dreadful chase was done, sped onward beneath the surface till he could go without breath no longer.
With only head and wings above the mad smother, he flapped onward frantically, beating down the foam about him.
The odds, however, were now laid heavily against the fugitive.
He saw the frantic fugitive dive over the ledge and disappear.
Where the waves for an instant sank, they came closer,--but not quite within grasping reach.
The merganser had a crested head of iridescent green black, a broad collar of lustrous white, black back, black and white wings, white belly, sides finely pencilled in black and white, and a breast of rich chestnut red, streaked with black.
Moreover, he was not in the situation or the surroundings which one is wont to associate with ducks.
Straightway the hawk glided from his perch and darted after him.
The cat growled softly, picked up the prize in her jaws and trotted into the bushes to devour it.
Almost instantly he was forced to the top.
The rapids would presently come to an end.
It directly overhung a transparent amber brown chute of unbroken water in the midst of the loud turmoil of North Fork Rapids.
He had three flies on his cast, and, because in these waters there was always the chance of hooking a grilse, he was using heavy tackle.
For a moment the fisherman, bewildered, tried to play him like a salmon.
Here, where the North Fork stream fell into the Ottanoonsis, was a resort exactly to his liking.
For all its appalling speed, the sound of his flight was nothing more than a strong pulsating hiss.
Happily for him, he on his part caught sight of the hawk, and dropped like lead into the torrent.
The drake was suspicious of men, though he did not greatly fear them, as he and his rank fleshed tribe were not interesting to the hunters.
It was not in the quiet pools and long, deep reaches of dark water that he loved to seek his prey, but rather to snatch it from the grasp of the loud chutes and the roaring rips.
Then he came up among some arrowweeds, lifted his head beneath the shelter of one of the broad barbed leaves, and floated there quivering.
The marauder from the upper air was waiting till his quarry should reach less turbulent waters.
And most of the fish-trout, salmon, grilse or parr-which journeyed up and down either the Fork or the parent river chose to pass through that sluice of swift but unbroken flow immediately beneath the overhanging branch on which he perched.
He tried to check his cast, but it was too late.
The hawk alighted on the dead branch, and sat upright, motionless, as if surprised.
There was no such thing as a hawk in sight.
Immediately beyond the lip of the ledge the hawk lifted his wings high over his back and struck downward, so that his talons went deep into the water.
But suddenly, straight and swift as a diving cormorant, he shot down into the torrent and disappeared beneath the surface.
He was too imposing in appearance, too gorgeous in apparel, too bold and vigilant in demeanor to be so misunderstood.
A watcher directly overhead, escaping the baffling reflections, might have seen him swimming, head outstretched, mastering the tremendous rush of the stream with mighty strokes, fairly out speeding the fish in their own element. Near the limit of the clear water he overtook and seized the quarry which he had marked-a trout not far from seven inches in length.
For a good ten minutes he waited, moveless, with the patience of the wild things. Then his terror faded, appetite once more began to invite his attention, and he took note of a minnow flickering slowly over the sun flecked mud below him.
But, as before, the leaping waves of the rapids were too much for his pursuer, and he was able to flap his way onward in a cloud of foam, while doom hung low above his head, yet hesitated to strike.
His flies, as befitted these amber brown, tumultuous northern streams, were large and conspicuous-a Parmacheenie Belle for the tail fly, with a Montreal and a Red Hackle for the drops.
The drake sank again instantly.
The wily drake had plunged with the plunge of the fall itself, and was now darting onward at a safe depth.
As long as his body was completely submerged, it was at the mercy of the twisting and tortured currents, which rolled him over and over, in spite of his swimming craft.
He saw the great hawk swoop savagely.
He was plainly a duck.
Then, in the still water, unless he should chance upon a hiding place, the drake would soon be forced to come to the top for breath, and those throttling talons would instantly close upon his neck.
The last drop fly, as luck would have it, caught just in the corner of the hawk's angrily open beak, hooking itself firmly.
This branch was thrust out very obligingly in just the place where this most singular of ducks would have desired it if it had been consulted in the matter.
The fisherman reeled in the limp coils, and the worried hawk flew off with the flies.
In fact, he had just finished it-the last of the trout's tail had just vanished with a spasm down his strained gullet-when the baffled hawk caught sight of him and swooped.
It was enough, however, and the unhappy teal was hurled earthward, flapping through the tips of the branches.
The spot where all this happened was perhaps a hundred yards below that dead tree upon whose outthrust naked branch the splendid merganser drake was making his meal.
In every line and hue he was unmistakably an aristocrat among ducks, and an arrogant one at that.
But here he was at a terrible disadvantage as compared with the owls, hawks, and eagles.
In fact, after the fashion of a cormorant or a kingfisher, he was perched motionless on a big dead stub of a branch.
Now the object of this soliloquy is plain.
And so on, till you get to the end, when Ophelia might say, "Ah, yes," or something non committal of that sort.
What is it?
Stagecraft is the art of getting over these and other difficulties, and (if possible) getting over them in a showy manner, so that people will say, "How remarkable his stagecraft is for so young a writer," when otherwise they mightn't have noticed it at all.
But even the unsuccessful dramatist has his moments.
A stage meal is popular, because it proves to the audience that the actors, even when called Charles Hawtrey or Owen Nares, are real people just like you and me.
This is how it should go:--
Do play it again.
How shall this success be achieved?
Lend me your ear for ten minutes, and you shall learn just what stagecraft is." And I should begin with a short homily on
How shall I do it?"--well, I couldn't help you.
Let your actors have tea by all means, but see that it is a properly histrionic tea.
Which strikes me as rather sweet and natural.
Arthur!
No, "be"--b e.
The obvious answer, that the firm which is mentioned in the programme as supplying his trousers would be annoyed if he didn't, is not enough; nor is it enough to say that the whole plot of the piece hinges on him, and that without him the drama would languish.
The etiquette is to have two bites before the butler and the three footmen whisk away the plate.
Well, I see I must tell you.
If that be so, he must explain it.
And, so on in the same vein for some thirty lines.
A cynic is a man who, etc...
Sugar?
Let us assume further that you wish Lord john to reply, "A cynic is a man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing."
Quite one of my favourites.
How do you do?
Then is the time to introduce a meal on the stage.
What, then, is to be done?
What you want is to make it clear that you are conveying Hamlet's thoughts to the audience in rather a clever manner.
No, thanks.
Was it only a coincidence?
THE COMPLETE DRAMATIST
Tea, please, Matthews.
Frankly I cannot always say.
Most of the characters seem to be on the stage, and for once we do not ask how they got there.
If you ever read your "Shakespeare"--and no dramatist should despise the works of another dramatist; he may always pick up something in them which may be useful for his next play-if you ever read your "Shakespeare," it is possible that you have come across this passage:
The successful playwright is indeed a man to be envied. Leaving aside for the moment the question of super tax, the prizes which fall to his lot are worth something of an effort.
Can you give me a few hints?"--suppose you spoke to me like this, then I could do something for you.
Let us assume that Lord Arthur asks Lord john what a cynic is-the question of what a cynic is having arisen quite naturally in the course of the plot.
I want double nine two three-sorry....
Tea is the most usual meal on the stage, for the reason that it is the least expensive, the property lump of sugar being dusted and used again on the next night.
SOLILOQUY
These few remarks are called a soliloquy, being addressed rather to the world in general than to any particular person on the stage.
"My dear Sir," I should reply (or Madam), "you have come to the right shop.
Whatever-
So the soliloquy came into being.
But it is the cigarette which chiefly has brought the modern drama to its present state of perfection.
Once more:---
There are ways of shifting the eyebrows, distending the nostrils, and exploring the lower molars with the tongue by which it is possible to denote respectively Surprise, Defiance and Doubt.
Is that you, Exchange?
Thank you.
Without the stage cigarette many an epigram would pass unnoticed, many an actor's hands would be much more noticeable; and the man who works the fireproof safety curtain would lose even the small amount of excitement which at present attaches to his job.
Why did Lord Arthur Fluffinose enter?
The only thing is, I don't know anything about technique and stagecraft and the three unities and that sort of rot.
You will never be a dramatist until you have learnt the technique of
In short he becomes a "prominent figure in London Society"--and, if he is not careful, somebody will say so.
You see how effective it is.
You will, of course, appreciate that the unfinished sentences not only save time, but also make the manoeuvring very much more natural.
Well, there are more ways than one; and now we come to what is meant by stagecraft.
Besides, the thing is coming back again as chicken directly.
Larkspur!
Yes, m'lady.
EXITS AND ENTRANCES
Could anything be more natural?
Let us, to give an example of how this method works, go back again to the play we have been discussing.
It was an unsatisfying life; and when rash acquaintances asked him what he did, he used to say that he was for the Bar.
But suppose you said, "I'm fond of writing; my people always say my letters home are good enough for 'Punch.' I've got a little idea for a play about a man and a woman and another woman, and-but perhaps I'd better keep the plot a secret for the moment.
Now this answer, even if it comes quite fresh to the stalls, will lose much of its effect if it is said without the assistance of a cigarette.
It makes a different thing of it altogether.
To be or not to be, that is the question; whether 'tis nobler-
Of course, a really good actor can often give a clue to the feelings of a character simply by facial expression.
It has been said before, but you may feel that it is quite time it was said again; besides, for all the audience knows, Lord john may simply be quoting.
Good bye; so glad you could come.
Hamlet speaking.
To be or not to be, that is the question; whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows-What? No, Hamlet speaking.
A cynic is a man who, etc
Charming.
It is to let Hamlet, if that happen to be the name of your character, enter with a small dog, pet falcon, mongoose, tame bear or whatever animal is most in keeping with the part, and confide in this animal such sorrows, hopes or secret history as the audience has got to know.
This would be an easy way of doing it, but it would not be the best way, for the reason that it is too easy to call attention to itself.
Now although it is possible, in the case of a few men at the top of the profession, to leave the conduct of the cigarette entirely to the actor, you will find it much more satisfactory to insert in the stage directions the particular movements (with match and so forth) that you wish carried out.
Then the curtain rises, and it is apparent that we are assisting at an At Home of considerable splendour.
Yes, that's right.
The answer to this will depend upon the length of the play, for upon the length depends the hour at which the curtain rises.
And so on.
You will see this for yourself if you consider the passage as it should properly have been written:--
