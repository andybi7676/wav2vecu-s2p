The horse wrangler is the fellow who goes out and rounds up the ponies.
"The cows'll sleep themselves out of sight before you get there, if you don't get a move on."
In a few moments they, too, had turned their ponies adrift and had thrown themselves down beside their companions, pulling their blankets well about them, for the night had grown chill.
I wouldn't have saddled it but the boss said I must.
The fourth guard has to eat yet, so there is plenty of time. How did you all sleep?"
"Who is the wrangler this morning?" asked the foreman, glancing about at his men.
"Anywhere-everywhere.
It was the Chinaman, Pong, sounding his call for breakfast, in accordance with the usage of the plains.
"You will find your stuff rolled up under the chuck wagon, boys," said Stallings.
There'll be a lively muss about the time you do, I reckon, and you'll wish you hadn't.
Almost before the echoes of his voice had died away, a shrill voice piped up from the tail end of the chuck wagon.
Say, don't you?"
In spite of their hard couches the Pony Riders slept soundly, even Professor Zepplin himself never waking the whole night through.
These they spread out on the ground, using boots wrapped in coats for pillows.
Chunky, however, was too sleepy to see anything so small as a cowman swinging his arms a rod away.
Stacy grumbled, turned over and went to sleep again.
Why not?" demanded the boy.
"I hardly think they would do that, Pong."
"Where are they?" asked the boy.
The boss said the first man he heard using language while you tenderfeet were with us, would get fired on the spot."
"Listen."
"We will now get to work on the herd," announced the foreman.
"Fine," chorused the boys.
"Allee same likee this," he explained.
Pong, going through the motions of drawing a gun from his belt, and puffing out his cheeks, uttered an explosive "pouf!"
There's the pony ready for you.
"Now, I don't want you fellows sitting up all night," objected the foreman.
The rest of the fourth guard had already gone out, Chunky meeting the returning members of the third coming in.
The cowman was swinging his arms and seeking to attract the lad's attention.
"Not on the range?
It is astonishing with how little a man can get along when he has to."
Stacy shot up into the air as if he had been propelled from a bow gun. He struck the soft sand several feet in advance of the pony, his face and head ploughing a little furrow as he drove along on his nose.
"Better not try it out on the range," smiled the foreman.
"What do you want?" demanded the boy.
"You're lucky to be alive in this outfit, let alone filling yourself with grub.
Besides holding the untrustworthy horses, it afforded a temporary corral for catching a change of mounts.
You can enjoy yourselves sleeping just as well as sitting up."
"A wrangler's a wrangler," answered Big foot stolidly.
The meal was soon finished, Pong having stood rubbing his palms, a happy smile on his face, during the time they were eating.
Tad's eyes were sparkling from the experiences of the evening, as well as from the praise bestowed upon him by the big cowpuncher.
"I guess there are some words that aren't in the dictionary," laughed Tad.
"Pong, tell the young gentlemen what would become of you if you were to serve bad meals to this outfit of cowpunchers."
"Little black bull came down the hillside, Down the hillside, down the hillside, Little black bull came down the hillside, Long time ago."
"He's a fellow who's all the time making trouble, isn't he?" asked Stacy innocently.
"How?" asked Tad.
"Is breakfast ready?" asked the boy, tightening his belt and jamming his sombrero down over his head.
"Keep still, you baby!" growled the cowman.
The foreman nodded, with an approving glance at Tad.
"I think you will find them all there, Master Tad, if you will consult the big book," said the Professor.
"Oh, no, this kind of a wrangler isn't," laughed the foreman.
This effectually quieted the boy for the night, and the camp settled down to silence and to sleep.
If you can't keep shut, the boss'll be for making you sleep under the chuck wagon.
The camp fire was burning brightly when the first guard, having completed its tour of duty, came galloping in.
"You boys don't have to swallow your food whole," smiled the foreman, observing that the Pony Riders seemed to think they were expected to hurry through their meal as well.
"Don't you know any more than to try to get onto a broncho from the off side?
Instantly there was a chorus of yells and snarls from the disturbed cowpunchers, accompanied by dire threats as to what they would do to the gopher did he ever disturb their rest in that way again.
Stacy ruefully, and still half asleep, made a wide circle around the sleeping cowmen that he might not make the mistake of again stepping on any of them.
"Beds?" grunted Big foot.
Walter had gone out with the second guard, and the others had gathered around the camp fire for their nightly story telling.
"I guess we are pretty sure of having real food to eat, then," laughed Tad, as the boys rose from the table ready for the active work of the day.
"Roll out!
"Wrangler?
"The pony did most of it," admitted the lad.
"Those fellows have to go out.
It seemed as if scarcely a minute had passed since the boys turned in before they were awakened by the strident tones of the foreman.
"More than most tenderfeet would have done," growled Big foot.
"I don't call that much of a song," sniffed Chunky contemptuously after a moment of silence on the part of the group.
The Chinaman showed two rows of white teeth in his expansive grin.
By the time the cowmen and Pony Riders had refreshed themselves at the spring near which the outfit had camped, a steaming hot breakfast had been spread on the ground, with a slicker for a table cloth.
"Where are your beds?" asked Stacy after the foreman had urged the boys to get to sleep.
"What do you mean?" asked Ned Rector.
Get a move on you and keep still.
What's a wrangler?" demanded Stacy, delaying the progress of a large slice of bacon, which hung suspended from the fork half-way between plate and mouth.
With Stacy Brown, however, severe measures were necessary when one of the returning guard routed him out at half past three in the morning.
The cowboy did this very thing, but within an hour he found himself alone, the others having turned in one by one.
"Hi, there!" hissed Lumpy, filled with indignation that anyone should attempt to mount a pony from the right side.
"I just gave him his head, and that's all there was to it."
"It's your trick.
"I am," spoke up Shorty Savage promptly.
In floundering about, making up his bunk, the lad had fallen over two cowboys and stepped full on the face of a third.
THE FIRST NIGHT IN CAMP
"When you get to be half as good a man on cows as your friend the Pinto, here, you'll be a full grown man," added Big foot.
He's a trouble curer, not a troublemaker, except for himself."
You won't be so fast to wake up hard working cowboys after that, I reckon."
A loud laugh followed at Chunky's expense.
Stacy Brown's left leg swung over the saddle. No sooner had the pony felt the leather over him than he raised his back straight up, his head going down almost to the ground.
"It's the 'Cowboy's Lament,'" laughed Bob Stallings.
"Do you want to wake up the whole outfit?
Lumpy Bates came running toward him, not daring to call out for fear of waking the camp.
Stacy Brown proved the only grumbler in the lot, declaring that he could not sleep a wink on such a bed as that.
"I'll give it as a horseback opinion that the only way to enjoy such a night as this, is to sit up until you fall asleep with your boots on.
He shook the lad violently.
"Even if I can't sing, I can beat that."
"Bob thinks it might stampede the herd," spoke up Big foot Sanders.
Take your time.
"We had better start the drive this morning.
"None of you will be fit for duty to morrow.
Sometimes he does it in the middle of the night when the thunder and lightning are smashing about him like all possessed, and the cattle are on the rampage.
"Surprisingly well.
In a few moments the sound of singing was borne to the ears of the campers.
"A very fine breakfast, sir," announced the Professor, looking up at the Chinaman.
"Better hurry up, kid," they chuckled.
Out on the plains the fourth guard were drowsily crooning the lullaby about the bull that "came down the hillside, long time ago."
Our beds, on the plains, are wherever we happen to pull our boots off."
"Does it make any difference?"
His warning came too late.
CHAPTER four
"Breakfast?" jeered Lumpy.
Roll out!" he roared, bringing the sleepy cowpunchers grumbling to their feet.
At first the pony began to buck; then, evidently thinking the effort was not worth while, settled down to a rough trot which soon shook the boy up and thoroughly awakened him.
That's the way I'm going to do it, to night."
If you make a racket there, Pong will dump a pot of boiling water over you.
Lumpy watched him with disapproving eyes.
"Oh, you mean they would shoot you?" asked Walter.
The guard chanced to be Lumpy Bates, and he administered, what to him, was a gentle kick, to hurry the boy along.
"The Pinto rounded up a bunch of stray cows to night as well as I could do it myself, and he didn't go about it with a brass band either."
"And you, mr Professor?"
Off on the plain they heard a rich tenor voice raised in the song of the cowman.
The lad caught the pony that stood moping in the corral, not appearing to be aware that his rider was preparing him for the range, Chunky all the time muttering to himself.
We've got a hard drive before us, and every man must be fit as a fiddle.
Chunky reached the table first, greedily surveying what had been placed on it.
"If you haven't I would advise you to go easy.
We'll do it three times, and the one who wins two times out of three will be it."
"Yes."
Chunky colored.
"Had anything to eat!" asked the guide.
The little animals were becoming more sure footed every day, and Ned said that, before the trip was finished, "Jimmie" would be able to walk a slack rope.
Let me have that hat, Tad," he demanded as the latter came trotting up to the group.
He slapped Texas sharply on the flank with the flat of his hand.
A temporary camp was quickly pitched.
"Then, I think I'll try some myself," announced Ned, helping himself liberally to the honey and jam.
"Cold water is the most nourishing thing we've touched since last night."
This time the battle lay between Tad Butler and Ned Rector.
Then Chunky essayed the feat.
He buried his biscuit under a layer of jam, over which he spread a thick coating of honey.
Why, mr Thomas, where did you get honey?" asked Walter.
ROUGH RIDERS IN THE SADDLE
The great, green field, surrounded on all sides by tall trees, made the place an ideal one for their purpose.
Perhaps Tuesday.
The third heat was merely a repetition of the second.
It must have come to life some time during the night and dug its way out," laughed Tad.
Stacy, his face flushed, determination plainly showing in his eyes, stretched forth his hand for the sombrero.
The fire would be ready and thus no time would be lost in preparing the first meal of the day, which, in this case, would be breakfast, dinner and supper all in one.
It was a beautiful race, the little Indian ponies seeming to enter thoroughly into the spirit of the contest, stretching themselves out to their full lengths, and, with heads on a level with their backs, fairly flew across the great plot of green.
"Now, fall to, young gentlemen," directed the Professor.
"Yes; wild plum jam," answered the guide.
It looks like jam."
Ned took his defeat good naturedly.
Riding bravely out into the field, he tossed it to the ground.
"Not enough to give us indigestion," answered Ned.
Besides this, there are many abandoned mines up the range further.
A stout club for mine."
"What I want to know, is, when do we go hunting?" asked Ned.
"Are you hurt?" asked Tad apprehensively.
Chunky did even better than that.
"We did not.
"Remember, sir, that a certain amount of dignity befits the office of president of the Pony Riders Club," he said.
"I've seen them do that in the wild west shows too many times not to know how myself."
CHAPTER twelve
They assured him that nothing was further from their intention, and quickly casting aside guns and cartridge belts, they threw themselves into their saddles again for a jolly romp.
"It's good, anyway."
"I'll show you," promised Tad.
The boys were now all anxiety to start, while the ponies, after their Sunday rest, were almost as full of life as were their owners.
Walter smiled, with a twinkle in his eyes.
Even Stacy Brown, though he did not sit his saddle with the same grace that marked the riding of Tad Butler and Ned Rector, more practiced horsemen, was nevertheless no mean rider.
All agreed that Tad's superior horsemanship, alone, had won the race for him.
This announcement filled the boys with excitement.
Ned fixed him with a stern eye.
Fortunately, his right foot freed itself from the stirrup at the same time, or there might have been a different ending.
"Hooray, fellows!" he shouted.
Tad hitched in his saddle a little, throwing the greater part of his weight on the stirrups.
To this all agreed.
"I don't need guns to hunt with.
By this time, the boys had come to feel fully as much at home in the saddle as they formerly had been out of it.
The next two heats were different.
"We'll take all chances," advised Ned.
"We are in the bear country now.
You don't have to move the hat, you ninny."
"And we've got a surprise for you," announced Stacy, swelling with pride.
Texas seemed to leap clear of the ground, planting himself on all fours just over the line, the winner by a neck.
"I will," replied Chunky, confidently.
Didn't you find it?"
"I am free to admit that I am hungry, too.
I couldn't get it," explained Chunky.
I can do that myself," he grunted.
With a shout, the boys dashed pell mell to meet the pack train, and, falling in behind the slow moving burros, urged them on with derisive shouts and sundry resounding slaps on the animals' flanks.
That's nothing.
The boys awaited the guide's approach with impatience, some pacing back and forth, while others coaxed the fire into a roaring blaze, at the same time confiding to each other how hungry they were.
"A cave?" interrupted Tad.
At the moment when he freed his left foot from the stirrup, he threw his body sharply to the right, reaching for the hat without taking the precaution to grasp the pommel.
"Are there bears up here?"
"Suppose we start with a race?
An early start was made, so that the party reached the promised table lands shortly before ten o'clock in the forenoon.
"I'd lose my dignity for a mouthful of that, any day," he decided after having sampled the combination. "President Brown, I withdraw my criticism.
It was a gladsome sound to this band of hungry boys, whose ordinarily healthy appetites, under the bracing mountain air and the long fast, had taken on what the Professor described as a "razor edge."
"Honey?
The trail is so plainly marked that he can't miss it."
I think I shall help myself to some of that wild plum jam and biscuit, first It reminds me of old times.
"Found a bee tree on my way back, and cut it down.
"Now you may go," he nodded.
He no doubt would bring food of some kind with him.
We'll race the length of the field and back.
"He's got to learn," declared Tad.
We sometimes had jam when I was with the German----"
"But what's this!
"Army," added Ned.
"Why don't you move the pony?
Supper having been finished, the party gathered about the camp fire for their evening chat, after which, admonishing Stacy to keep within his tent and not to go borrowing trouble, the boys turned in for a sound sleep.
Chunky turned a double somersault, lay still for a moment, then struggled up, rubbing his body gingerly, as the rest of the party came hurrying up to him.
The guide said that, by making a detour in their journey that day, they would cross table lands several acres in extent and covered with grass.
Of course, dogs can't follow the trail of an animal as well, now, as they could with snow on the ground.
"I guess I had better go along to see that you do not."
I offer you my humble apologies.
"Why not show us, then?" he said.
"Be careful, Chunky," warned Walter.
But this dog, you will find, is a wonder.
At their urgent request, Professor Zepplin told the boys to go ahead and enjoy themselves.
Stacy dismounted and removed the hat carefully to one side.
Walter Perkins won the heat.
What do you think of that?"
Next thing we know you'll be providing us with bear steak."
Up to within a moment of the finish of the second heat the two ponies were racing neck and neck.
"Huh!
"But I left you a rabbit.
As yet, they had been unable to attempt any fancy riding with their ponies, owing to the rugged nature of the country through which they had been journeying.
Guess I know how to ride.
We shall need a dog.
Grasping the pommel with the left hand, he appeared to dive head first toward the ground.
Galloping into camp the boy fetched his sombrero, which he carried well out into the field and tossed away.
As a result, instead of stopping when he reached the hat, the boy kept on going.
"Don't you worry about me, Ned Rector.
By the time the meal was ready the tents had been pitched and the boys had returned from the spring, rubbing their faces with their coarse towels, their cheeks glowing and their eyes sparkling in anticipation of the feast.
But I know an old settler who will lend us his dog, if it is not out.
"Got your life insured?" asked Ned.
"I reckon there are," smiled the guide.
"All you want.
"That depends.
"I think I'll ride my own pony and let the dog walk," announced Ned.
"You'll see when you get to camp," answered Chunky.
All at once he dropped to the saddle and slipped the left foot from the stirrup.
"Yes, the country is full of caves.
I came near losing my life too, and----"
"Stand still.
Ain't no use to expect him to hook himself onto the line, even if he does wake up," decided the guide with emphasis, beginning to haul up the lariat, which he coiled neatly on the rock in front of him.
All I can see is rocks and shadows.
After winding the end tightly about his own arm, he handed a lighted torch to Tad.
I'll go down, mr Thomas."
Cautiously placing a hand against the rocks to steady himself, Tad wisely concluded that hereafter it would not pay to be too curious.
To this question Walter made some reply that was unintelligible to them.
"I am the one to go after Walt, if anyone has to.
"Here, put my gun in your pocket."
There was no response.
Will it be all right for me to swing myself?"
"no
Walter had fully regained consciousness by this time, and a brief examination showed that he had sustained no serious injury, he having struck on the yielding branches of the pinyon, which broke his fall and saved his life.
Tell them Walt's all right.
Can you slip it over your shoulders and under your arms?" called the guide.
"Now, be very careful.
Where is it that you think you see bushes?"
"I protest!" shouted the Professor.
Can you make it out?"
Hey, Walter!
"Yes."
Then followed a long period of suspense.
"Now, what are we going to do, I'd like to know?" asked Ned.
Don't bother him.
But he doesn't answer me."
But I don't dare try it.
"Is it possible!
But, before removing the rope from your own body, make sure that you are safe.
"In that case, you will have to go yourself, Thomas," decided the Professor sharply.
Running to the edge of the cliff, he leaned over and listened intently.
And that tumble's enough to knock the sense out of a full grown man.
What are we going to do, Thomas-how are we to rescue the boy?"
"See anything?" asked Tad tremulously, creeping to his side.
"He's so far to the right of me that I can't reach him.
"What is it?" demanded the Professor breathlessly.
"Yes," agreed Tad, "that does look like bushes.
"Where-is-he?" stammered the Professor, not observing that the guide had left them.
Be sure to fasten him securely to the loop before you give the signal to haul up," warned the guide.
"One of us must go down there," was the guide's startling announcement.
Closing his eyes, he clung to the slender support with grim courage until a hail from above told him that the rawhide loop was rapidly squirming down toward him.
"Where is he?"
"Has-he---gone?" asked the Professor weakly.
"All right.
"Don't move around.
After what seemed to them hours, a sharp call from the depths reached their ears.
"Hold a torch over the edge of the cliff, Master Ned," directed the guide.
"I know-I know-but----"
"You'll all be over if you don't have a care.
Very slowly, restraining their inclination to haul the rope in with all speed only because the warning eyes of the guide were upon them, the two boys, assisted by Professor Zepplin, began hoisting Walter Perkins toward the top.
"I heard him call.
"Looks like a clump of bushes down there.
Now try it."
Something else besides saying you're going to will be necessary."
"It's a tough job.
"Let me go, mr Thomas," interrupted Ned Rector, stepping forward, with almost a challenge in his eyes.
Run over to the cook tent and tell Jose to give you those rawhide lariats that he will find behind his bunk.
"You'd have both of us at the bottom if I left it to you to take care of this end."
"Yes, that's the only way we can do it.
I don't dare try any experiments."
Lie perfectly still," warned the guide.
"I understand."
Walt's alive!
"Are you ready?"
As he did so, Tad felt himself gradually sinking into the sombre depths.
We've got to get Walt up here, even if I have to jump over after him," said Tad firmly.
But talking won't do it.
"All right, old man.
"It's Master Walt," snapped the guide.
"Good!" approved Lige encouragingly, beginning to let the rawhide slip slowly around the trunk of the tree.
"Yes; haul away.
I'll send down another rope to which you can tie yourself until we get Master Walter to the top.
"Right!" announced the guide in a reassuring voice.
They gazed at each other in perplexity.
"Wait a minute," cautioned the mountaineer.
Keep your eyes shut till I tell you to open them."
Stick tight and don't get scared.
"Are you all safe down there, Tad?"
"Are you hurt?"
"Fainted, probably.
The shout of joy that had framed itself on the lips of Ned Rector and Stacy Brown died out in an indistinct murmur.
"Why not get a rope and let it down to him," suggested Tad.
"Keep still!
"I see him," called Tad, his voice sounding hollow and unnatural to those above.
The boy could not repress a shudder.
The guide, without further delay, and giving no heed to Professor Zepplin's nervous protests, slipped the noose over Tad's shoulders, and, drawing it down and up under his arms, secured the knot so that the loop might not tighten under the weight of the boy's body.
If you find the support too weak to bear your weight, let me know.
But I don't know how we are going to get him."
"Then what are we going to do?
"Sure thing!" answered the boy.
But from the cautious movements of the light far below them, the guide understood that the lad was at work carrying out his part of the task of rescue to the best of his ability.
The mountaineer quickly formed a loop in one end of the rope, making it large enough to permit of its slipping over the shoulders of a man.
Hurry!"
"Yes?
"And he most certainly will," interrupted Tad, advancing a step.
I'm going back for a torch," he commanded, leaping by them on his way to the camp fire.
Got him?" he answered, leaning over the cliff.
"What would you suggest!"
A DARING RESCUE
A moment more and he too caught the plaintive cry for help from below.
Don't move an inch.
"Hello, down there!
But I ain't sure.
He tilted his head to look up.
"Down there, sir," explained Tad, pointing to the ledge of rock over which Walter had fallen.
"Better lie down so you, too, don't take a notion to fall off.
"It will be better for him to go, if he will----"
The boy's doing the best he can.
"Over there to the right, just near the edge of the light space made by the torch light," answered the guide.
We'll have you out of that in no time."
He ain't very strong, you know.
Let me know when the rope reaches you.
"Lodged in the branches of a pinyon tree, I think it is.
"Master Tad is right," decided the guide, gazing at the two boys approvingly.
He can talk now," was the answer that carried with it such a note of gladness that Ned and Stacy were unable to resist a shout of joy.
"I am needed right here, sir," replied the guide, shortly.
"What do you think has happened to him?" asked Tad in a troubled voice.
"Keep back!
The creaking of the rawhide told them that Tad Butler was swaying from side to side, fifty feet below them, at the end of a slender line.
You are----"
Keep back!" he shouted, as the boys and Professor Zepplin began crowding near the masked edge of the cliff.
The movement sent his body swaying giddily from side to side.
"Right you are, young man.
And, if you meet with anything unlooked for, let me know at once.
It was a trying moment for all of them, and naturally more so for the boy who was about to descend into the unknown depths of the mountain canyou.
"no
"Glad and proud to do it." "With no doubt, no fear, to mar your consent." "Not one, David." "That's true love, Christie!"
I, too, have prepared for it, and even spoken to mrs Amory.
"I've done it, mother: tell me you're not sorry."
"I go too."
That was all: she did not offer to detain him now; he did not deny her right to follow.
When the deed was once done, it was astonishing what satisfaction they all took in it, how soon they got accustomed to the change, and what pride they felt in "our soldier." The loyal frenzy fell upon the three quiet women, and they could not do too much for their country.
Wash had heard drums every five minutes since he arrived, but this time he was right, and began to cheer the instant a red cockade appeared at the other end of the long street.
"I mean it as honestly as you do.
But I think few brides dress with a braver, happier heart than mine, though I do choose a sober wedding gown," answered Christie, smiling again, as she took from a half packed trunk her new hospital suit of soft, gray, woollen stuff.
"No, I will be married in my uniform as David is," she answered with a look Letty long remembered.
Ah! but it was that old mother worked and waited for so long: blind now, and deaf; childish, and half dead with many hardships, but safe and free at last; and Hepsey's black face was full of a pride, a peace, and happiness more eloquent and touching than any speech or sermon ever uttered.
"Of course he has! any man with the spirit of a muskeeter would."
"Go dear, I'll come directly.
How time went that day!
Here he is, my knight without reproach or fear, going out to take his part in the grandest battle ever fought.
"I thought that would fetch him!"
"Come and walk a little in the lane."
She never had yet, and now resolved to ask nothing, but to earn her blessing by doing her share in the great work.
"Then you are quite willing to try the third great experiment?"
"Dear, I must go."
"How terrible!
"My precious people, I've got something to tell you: are you ready?"
Nature abhors a vacuum, and when food fell short patriotism had a chance to fill the aching void.
Then they stood quite still for a time, and in the silence the two hearts talked together in the sweet language no tongue can utter. Presently David said regretfully:
"O David, you are splendid!
"This;" and he held out his hand with a little paper in it.
Christie was lifted out of herself for the moment, and looked inspired by the high mood which was but the beginning of a nobler life for her.
"I shall remember that," was all David answered to that last promise of hers, and three months later he took her at her word.
"Quite ready."
But nothing seemed to rouse the supine Elisha, who chewed his quid like a placid beast of the field, and showed no sign of a proper spirit.
"Yes, David."
"Only this," and she touched the flowers, adding with her hand on the blue coat sleeve that embraced her: "I want to consecrate my uniform as you do yours by being married in it.
"Give the last kiss to mother," added Letty, following her example, and in another minute David was gone.
Imagine her dismay, when, having consumed the bait, her fish gave signs of breaking the line, and escaping after all; for mr Wilkins pushed back his chair, and said slowly, as he filled his pipe:
"mr
David and Christie went smiling away together, and if they shed any tears over the brief happiness no one saw them but the flowers, and they loyally kept the secret folded up in their tender hearts.
What shall you choose, Davy?"
"I must go!" cried David with a sort of desperation, as Letty clung to one arm, Christie to the other.
Surely I shall if I give you and myself to the cause; and I do it gladly, though I know that my heart has got to ache as it never has ached yet, when my courage fails, as it will by and by, and my selfish soul counts the cost of my offering after the excitement is over.
He went, and Christie vanished to make ready for her wedding, conscious, in spite of her exalted state of mind, that every thing was very hurried, sad, and strange, and very different from the happy day she had so often planned.
Power has come," she said softly a few minutes later, with an anxious glance at the clock.
As the inspiring music, the grand tramp drew near, Christie felt the old thrill and longed to fall in and follow the flag anywhere.
She understood, put both arms about his neck as if to keep him safe, and whispered fervently:
Now, let's be brave and enjoy every minute of it."
Help me to be brave and strong, David: don't let me complain or regret, but show me what lies beyond, and teach me to believe that simply doing the right is reward and happiness enough."
This was a favorite dish of Lisha's, and she had prepared it as a bait for this cautious fish. To say that the fish rose at once and swallowed the bait, hook and all, but feebly expresses the justice done to the cakes by that long suffering man.
"I could not love thee, dear, so much, Loved I not honor more."
"I thought he'd give me violets," and a shadow came over Christie's face.
A very simple little marriage feast, but more love, good will, and tender wishes adorned the plain table than is often found at wedding breakfasts; and better than any speech or song was Letty's broken whisper, as she folded her arms round David's empty chair when no one saw her, "Heaven bless and keep and bring him back to us."
But first"--and Christie held her friend close a moment, kissed her tenderly, and whispered in a broken voice: "Remember, I don't take his heart from you, I only share it with my sister and my mother."
Isn't it fitter for a soldier's wife than lace and silk at such a time as this?"
Power is waiting: are you ready, love?"
David meantime was in camp, getting his first taste of martial life, and not liking it any better than he thought he should; but no one heard a complaint, and he never regretted his "love among the roses," for he was one of the men who had a "principle as well as a weapon," and meant to do good service with both.
"David Sterlin' has enlisted!"
When mr Power presently came in, followed by the others, they found their soldier standing very erect in his old place on the rug, with the firelight gleaming on his bright buttons, and Bran staring at him with a perplexed aspect; for the uniform, shorn hair, trimmed beard, and a certain lofty carriage of the head so changed his master that the sagacious beast was disturbed.
"Yes, David," sister and sweetheart answered, bravely forgetting in the fervor of the moment what heavy consequences God might see fit to send.
Once all was wild enthusiasm and glad uproar; now men's lips were set, and women's smileless even as they cheered; fewer handkerchiefs whitened the air, for wet eyes needed them; and sudden lulls, almost solemn in their stillness, followed the acclamations of the crowd.
"I'll keep it, David."
mrs Sterling clasped her hands and bowed her head.
"Another great battle!" screamed the excited news boys in the streets.
"Have no fear for me: I feel as if I could bear any thing just now; for I've got into a heroic mood and I mean to keep so as long as I can.
Even the lookers on were different.
Poor rations did not suit him, and he demanded why his favorite dishes were not forthcoming.
I be, I be!" and the inconsistent woman fell upon his buttony breast weeping copiously.
Can you bear it, love?"
At the turn of the lane, he looked back and swung his cap; all waved their hands to him; and then he marched away to the great work before him, leaving those loving hearts to ask the unanswerable question: "How will he come home?"
"He's a comin', Ma!" called Gusty, presently.
"But they are mourning flowers, you know."
"I'll try," was all his answer to her appeal; then proved that he meant it by adding, with his lips against her cheek: "I must go to mother and Letty.
"Yes, Christie."
"No bridal white, dear?" said David, going to her.
He said no more but fell a thinking.
"Now, Cynthy, be you satisfied?"
"Ready, my General."
"Keep your promise, dear," he answered, while the warlike expression changed to one of infinite tenderness.
Finding that Lisha showed little enthusiasm on the subject, she tried to rouse him by patriotic appeals of various sorts.
"Nothing can part us any more, not even death; for love like ours will last for ever."
He accepted all that came, and furnished forth those of his company who were less favored. Among these was Elisha Wilkins, and how he got there should be told.
"Good!
Which threat she carried out with such skill and force that Lisha was effectually waked up, for he was "partial to good vittles," and Cynthy was a capital cook.
"I'm glad I done it; for it will make a man of Lisha; and, if I've sent him to his death, God knows he'll be fitter to die than if he stayed here idlin' his life away."
Christie was going to town to see the regiment off, and soon followed with mr Power.
She put her arm in his, and answered quickly:
"We are ordered off at once, and go at four this afternoon.
Yes, mr Power, I've found my hero at last!
I've always wanted to live in stirring times, to have a part in great deeds, to sacrifice and suffer something for a principle or a person; and now I have my wish.
We leave them behind, and they must be comforted."
"David sends you these, dear.
"What promise?"
mrs Sterling cut up her treasured old linen without a murmur; Letty made "comfort bags" by the dozen, put up jelly, and sewed on blue jackets with tireless industry; while Christie proclaimed that if she had twenty lovers she would send them all; and then made preparations enough to nurse the entire party.
"I'm glad to give him to you, Christie; for now I feel as if I had partly paid the great debt I've owed so long," answered Letty through her tears.
"THEN THEY WERE MARRIED."
"My dearest Christie, don't be superstitious: all brides wear roses, and Davy thought you'd like them," said Letty, troubled at her words.
Before mrs Wilkins could reply to these conflicting rumors her husband walked in, looking as martial as his hollow chest and thin legs permitted, and, turning his cap nervously in his hands, said half proudly, half reproachfully:
He's a kind, neighborly man, and his boy will take my place about the house and protect you faithfully.
Lisha Wilkins, look at that, and say no e f you darst!"
"You mean it?"
"Lisha, ain't you got no heart?
Letty smiled at him approvingly, then went to comfort her mother who could not recover her tranquillity so soon.
"You've something to tell me: I see it in your face."
But Christie stood aloof, looking at her lover with something more than admiration in the face that kindled beautifully as she exclaimed:
Now it's all so hurried, sorrowful, and strange.
"Then I'm satisfied."

Alice and Mary stood by with eyes fixed on the poor child, whose struggles seemed to increase, till at last his mother said with a choking voice,
"We mun get him away from his mother.
But as he turned to catch a look at her sweet face, he saw that it expressed unfeigned distress, almost amounting to vexation; a dread of him, that he thought was almost repugnance.
But earnest as the father was in watching the yet living, he had eyes and ears for all that concerned the dead, and sprang gently up, and took his dead son on his hard couch in his arms with tender strength, and carried him upstairs as if afraid of wakening him.
"Dead!"
She bent down, and fondly, oh! with what passionate fondness, kissed her child, and then gave him up to Alice, who took him with tender care.
I think I cannot go right, for I either check myself till I'm downright cross to him, or else I speak just natural, and that's too kind and tender by half.
Again Alice laid out the dead, Mary helping with reverent fear.
Jem went to the cupboard, and quietly extricated from his pocket the oranges he had bought.
"Oh, Jem, don't give way so; I cannot bear to see you."
He had stolen out during the half hour allowed at the works for tea, to buy them an orange or two, which now puffed out his jacket pocket.
Mary's heart melted within her as she witnessed Jem's sorrow, and she stepped gently up to the corner where he stood, with his back turned to them, and putting her hand softly on his arm, said,
They cried afresh in company.
"Where is he?" asked Mary.
The ghoul like fever was not to be braved with impunity, and baulked of its prey.
They took worse about two o'clock.
He cannot die while she's wishing him."
So food for four mouths was all she was now required to find; only for three she would have said; for herself and the unweaned child were but reckoned as one in her calculation.
So leaving kind messages to George and Jane Wilson, and hesitating whether she might dare to send a few kind words to Jem, and deciding that she had better not, she stepped out into the bright morning light, so fresh a contrast to the darkened room where death had been.
But when the twins, after ailing many days, and caring little for their meat, fell sick on the same afternoon, with the same heavy stupor of suffering, the three hearts that loved them so, each felt, though none acknowledged to the other, that they had little chance for life.
But just now he hardly saw her; he went straight up to Alice, and asked how the little chaps were.
How she would surround him with every comfort she could devise (of course, he was to live with them), till he should acknowledge riches to be very pleasant things, and bless his lady daughter!
Mary mechanically helped Alice in all the duties she performed through the remainder of that long night, but she did not see Jem again.
Her thoughts ran on Jem's manner and words; not but what she had known the tale they told for many a day; but still she wished he had not put it so plainly.
"They're both gone," said she.
And I'm as good as engaged to be married to another; and another far handsomer than Jem; only I think I like Jem's face best for all that; liking's liking, and there's no help for it.
The board, not so formidable as she had imagined, had inquired into her case; and, instead of sending her to Stoke Claypole, her husband's Buckinghamshire parish, as she had dreaded, had agreed to pay her rent.
They were like many a pair of twins, and seemed to have but one life divided between them.
Nature's struggles were soon exhausted, and he breathed his little life away in peace.
Over the child, which yet breathed, the father bent, watching anxiously for some ground of hope, where hope there was none.
He could not contain himself.
Partly to relieve her from his presence, and partly from natural desire, and partly, perhaps, from a penitent wish to share to the utmost his parents' sorrow, he soon went up stairs to the chamber of death.
Her plan of living was so far arranged, when she heard, with keen sorrow, that Wilson's twin lads were ill of the fever.
"Don't, Jem, please don't," whispered she again, believing that his silence was only another form of grief.
Mary lay down on her bed in her clothes; and whether it was this, or the broad daylight that poured in through the sky window, or whether it was over excitement, it was long before she could catch a wink of sleep.
Well, when I'm mrs Harry Carson, may happen I can put some good fortune in Jem's way.
Jem felt a strange leap of joy in his heart, and knew the power she had of comforting him.
I took "Napoleon Announcing the Divorce to Josephine" for my frontispiece.
We decided to have a country Christmas, without any help from town.
The men could not go farther than the barns and corral.
He used to help my father cut Christmas trees for me in Virginia, and he had not forgotten how much I liked them.
I can see them now, exactly as they looked, working about the table in the lamplight: Jake with his heavy features, so rudely moulded that his face seemed, somehow, unfinished; Otto with his half ear and the savage scar that made his upper lip curl so ferociously under his twisted mustache.
I put on my cap and ran out to meet Jake.
The cold was not severe, but the storm was quiet and resistless.
The flakes came down so thickly that from the sitting room windows I could not see beyond the windmill-its frame looked dim and gray, unsubstantial like a shadow.
On the day before Christmas, Jake packed the things we were sending to the Shimerdas in his saddle bags and set off on grandfather's gray gelding. When he mounted his horse at the door, I saw that he had a hatchet slung to his belt, and he gave grandmother a meaning look which told me he was planning a surprise for me.
The snow did not stop falling all day, or during the night that followed.
We put sheets of cotton wool under it for a snow field, and Jake's pocket mirror for a frozen lake.
We bound it between pasteboards, which I covered with brilliant calico, representing scenes from a circus.
Grandmother hunted up her fancy cake cutters and baked gingerbread men and roosters, which we decorated with burnt sugar and red cinnamon drops.
Its real splendors, however, came from the most unlikely place in the world-from Otto's cowboy trunk.
Jake was sure he could get through on horseback, and bring home our things in saddle bags; but grandfather told him the roads would be obliterated, and a newcomer in the country would be lost ten times over.
For two days I sat at the dining room table, pasting this book full of pictures for Yulka.
When I got to the pond I could see that he was bringing in a little cedar tree across his pommel.
We had files of those good old family magazines which used to publish colored lithographs of popular paintings, and I was allowed to use some of these.
On the white pages I grouped Sunday School cards and advertising cards which I had brought from my "old country." Fuchs got out the old candle moulds and made tallow candles.
Our tree became the talking tree of the fairy tale; legends and stories nestled like birds in its branches.
The cedar was about five feet high and very shapely.
She cut squares of cotton cloth and we sewed them together into a book.
I had wanted to get some picture books for Yulka and Antonia; even Yulka was able to read a little now.
They sat about the house most of the day as if it were Sunday; greasing their boots, mending their suspenders, plaiting whiplashes.
As I remember them, what unprotected faces they were; their very roughness and violence made them defenseless.
As we turned back to the sitting room, grandfather looked at me searchingly.
He stood in the little entry hall, the lantern and his fur cap under his arm, shaking hands with us.
Because he talked so little, his words had a peculiar force; they were not worn dull from constant use.
He had come to thank us for the presents, and for all grandmother's kindness to his family.
His face had a look of weariness and pleasure, like that of sick people when they feel relief from pain.
He said almost nothing, and smiled rarely; but as he rested there we all had a sense of his utter content.
He sat still and passive, his head resting against the back of the wooden rocking chair, his hands relaxed upon the arms.
He always wrote to her on Christmas Day, he said, no matter where he was, and no matter how long it had been since his last letter.
As we sat down to the table, it occurred to me that he liked to look at us, and that our faces were open books to him.
Grandmother insisted on his drinking a glass of Virginia apple brandy after his long walk in the cold, and when a faint flush came up in his cheeks, his features might have been cut out of a shell, they were so transparent.
Morning prayers were longer than usual.
Then Jake and I played dominoes, while Otto wrote a long letter home to his mother.
At about four o'clock a visitor appeared: mr Shimerda, wearing his rabbit skin cap and collar, and new mittens his wife had knitted.
I suppose, in the crowded clutter of their cave, the old man had come to believe that peace and order had vanished from the earth, or existed only in the old world he had left so far behind.
It was a soft gray day outside, with heavy clouds working across the sky, and occasional squalls of snow.
Jake and Otto shouted "Merry Christmas"! to me, and winked at each other when they saw the waffle irons on the stove. Grandfather came down, wearing a white shirt and his Sunday coat.
Grandfather's prayers were often very interesting.
His prayers reflected what he was thinking about at the time, and it was chiefly through them that we got to know his feelings and his views about things.
"The prayers of all good people are good," he said quietly.
He read the chapters from saint Matthew about the birth of Christ, and as we listened it all seemed like something that had happened lately, and near at hand.
At nine o'clock mr Shimerda lighted one of our lanterns and put on his overcoat and fur collar.
All afternoon he sat in the dining room.
In his prayer he thanked the Lord for the first Christmas, and for all that it had meant to the world ever since.
When the candle ends sent up their conical yellow flames, all the colored figures from Austria stood out clear and full of meaning against the green boughs.
As it grew dark, I asked whether I might light the Christmas tree before the lamp was brought.
This feeling seemed completely to take possession of mr Shimerda.
When his deep seeing eyes rested on me, I felt as if he were looking far ahead into the future for me, down the road I would have to travel.
There were always odd jobs to be done about the barn on holidays, and the men were busy until afternoon.
After we sat down to our waffles and sausage, Jake told us how pleased the Shimerdas had been with their presents; even Ambrosch was friendly and went to the creek with him to cut the Christmas tree.
He gave thanks for our food and comfort, and prayed for the poor and destitute in great cities, where the struggle for life was harder than it was here with us.
His long body formed a letter "S." I saw grandmother look apprehensively at grandfather. He was rather narrow in religious matters, and sometimes spoke out and hurt people's feelings.
He had the gift of simple and moving expression.
We persuaded our guest to stay for supper with us.
He needed little urging.
The cattle in the corral ate corn almost as fast as the men could shell it for them, and we hoped they would be ready for an early market.
"You've got a birthday present this time, Jim, and no mistake.
When I beg him for play, he shake his head no
thirteen
The soft black earth stood out in patches along the roadsides.
At noon that day the hens had not been heard from.
Now read me a chapter in 'The Prince of the House of David.' Let's forget the Bohemians."
He is very smart boy.
If I got all things like you, I make much better."
One morning the two big bulls, Gladstone and Brigham Young, thought spring had come, and they began to tease and butt at each other across the barbed wire that separated them. Soon they got angry.
When I went down to breakfast that morning, Jake and Otto came in white as snow men, beating their hands and stamping their feet.
Ambrosch be rich, too, after while, and he pay back.
"Your grandfather is rich," she retorted fiercely.
Clearly, the affair had to be stopped.
Each withdrew to a far corner of his own corral, and then they made for each other at a gallop. Thud, thud, we could hear the impact of their great heads, and their bellowing shook the pans on the kitchen shelves.
By five o'clock the chores were done-just when it was time to begin them all over again!
Some days he take his violin out of his box and make with his fingers on the strings, like this, but never he make the music.
In the kitchen she caught up an iron pot that stood on the back of the stove and said: "You got many, Shimerdas no got." I thought it weak minded of grandmother to give the pot to her.
After dinner Jake and Otto, their damp clothes now dried on them, stretched their stiff arms and plunged again into the drifts.
Grandmother chuckled and drove her bright needle across a hole in Otto's sock.
We found the chickens asleep; perhaps they thought night had come to stay.
We could not so much as see the corrals, but we knew the steers were over there, huddled together under the north bank. Our ferocious bulls, subdued enough by this time, were probably warming each other's backs.
I was so annoyed that I felt coldly even toward Antonia and listened unsympathetically when she told me her father was not well.
Though Antonia loved her father more than she did any one else, she stood in awe of her elder brother.
For Ambrosch my mama come here."
The snow did not fall this time, it simply spilled out of heaven, like thousands of feather beds being emptied.
He not look good.
"This'll take the bile out of 'em!" Fuchs remarked gleefully.
Had they not been dehorned, they would have torn each other to pieces.
We had three weeks of this mild, open weather.
He never make music any more.
"We don't make them come here."
At home he play violin all the time; for weddings and for dance. Here never.
They bellowed and pawed up the soft earth with their hoofs, rolling their eyes and tossing their heads.
After dinner, when she was helping to wash the dishes, she said, tossing her head: "You got many things for cook.
But my mama, she want Ambrosch for be rich, with many cattle."
There is a mysterious expectation in youth. Therefore it is that we are prone to wander out in the night, without an object.
He would make a famous scoundrel."
Of Dea-of nothing-of everything-of the depths.
The windows of the ground floor made boxes, the pavement of the court the pit, and the balcony the gallery. The Green Box, reared against the wall, was thus in front of a theatre. It was very like the Globe, where they played "Othello," "King Lear," and "The Tempest."
This connoisseur was suddenly fascinated, and had adopted the Laughing Man.
It was composed of watermen, chairmen, coachmen, and bargemen, and sailors, just ashore, spending their wages in feasting and women.
WHERE THE PASSER BY REAPPEARS.
It was large enough to hold, in two rows, ten spectators.
"They are the ancient Trinobantes," he said.
Ursus had been tempted by the bowling green, which had one great recommendation, that it was always fair day there, even in winter.
In a corner behind the Green Box was a stable.
He entered heaven only by the artists' door.
The glory of Gwynplaine had not passed London Bridge.
It was not great enough yet to re echo throughout the city.
He imitated every cry which occurred in the audience-a song, a cry, enough to startle, so exact the imitation, the singer or the crier himself; and now and then he copied the hubbub of the public, and whistled as if there were a crowd of people within him.
"A sailor."
With that exception their success became so great that no mountebank memory could recall its parallel.
A large wooden balcony, roofed over, and supported on posts, on which the rooms of the first story opened, ran round the three fronts of the interior facade of the house, making two right angles.
A certain vagrancy in our spirits impels us to take walks at night, and to saunter under the stars.
He did not come every evening, but when he came he led the public-applause grew into acclamation-success rose not to the roof, for there was none, but to the clouds, for there were plenty of them. Which clouds (seeing that there was no roof) sometimes wept over the masterpiece of Ursus.
The sea is a wall; and if Voltaire-a thing which he very much regretted when it was too late-had not thrown a bridge over to Shakespeare, Shakespeare might still be in England, on the other side of the wall, a captive in insular glory.
Except a few words exchanged now and then with the tavern keeper, they held no communication with any of those who were living, either permanently or temporarily, in the inn; and continued to keep to themselves.
At every performance the yard of the inn, transformed into a pit, was filled with a ragged and enthusiastic audience.
At least not at first.
This was managed much as at present.
They had a great friend in this unknown visitor.
Ursus had made his arrangements with the tavern keeper, Master Nicless, who, owing to his respect for the law, would not admit the wolf without charging him extra.
Curiosity, applause, receipts, crowds, the Laughing Man monopolized everything.
Still it remained local.
The sitting room of the tavern had, as we have seen, an inside door which opened into the court.
Pay and pass in. Under the placard announcing the Laughing Man was a piece of wood, painted white, hung on two nails, on which was written in charcoal in large letters the title of Ursus's grand piece, "Chaos Vanquished."
"Of course I do."
"We must be prepared for the gentry."
A few steps away from it was far enough for him.
"Tom Jim Jack," replied the inn keeper.
"What a pity that he should not be a lord.
In the centre of the balcony, precisely opposite the Green Box, and in a compartment having for entrance a window reaching to the ground, there had been partitioned off a space "for the nobility."
Besides the small fry, the swallowers of swords and the grimace makers, real performances took place on the green.
Nothing was thought of but the Green Box.
There was a circus of women, ringing from morning till night with a magnificent peal of all sorts of instruments-psalteries, drums, rebecks, micamons, timbrels, reeds, dulcimers, gongs, chevrettes, bagpipes, German horns, English eschaqueils, pipes, flutes, and flageolets.
Of what was he thinking?
All these flowed from the street into the theatre, and poured back from the theatre into the tap.
Then he added, "I must not mistake them, for delicacy of taste, for the Atrobates, who people Berkshire, or the Belgians, who inhabited Somersetshire, nor for the Parisians, who founded York."
It was a brave thing to dedicate a cathedral to saint Paul.
Even this comedian of jaws and claws was eclipsed in success.
These were remarkable talents.
CHAPTER three.
saint Peter is the sign of Rome, the city of the dogma; saint Paul that of London, the city of schism.
London, take it all in all, has some good in it.
Then as he redescended the steps at the back of the Green Box, to enter the inn, Master Nicless let fall this profound reflection, so deep as to be unintelligible,--
By the side of the door was constructed off hand, by means of an empty barrel, a box for the money taker, who was sometimes Fibi and sometimes Vinos.
"The money bag grows palpably bigger."
That success was prodigious.
There was a travelling menagerie, where was to be seen a performing tiger, who, lashed by the keeper, snapped at the whip and tried to swallow the lash.
A cathedral is a sign.
The crowd immediately flocked to them, but the compartment for the nobility remained empty.
Between the acts Ursus exhibited his power as an engastrimist, and executed marvels of ventriloquism.
"'Chaos Vanquished' is 'Chaos Victor,'" said Ursus, appropriating half Gwynplaine's success, and taking the wind out of his sails, as they say at sea.
"Do you know that man?"
The empty taverns were shut up, and the lower room in the Tadcaster Inn was dark, except where, in some corner, a solitary candle lighted a last reveller. An indistinct glow gleamed through the window shutters of the half closed tavern, as Gwynplaine, pensive, content, and dreaming, happy in a haze of divine joy, passed backwards and forwards in front of the half open door.
They began their performances.
Otherwise, although established in the tavern, the group in the Green Box had in no way altered their manner of living, and held to their isolated habits.
A loft under the arch of the roof contained the scenes, and on opening a trap door lamps appeared, producing wonders of light.
From this-Gwynplaine had become famous.
The public stood without, in the street, in the fair, forming a semicircle round the stage, exposed to the sun and the showers; an arrangement which made rain less desirable for theatres in those days than now.
The compartment behind belonged to the men, the compartment in front to the women; the compartment in the middle, separating the two sexes, was the stage.
Sometimes he felt regret.
As it dropped it set at liberty three legs on hinges, which supported the panel when let down, and which placed themselves straight on the ground like the legs of a table, and supported it above the earth like a platform.
It now contained two beds.
This exposed the stage, which was thus enlarged by the platform in front.
"What a good turn they did you there, my boy!" said Ursus.
This opening looked for all the world like a "mouth of hell," in the words of the itinerant Puritan preachers, who turned away from it with horror.
So soon as the growth of the child had rendered him fitted for it, he had brought him out on the stage-that is, he had produced him in front of the van.
CHAPTER eight.
The scene of the Green Box represented a landscape painted by Ursus; and as he did not know how to paint, it represented a cavern just as well as a landscape.
The Green Box had but two windows, one at each extremity, and at the back a door with steps to let down.
Often when they appeared side by side on the stage-Ursus in his tightly laced bear's skin, Homo with his wolf's skin fitting still better-no one could tell which was the beast.
It was, perhaps, for some such pious invention that Solon kicked out Thespis.
NOT ONLY HAPPINESS, BUT PROSPERITY.
"Father, you look like a sorcerer!"
Ursus was in everything-in the piece, in the company, in the kitchen, in the orchestra.
In the opposite corner was the kitchen.
"Then I look, perhaps, like what I am."
In Gwynplaine evil thoughts never ripened, and he had therefore no remorse.
A piece of stuff fell over them, and answered the purpose of concealment.
The chariot, of the colour of hope, which carried Ursus, Gwynplaine, and their fortunes, and in front of which Fibi and Vinos trumpeted like figures of Fame, played its part of this grand Bohemian and literary brotherhood.
For all that Thespis has lasted much longer than is generally believed. The travelling theatre is still in existence.
In front, on a ledge fastened to the van, with the window for a door, behind the horses and by the side of an old man who held the reins and directed the team, two gipsy women, dressed as goddesses, sounded their trumpets.
Unknown people had worked upon his face; he, on the other hand, had worked on his mind, and behind this well executed mask he had placed all that he could of thought.
This green colour had succeeded in drawing attention to the carriage, which was known in all the fair grounds as The Green Box.
The eye which could penetrate within this structure and its internal arrangements might have perceived in a corner, fastened to the planks, and immovable on its four wheels, the old hut of Ursus, placed on half pay, allowed to rust, and from thenceforth dispensed the labour of rolling as Ursus was relieved from the labour of drawing it.
"Citizens and townsmen, the Gregorian form of worship, this great progress, is opposed in Italy to the Ambrosial ritual, and in Spain to the Mozarabic ceremonial, and has achieved its triumph over them with difficulty."
These two gipsies, picked up by the philosopher from amongst the vagabondage of cities and suburbs, were ugly and young, and were called, by order of Ursus, the one Phoebe, and the other Venus.
The passers by were immediately struck with wonder.
Phoebe cooked; Venus scrubbed the temple.
This was the old establishment of Ursus, its proportions augmented by success, and improved from a wretched booth into a theatre.
This "fortune" had allowed Ursus, who was the administrator of Gwynplaine's success, to have the chariot of his dreams constructed-that is to say, a caravan large enough to carry a theatre, and to sow science and art in the highways.
He took charge of the horses.
Gwynplaine had, besides, for his work and for his feats of strength, round his neck and over his shoulders, an esclavine of leather.
The caravan was divided into three compartments, partitioned from each other.
The curtain, which we call drop nowadays, was a checked silk, with squares of contrasted colours.
The curiosity of one place exhausted, they passed on to another.
This was Homo. The old coachman who drove the horses was the philosopher himself.
Ursus, it may be remembered, had made Gwynplaine his pupil.
Ursus and Homo took charge of each other.
So also of the will.
Hypochondriacs were cured by the sight of him alone.
The extraordinary face which chance or a special and weird industry had fashioned for him, laughed alone.
With this exception, Gwynplaine's laugh was everlasting.
Thus he rose rapidly in the fair ground and at the cross roads to the very satisfactory renown of a horrible man.
The laugh which he had not placed, himself, on his brow, on his eyelids, on his mouth, he could not remove.
Besides, we must remember that they had in those times means of putting patients to sleep, and of suppressing all suffering; only then it was called magic, while now it is called anaesthesia.
It was Gwynplaine's laugh which created the laughter of others, yet he did not laugh himself.
Gwynplaine had yellow hair.
It was like a head of Medusa, but Medusa hilarious.
Gwynplaine was a gift of Providence to dispel the sadness of man.
The Manichaeans believed the absolute occasionally gives way, and that God Himself sometimes abdicates for a time.
Of what providence?
Its yellow bristles, rather a mane than a head of hair, covered and concealed a lofty brow, evidently made to contain thought.
It was automatic, and the more irresistible because it seemed petrified.
But was it nature?
Gwynplaine was a mountebank.
His articulations usefully displaced and fashioned to bending the wrong way, had received the education of a clown, and could, like the hinges of a door, move backwards and forwards.
Gwynplaine, beautiful in figure, had probably been beautiful in face.
The joyous convulsion of laughter was as a tribute paid; they submitted to it gladly, but almost mechanically.
Gwynplaine had nothing to do with it. The outside did not depend on the interior.
Had she not been assisted?
It laughed and occasioned laughter, but remained pensive.
He was removed from sadness as is pole from pole. Spleen at the one; Gwynplaine at the other.
No such effect had ever before been produced.
Two slits for eyes, a hiatus for a mouth, a snub protuberance with two holes for nostrils, a flattened face, all having for the result an appearance of laughter; it is certain that nature never produces such perfection single handed.
Every one who saw Gwynplaine held his sides; he spoke, and they rolled on the ground.
Let us understand each other; we will explain.
Had Gwynplaine when a child been so worthy of attention that his face had been subjected to transmutation?
Man is not born thus.
Surgical sculpture of the kind could never have succeeded except on a very young child, and consequently on one having little consciousness of what happened to him, and who might easily take a wound for a sickness.
Nature had been prodigal of her kindness to Gwynplaine.
By virtue of the mysterious operation to which Gwynplaine had probably been subjected in his infancy, every part of his face contributed to that rictus; his whole physiognomy led to that result, as a wheel centres in the nave.
But is laughter a synonym of joy?
The man was frightful.
All parody which borders on folly, all irony which borders on wisdom, were condensed and amalgamated in that face.
It only requires to obliterate the root of the nose and to flatten the nostrils.
But he was tall, well made, and agile, and no way deformed, excepting in his face.
Moreover, it happened that on the slightest distraction, or the slightest emotion, the laugh, driven back for a moment, returned like a tide with an impulse which was irresistible in proportion to the force of the adverse emotion.
We do not admit that it can ever be utterly powerless.
One corner of the mouth was raised, in mockery of the human race; the other side, in blasphemy of the gods.
Behind his laugh there was a soul, dreaming, as all our souls dream.
One day the executioner came, and Gwynplaine made him laugh.
It seemed evident that a mysterious and probably occult science, which was to surgery what alchemy was to chemistry, had chiselled his flesh, evidently at a very tender age, and manufactured his countenance with premeditation.
However, his laugh was to Gwynplaine quite a talent.
What a weight for the shoulders of a man-an everlasting laugh!
That infernal head of implacable hilarity he supported on his neck.
Any astonishment which might seize him, any suffering which he might feel, any anger which might take possession of him, any pity which might move him, would only increase this hilarity of his muscles.
It was a terrible effort, and an insupportable tension.
However it may have been, the manipulation of Gwynplaine had succeeded admirably.
A Hottentot profile cannot be changed into a Roman outline, but out of a Grecian nose you may make a Calmuck's.
He could do nothing with it, so he turned it to account.
The whole of existence resembles a letter modified in the postscript.
It had been stamped for ever on his face.
Gwynplaine had been made to order-at least, that was probable.
He was avoided by folks in mourning, because they were compelled to laugh when they saw him, without regard to their decent gravity.
He showed himself on the platform.
They had left the body intact, and retouched only the face.
Besides, when once the novelty of the laugh had passed over, Gwynplaine was intolerable for a woman to see, and impossible to contemplate.
In appropriating him to the profession of mountebank nothing had been neglected.
She had bestowed on him a mouth opening to his ears, ears folding over to his eyes, a shapeless nose to support the spectacles of the grimace maker, and a face that no one could look upon without laughing.
On seeing Gwynplaine, all laughed.
The facial angle was powerful and surprisingly grand.
This led to the presumption that Gwynplaine was rather a creation of art than a work of nature.
An everlasting laugh!
Such perfect completeness is not in nature.
All feeling or thought in the mind of the spectator was suddenly put to flight by the unexpected apparition, and laughter was inevitable.
His hair having probably been dyed with some corrosive preparation, had left it woolly and rough to the touch.
By means of it he gained his living.
Why not?
The operation, whatever it had been, which had deprived his features of harmony, and put all their flesh into disorder, had had no effect on the bony structure of his head.
According to all appearance, industrious manipulators of children had worked upon his face.
One might almost have said that Gwynplaine was that dark, dead mask of ancient comedy adjusted to the body of a living man.
If, in the presence of this mountebank-for he was one-the first impression of gaiety wore off, and the man were observed with attention, traces of art were to be recognized.
All his emotions, whatever they might have been, augmented his strange face of joy, or to speak more correctly, aggravated it.
Besides this face, those who had brought him up had given him the resources of a gymnast and an athlete.
Antique art formerly placed on the outsides of the Greek theatre a joyous brazen face, called comedy.
The death's head retains them.
Women especially shrank from him with horror.
Man can do nothing to create beauty, but everything to produce ugliness.
Is there a providence of demons as well as of God? We put the question without answering it.
Such a face could never have been created by chance; it must have resulted from intention.
For Gwynplaine the postscript was this: by the force of his will, and by concentrating all his attention, and on condition that no emotion should come to distract and turn away the fixedness of his effort, he could manage to suspend the everlasting rictus of his face, and to throw over it a kind of tragic veil, and then the spectator laughed no longer; he shuddered.
Men confronted that model of the ideal sarcasm and exemplification of the irony which each one possesses within him; and the crowd, continually renewed round its fixed laugh, died away with delight before its sepulchral immobility of mirth.
Two convulsions of the face are infectious; laughing and yawning.
"I command you to stay at home this evening." And he walked immediately out of the apartment by another door.
She was going to reply, but found she could not, without accompanying her words with tears, therefore, after the first attempt, she desisted.
Her guardian looked astonished.
"Miss Milner, you shall not leave the house this evening."
She, however, flattered herself that what she had said might be excused as a mistake, the lapse of memory, or some other trifling fault, when he should know the truth.
"It is not the first time, I believe, you have acted contrary to that, Miss Milner," replied mrs Horton, and affected a tenderness of voice, to soften the harshness of her words.
"I mistook-for I had before given my word that I should pass it abroad."
"I do."
Dorriforth read on, and seemed afraid of looking up, lest he should see what he could not have pardoned.
"What could be worse, Madam?" cried Miss Milner; "am not I disappointed of the ball?"
After a few minutes' pause, and some little embarrassment on the part of mrs Horton, at the disappointment she had to encounter from this unexpected dutiful conduct, she asked Miss Milner, "if she would now have any tea?"
But as for this here child, b--." At that moment there came a knock at the door.
Bozzle paused a moment before he replied, and then smiled as he spoke.
"I'm not a taking of her part, b A woman as has a husband as finds her with her wittels regular, and with what's decent and comfortable beside, ought to be contented.
"He cursed and swore as made even me feel bad."
And he knew it all.
Bozzle away from his own home, out on business, with his coat buttoned over his breast, and his best hat in his hand, was aware that he commanded respect,--and he could carry himself accordingly.
"Why not?" Trevelyan could perceive at once that the authority which he had once respected had gone from the man.
As he went about, his eyes were ever cast downwards, and he walked with a quick shuffling gait, and he suspected others, feeling that he himself was suspected.
mrs Bozzle, who well understood that business was business, and that wives were not business, felt no anger at this, and handed her husband his best coat.
I ain't got no evidence, mr Trevelyan.
And all work had ceased with him.
But he had been found with his coat off, and a baby in his arms, and he could not recover himself.
"He's disturbed in his mind,--quite 'orrid," Bozzle said when he got back to his wife.
"Gammon, Bozzle."
I don't believe a bit of his rights."
"I'll tell you what it is, b," exclaimed mrs Bozzle, "it's my belief as he ain't quite right up here;" and mrs Bozzle touched her forehead.
"It ain't to be done, you know," said Bozzle.
"Of course it ain't," said mrs Bozzle.
He looked up for a moment at Bozzle, and then asked him a question.
The well brushed hat was fetched from a cupboard, and it was astonishing to see how easily and how quickly the outer respectability of Bozzle was restored.
"You mean the Colonel, sir.
They don't know what they wants.
"I don't believe it, b"
mrs Bozzle going into the passage, opened it herself, and saw a strange gentleman.
With Hugh Stanbury, Trevelyan had had a direct quarrel.
He have been up all this month, sir."
"But he have, I tell you."
He'll get the child fast enough if he'll go before the court."
Drat 'em all; what is it they wants?
"They haven't met?"
Bozzle, who had stood at the inner door, saw that the gentleman was mr Trevelyan.
It ain't the regular line of business, Bozzle; and there ain't no good to be got, never, by going off the regular line." Whereupon Bozzle scratched his head and again read the letter.
But now, when a demand was made upon Bozzle to violate the sanctity of the clergyman's house, and withdraw the child by force or stratagem, she began to perceive that the palmy days of the Trevelyan affair were over for them, and that it would be wise on her husband's part gradually to back out of the gentleman's employment.
"It ain't to be done anyways;--not in my way of business.
The paternal parent has a right to his infants, no doubt." That was Bozzle's law.
We'd all be shewed up in the papers as that black, that they'd hoot us along the streets.
mrs Bozzle had set a chair for him, but he had declined to sit down.
"Perhaps you could put on your coat, and walk out with me for a few minutes," said Trevelyan.
Then Bozzle came forward and introduced his wife.
"It's love for her as has done it then," said Bozzle, shaking his head.

WHEN a writer calls his work a Romance, it need hardly be observed that he wishes to claim a certain latitude, both as to its fashion and material, which he would not have felt himself entitled to assume had he professed to be writing a Novel.
If he think fit, also, he may so manage his atmospherical medium as to bring out or mellow the lights and deepen and enrich the shadows of the picture.
Many writers lay very great stress upon some definite moral purpose, at which they profess to aim their works.
The reader may perhaps choose to assign an actual locality to the imaginary events of this narrative.
The narrative, it may be, is woven of so humble a texture as to require this advantage, and, at the same time, to render it the more difficult of attainment.
The author has considered it hardly worth his while, therefore, relentlessly to impale the story with its moral as with an iron rod,--or, rather, as by sticking a pin through a butterfly,--thus at once depriving it of life, and causing it to stiffen in an ungainly and unnatural attitude.
A high truth, indeed, fairly, finely, and skilfully wrought out, brightening at every step, and crowning the final development of a work of fiction, may add an artistic glory, but is never any truer, and seldom any more evident, at the last page than at the first.
In good faith, however, he is not sufficiently imaginative to flatter himself with the slightest hope of this kind.
The former-while, as a work of art, it must rigidly subject itself to laws, and while it sins unpardonably so far as it may swerve aside from the truth of the human heart-has fairly a right to present that truth under circumstances, to a great extent, of the writer's own choosing or creation.
He can hardly be said, however, to commit a literary crime even if he disregard this caution.
It is a legend prolonging itself, from an epoch now gray in the distance, down into our own broad daylight, and bringing along with it some of its legendary mist, which the reader, according to his pleasure, may either disregard, or allow it to float almost imperceptibly about the characters and events for the sake of a picturesque effect.
He will be wise, no doubt, to make a very moderate use of the privileges here stated, and, especially, to mingle the Marvelous rather as a slight, delicate, and evanescent flavor, than as any portion of the actual substance of the dish offered to the public.
When romances do really teach anything, or produce any effective operation, it is usually through a far more subtile process than the ostensible one.
If permitted by the historical connection,--which, though slight, was essential to his plan,--the author would very willingly have avoided anything of this nature.
The point of view in which this tale comes under the Romantic definition lies in the attempt to connect a bygone time with the very present that is flitting away from us.
Do not go yet, if you please!
"Cousin," said Phoebe, "did you speak to me just now?"
There is a wonderful insight in Heaven's broad and simple sunshine.
In short, I make pictures out of sunshine; and, not to be too much dazzled with my own trade, I have prevailed with Miss Hepzibah to let me lodge in one of these dusky gables.
"Well, I don't wish to see it any more," observed Phoebe, turning away her eyes.
So wise, as well as antique, was their aspect, as to give color to the idea, not merely that they were the descendants of a time honored race, but that they had existed, in their individual capacity, ever since the House of the Seven Gables was founded, and were somehow mixed up with its destiny.
Here we have the man, sly, subtle, hard, imperious, and, withal, cold as ice.
Now, here is a likeness which I have taken over and over again, and still with no better result.
"I did not know that my cousin Hepzibah's garden was under another person's care."
It would gratify me to have your judgment on this character."
"Do, if you please, my dear child," answered Hepzibah.
But would you like to see a specimen of my productions?"
"Shall I light a lamp, Cousin Hepzibah?" she asked.
The spot acquired a somewhat wilder grace, and yet a very gentle one, from the fact that a pair of robins had built their nest in the pear tree, and were making themselves exceedingly busy and happy in the dark intricacy of its boughs.
There was one other object in the garden which Nature might fairly claim as her inalienable property, in spite of whatever man could do to render it his own.
But there certainly is truth in what you have said.
"That little fowl pays you a high compliment!" said a voice behind Phoebe.
She was indistinctly aware, however, that the gaunt figure of the old gentlewoman was sitting in one of the straight backed chairs, a little withdrawn from the window, the faint gleam of which showed the blanched paleness of her cheek, turned sideways towards a corner.
At that mouth!
He exhibited a daguerreotype miniature in a morocco case.
It has been my custom for more years, child, than you have lived!" While thus dismissing her, the maiden lady stept forward, kissed Phoebe, and pressed her to her heart, which beat against the girl's bosom with a strong, high, and tumultuous swell. How came there to be so much love in this desolate old heart, that it could afford to well over thus abundantly?
Bees, too,--strange to say,--had thought it worth their while to come hither, possibly from the range of hives beside some farm house miles away.
In the remoter parts of the room, however, its walls being so ill adapted to reflect light, there was nearly the same obscurity as before.
How wonderfully responsive to every emotion of the human soul!
"There never was a sweeter one," said Phoebe.
Could it ever smile?
It was evident that the race had degenerated, like many a noble race besides, in consequence of too strict a watchfulness to keep it pure.
Look at that eye!
A crime, indeed!
I have a proposition to make you."
"It will suit my purpose still better to see the original," replied the daguerreotypist coolly.
The remainder of the garden presented a well selected assortment of esculent vegetables, in a praiseworthy state of advancement.
But, stay!
"Maule's well!" answered Phoebe.
"You would have seen other differences had you looked a little longer," said Holgrave, laughing, yet apparently much struck.
The girl ran into the house to get some crumbs of bread, cold potatoes, and other such scraps as were suitable to the accommodating appetite of fowls.
"No, child!" replied Hepzibah.
"But put it on the table in the corner of the passage.
Yet, late as it now was, there still arose a pleasant hum out of one or two of the squash blossoms, in the depths of which these bees were plying their golden labor.
Turning quickly, she was surprised at sight of a young man, who had found access into the garden by a door opening out of another gable than that whence she had emerged.
There is, at least, no flattery in my humble line of art.
For you are a Pyncheon?"
And yet, if you could only see the benign smile of the original!
Would you like to be at its mercy?
It is my Puritan ancestor, who hangs yonder in the parlor.
That last stroke of the hoe has cut off a beanstalk.
"It is nonsense," said Phoebe a little impatiently, "for us to talk about a picture which you have never seen.
His character perplexed the little country girl, as it might a more practised observer; for, while the tone of his conversation had generally been playful, the impression left on her mind was that of gravity, and, except as his youth modified it, almost sternness.
There was a tremor in it, too, that-as all strong feeling is electric-partly communicated itself to Phoebe.
"It is almost too soft and gentle for a man's."
Phoebe saw, however, that their growth must have been checked by a degree of careful labor, bestowed daily and systematically on the garden.
Not surely her cousin Hepzibah's, who had no taste nor spirits for the lady like employment of cultivating flowers, and-with her recluse habits, and tendency to shelter herself within the dismal shadow of the house-would hardly have come forth under the speck of open sky to weed and hoe among the fraternity of beans and squashes.
"If you would permit me," said the artist, looking at Phoebe, "I should like to try whether the daguerreotype can bring out disagreeable traits on a perfectly amiable face.
Returning, she gave a peculiar call, which they seemed to recognize.
Phoebe was on the point of retreating, but turned back, with some hesitation; for she did not exactly comprehend his manner, although, on better observation, its feature seemed rather to be lack of ceremony than any approach to offensive rudeness.
Yet the original wears, to common eyes, a very different expression.
Coming fresh from country air and occupations, you will soon feel the need of some such out of door employment.
You are lucky to be in their good graces so soon!
She concluded that she must have mistaken some other sound for that of the human voice; or else that it was altogether in her fancy.
"Those venerable personages in the coop, too, seem very affably disposed.
The play and slight agitation of the water, in its upward gush, wrought magically with these variegated pebbles, and made a continually shifting apparition of quaint figures, vanishing too suddenly to be definable.
The sun, as you see, tells quite another story, and will not be coaxed out of it, after half a dozen patient attempts on my part.
Most of my likenesses do look unamiable; but the very sufficient reason, I fancy, is, because the originals are so.
But, instead of a response from Hepzibah, she seemed to hear the murmur of an unknown voice.
To be sure, you have found some way of copying the portrait without its black velvet cap and gray beard, and have given him a modern coat and satin cravat, instead of his cloak and band.
They have known me much longer, but never honor me with any familiarity, though hardly a day passes without my bringing them food. Miss Hepzibah, I suppose, will interweave the fact with her other traditions, and set it down that the fowls know you to be a Pyncheon!"
"I can assure you that this is a modern face, and one which you will very probably meet. Now, the remarkable point is, that the original wears, to the world's eye,--and, for aught I know, to his most intimate friends,--an exceedingly pleasant countenance, indicative of benevolence, openness of heart, sunny good humor, and other praiseworthy qualities of that cast.
"Yes," said Holgrave, "I dig, and hoe, and weed, in this black old earth, for the sake of refreshing myself with what little nature and simplicity may be left in it, after men have so long sown and reaped here.
All of them were pure specimens of a breed which had been transmitted down as an heirloom in the Pyncheon family, and were said, while in their prime, to have attained almost the size of turkeys, and, on the score of delicate flesh, to be fit for a prince's table.
"It is certainly very like the old portrait.
It is like a bandage over one's eyes, to come into it.
On returning into Hepzibah's apartment of the house, she found the low studded parlor so dim and dusky that her eyes could not penetrate the interior.
Phoebe merely glanced at it, and gave it back.
In proof of the authenticity of this legendary renown, Hepzibah could have exhibited the shell of a great egg, which an ostrich need hardly have been ashamed of.
It is so much the more unfortunate, as he is a public character of some eminence, and the likeness was intended to be engraved."
You mistake it for some other.
"I don't much like pictures of that sort,--they are so hard and stern; besides dodging away from the eye, and trying to escape altogether.
My eyes are weak; and I can seldom bear the lamplight on them."
He vanished; and Phoebe, lingering a moment, saw a glimmering light, and then the steady beam of a lamp, in a chamber of the gable.
"A daguerreotype likeness, do you mean?" asked Phoebe with less reserve; for, in spite of prejudice, her own youthfulness sprang forward to meet his.
How many aerial voyages might they have made, in quest of honey, or honey laden, betwixt dawn and sunset!
She did not altogether like him.
She set the lighted lamp in the passage, and again entered the parlor. Hepzibah's form, though its sable outline mingled with the dusk, was now less imperfectly visible.
It now contained only Chanticleer, his two wives, and a solitary chicken.
My own sphere does not so much lie among flowers.
She retired to her chamber, but did not soon fall asleep, nor then very profoundly.
They kept themselves alive, unquestionably, and laid now and then an egg, and hatched a chicken; not for any pleasure of their own, but that the world might not absolutely lose what had once been so admirable a breed of fowls.
What an instrument is the human voice!
It was strangely indistinct, however, and less like articulate words than an unshaped sound, such as would be the utterance of feeling and sympathy, rather than of the intellect.
"These matches just glimmer, and go out."
So vague was it, that its impression or echo in Phoebe's mind was that of unreality.
"My name is Phoebe Pyncheon," said the girl, with a manner of some reserve; for she was aware that her new acquaintance could be no other than the daguerreotypist, of whose lawless propensities the old maid had given her a disagreeable idea.
"Ah, but these hens," answered the young man,--"these hens of aristocratic lineage would scorn to understand the vulgar language of a barn yard fowl.
"My dear cousin," asked she, overcoming an indefinable reluctance, "is there not some one in the room with us?"
"Is there nothing dark or sinister anywhere?
"Oh," rejoined the daguerreotypist, "because, like an old lady's cup of tea, it is water bewitched!"
Phoebe wondered whose care and toil it could have been that had planted these vegetables, and kept the soil so clean and orderly.
Thence, swelling over the rim of moss grown stones, the water stole away under the fence, through what we regret to call a gutter, rather than a channel.
He held a hoe in his hand, and, while Phoebe was gone in quest of the crumbs, had begun to busy himself with drawing up fresh earth about the roots of the tomatoes.
"If you begin to love me, I am glad!"
A hop vine, springing from last year's root, was beginning to clamber over it, but would be long in covering the roof with its green mantle.
Fewer words than before, but with the same mysterious music in them! Mellow, melancholy, yet not mournful, the tone seemed to gush up out of the deep well of Hepzibah's heart, all steeped in its profoundest emotion.
"The secret is," said Phoebe, smiling, "that I have learned how to talk with hens and chickens."
She rebelled, as it were, against a certain magnetic element in the artist's nature, which he exercised towards her, possibly without being conscious of it.
"Neither drink nor bathe your face in it!"
Pray go to bed; for I am sure you must need rest.
You can trim and tend them, therefore, as you please; and I will ask only the least trifle of a blossom, now and then, in exchange for all the good, honest kitchen vegetables with which I propose to enrich Miss Hepzibah's table.
So we will be fellow laborers, somewhat on the community system."
"In a moment, cousin!" answered the girl.
And you judge favorably of the face?"
Three of the seven gables either fronted or looked sideways, with a dark solemnity of aspect, down into the garden.
The chicken, hereupon, though almost as venerable in appearance as its mother-possessing, indeed, the whole antiquity of its progenitors in miniature,--mustered vivacity enough to flutter upward and alight on Phoebe's shoulder.
"Be careful not to drink at Maule's well!" said he.
Since you are a friend of my cousin Hepzibah's, you should ask her to show you the picture."
I don't think him improved by your alterations."
Could you not conceive the original to have been guilty of a great crime?"
"I never did, but have a great curiosity to do so.
"I know the face," she replied; "for its stern eye has been following me about all day.
Be that as it might, the hens were now scarcely larger than pigeons, and had a queer, rusty, withered aspect, and a gouty kind of movement, and a sleepy and melancholy tone throughout all the variations of their clucking and cackling.
Summer squashes almost in their golden blossom; cucumbers, now evincing a tendency to spread away from the main stock, and ramble far and wide; two or three rows of string beans and as many more that were about to festoon themselves on poles; tomatoes, occupying a site so sheltered and sunny that the plants were already gigantic, and promised an early and abundant harvest.
The black, rich soil had fed itself with the decay of a long period of time; such as fallen leaves, the petals of flowers, and the stalks and seed-vessels of vagrant and lawless plants, more useful after their death than ever while flaunting in the sun
They were a species of tutelary sprite, or Banshee; although winged and feathered differently from most other guardian angels.
But soon, her senses being very acute, she became conscious of an irregular respiration in an obscure corner of the room. Her physical organization, moreover, being at once delicate and healthy, gave her a perception, operating with almost the effect of a spiritual medium, that somebody was near at hand.
"You have seen that picture, then!" exclaimed the artist, with an expression of much interest.
I prefer to think-and so would Miss Hepzibah-that they recognize the family tone.
Silently, and rather surprised at her own compliance, Phoebe accordingly betook herself to weeding a flower bed, but busied herself still more with cogitations respecting this young man, with whom she so unexpectedly found herself on terms approaching to familiarity.
They are conscious of looking very unamiable, I suppose, and therefore hate to be seen."
My sober occupation, so far as I have any, is with a lighter material.
The girl sat silently for a moment.
The distinguishing mark of the hens was a crest of lamentably scanty growth, in these latter days, but so oddly and wickedly analogous to Hepzibah's turban, that Phoebe-to the poignant distress of her conscience, but inevitably-was led to fancy a general resemblance betwixt these forlorn bipeds and her respectable relative.
"Phoebe, my dear little girl," said Hepzibah, after a moment's pause, "you were up betimes, and have been busy all day.
"Goodnight, cousin," said Phoebe, strangely affected by Hepzibah's manner.
If the original is still in the world, I think he might defy the sun to make him look stern and hard."
There was an odd kind of authority, too, in what he now proceeded to say, rather as if the garden were his own than a place to which he was admitted merely by Hepzibah's courtesy.
But my cousin Hepzibah has another picture,--a miniature.
I will sit in the parlor awhile, and collect my thoughts.
"If agreeable to you," he observed, "it would give me pleasure to turn over these flowers, and those ancient and respectable fowls, to your care.
"As to his character, we need not discuss its points; they have already been settled by a competent tribunal, or one which called itself competent.
It grows somewhat like the lily of the valley, but its height is about three feet.
Originally, the most valuable of these were found in the Spice Islands, or Moluccas, of the Indian Ocean, and were highly prized by the nations of antiquity.
It is very generally cultivated in gardens, and has much improved on its original form.
The long pepper is less aromatic than the black, but its oil is more pungent.
FRIED BREAD FOR BORDERS.
FISH SAUCE.
In Jamaica it flowers about August or September, fading about the end of the year.
It is a bulbous root, and when full grown, its leaves wither in July.
Now wash them well in fresh water, and dress as usual with pepper, vinegar, and oil.
Some also come from saint Helena; but those from Spain are esteemed the best.

Put the udder into a stewpan with sufficient water to cover it; let it stew gently till quite done, when take it out to cool.
FORCEMEAT, or QUENELLES, FOR TURTLE SOUP.
Strip off the shells, chop the eggs into small pieces, not, however, too fine.
Add the wine, and, if necessary, a seasoning of cayenne; when it will be ready to serve.
That portion which passes through the strainer is one of the three ingredients of which French forcemeats are generally composed; but many cooks substitute butter for this, being a less troublesome and more expeditious mode of preparation.
FORCEMEAT FOR BAKED PIKE.
Pound well, and bind with one or two eggs which have been previously beaten and strained.
Simmer for a minute or two, and serve in a tureen.
PICKLED CUCUMBERS.
When they are a good colour, take them off the fire and let them cool; cut them in quarters, take out the seeds and pulp, and put them into cold water.
They are made of iron, and, in that material, can be bought cheap; but as these are not available, for all purposes, we should recommend, as more economical in the end, those made of Wedgwood, although these are considerably more expensive than the former.
Cut the bread into thin slices, place them in a cool oven overnight, and when thoroughly dry and crisp, roll them down into fine crumbs.

Proceed as above, by frying some slices of bread cut in any fanciful shape.
When it is sufficiently thick, take it off, as it should not boil.
Fry them in the same manner as the bread crumbs, in clear boiling lard, or clarified dripping, and drain them until thoroughly crisp before the fire.
When quite crisp, they are ready for use.
Work the whole well together, and the forcemeat will be ready for use.
Boil the syrup once in two or three days for three weeks; strengthen it if required, and let it be quite cold before the cucumbers are put in.
four hundred.
Put some lard, or clarified dripping, into a frying pan; bring it to the boiling point, throw in the crumbs, and fry them very quickly. Directly they are done, lift them out with a slice, and drain them before the fire from all greasy moisture.
MARJORAM.--Although there are several species of marjoram, that which is known as the sweet or knotted marjoram, is the one usually preferred in cookery.
For brown or white ragouts they should be firm, and when the quenelles are used very small, extreme delicacy will be necessary in their preparation.
PESTLE AND MORTAR.--No cookery can be perfectly performed without the aid of the useful instruments shown in the engraving.
When variety is desired, fry some of a pale colour, and others of a darker hue.
The romans indulged in them to a most extravagant degree.
As we have stated before, no one flavour should predominate greatly, and the forcemeat should be of sufficient body to cut with a knife, and yet not dry and heavy.

Any one with the slightest pretensions to refined cookery, must, in this particular, implicitly follow the example of our friends across the Channel.
Boil them before they are put into the soup or other dish they may be intended for.
EPICUREAN SAUCE FOR STEAKS, CHOPS, GRAVIES, o r FISH.
The kind commonly sold, however, is imported from Portugal, Spain, and the Azores.
Let it stand four or five days, boil it all up, and when cold, strain the liquor through a piece of muslin, and store it away in small bottles well sealed.
If the quenelles are not firm enough, add the yolk of another egg, but omit the white, which only makes them hollow and puffy inside.

Great attention must be paid to the directions in the commencement of this recipe, as, if these are not properly carried out, the result will be far from satisfactory.
In a short time, boil up the vinegar again, add pepper and ginger in the above proportion, and instantly cover them up.
If they are not a fine green, change the water again, cover them as before, and make them hot.
Place the jug in a saucepan of boiling water; keep stirring well until it thickens, but do not allow it to boil, or it will curdle. Serve the sauce in a tureen, stir in the brandy, and grate a little nutmeg over the top.
It is a native of Portugal, and when its leaves are used as a seasoning herb, they have an agreeable aromatic flavour.
It is hardier than the orange, and, as one of the citron tribe, was brought into Europe by the Arabians.
If it should be in an unsound state, it must be on no account made use of.
Strain and skim off every particle of fat, and when required for use, thicken with butter and flour, or with a little roux.
It will be well to state, in the beginning of this recipe, that French forcemeat, or quenelles, consist of the blending of three separate processes; namely, panada, udder, and whatever meat you intend using.
The lemon was first cultivated in England in the beginning of the seventeenth century, and is now often to be found in our green houses.
FENNEL SAUCE FOR MACKEREL.
Veal Quenelles.
When the whole is well blended together, mould it into balls, or whatever shape is intended, roll them in flour, and poach in boiling water, to which a little salt should have been added.
[Illustration: THE CUCUMBER.]
Excellent salads may be made of hard eggs, or the remains of salt fish flaked nicely from the bone, by pouring over a little of the above mixture when hot, and allowing it to cool.
PANADA.
Tie them down with bladder, and in a few days they will be fit for use.
Note.--This sauce may be poured hot over salad, and left to get quite cold, when it should be thick, smooth, and somewhat stiff.
FORCEMEAT BALLS FOR FISH SOUPS.
When the three ingredients are properly prepared, pound them altogether in a mortar for some time; for the more quenelles are pounded, the more delicate they are.
The fleshy creeping roots, which form the ginger of commerce, are in a proper state to be dug when the stalks are entirely withered.
Continue in this manner till the border is completed, arranging the sippets a pale and a dark one alternately.
The next day, drain them well for six hours, put them into a jar, pour boiling vinegar over them, and keep them in a warm place.
EGG SAUCE FOR SALT FISH.
Lemon juice may be added at pleasure.
COMMON SALT.--By this we mean salt used for cooking purposes, which is found in great abundance both on land and in the waters of the ocean.
Let them remain for two days, changing the water twice each day, to draw out the salt.
We here give an engraving of a salt mine at Northwich, Cheshire, where both salt mines and brine springs are exceedingly productive, and are believed to have been wrought so far back as during the occupation of Britain by the romans.
CUCUMBER SAUCE, WHITE.
of bread crumbs, two eggs.
Beat the yolks of the other two eggs; add them, with a little flour and salt, to those pounded; mix all well together, and roll into balls.
It is called by old authors the "barren onion," and is used in sauces and pickles, soups and made dishes, and as an accompaniment to chops and steaks.
Warm the butter till it is in a liquid state; well whisk the eggs, and work these up with the pounded lobster meat.
Oysters or anchovies may be added to this forcemeat, and will be found a great improvement.
Continue pounding till the whole is nicely amalgamated.
FORCEMEAT FOR PIKE, CARP, HADDOCK, AND VARIOUS KINDS OF FISH.
If the pie is not to be eaten immediately, omit the herbs and parsley, as these would prevent it from keeping.
FRIED BREAD CRUMBS.
Strain, and bottle off for use.
This sauce or gravy is used for many dishes, and with most people is a general favourite.
[Illustration: BASIL.]
Mushrooms or truffles may be added.
DUTCH SAUCE FOR FISH.
[Illustration: PESTLE AND MORTAR.]
When quite crisp, dip one side of the sippet into the beaten white of an egg mixed with a little flour, and place it on the edge of the dish.
The winter sweet marjoram used for the same purposes, is a native of Greece, and the pot marjoram is another variety brought from Sicily.
Boil for five minutes, mince it very small, and mix it with the other ingredients.
INGREDIENTS.--Cucumbers, salt.
Now beat and strain the eggs, work these up with the other ingredients, and the forcemeat will be ready for use.
GREEN DUTCH SAUCE, or HOLLANDAISE VERTE.
Boiled Calf's Udder for French Forcemeats.
Various dishes are frequently ornamented and garnished with its graceful leaves, and these are sometimes boiled in soups, although it is more usually confined, in English cookery, to the mackerel sauce as here given.
Let this again dry up by stirring over the fire; then add the yolks of two eggs, mix well, put the panada to cool on a clean plate, and use it when required.
In the preparation of this recipe, it would be well to bear in mind that the ingredients are to be well pounded and seasoned, and must be made hard or soft according to the dishes they are intended for.
Tarragon vinegar may be used instead of plain, and, by many, is considered far preferable.
When done, moisten with two teacupfuls of white stock, boil for twenty minutes, and strain the whole through a sieve over the panada in the other stewpan. Place it over the fire, keep constantly stirring, to prevent its burning, and when quite dry, put in a small piece of butter.
Herbert became more unreasonable than ever.
In any event, her second marriage would lead to one disastrous result.
"Did Malcolm give you this?" Randal asked.
Besides, looking to Catherine's interest-and not forgetting how she had suffered-had Randal any right to regard with other than friendly feelings a second marriage, which united her to a man morally and intellectually the superior of her first husband?
Randal's loyalty to Catherine hesitated to decide that serious question against the woman whom he had known, trusted, and admired for so many years.
For a moment the two men looked at each other without speaking. Herbert's wondering eyes accurately reflected his brother's astonishment.
That the Captain would welcome his friend's daughter as affectionately as if she had been his own child, was not to be doubted for a moment.
It drove me out of the house and into the railway.
No more of it now.
We have both seen the same newspaper, of course-and you have been the first to clear the thing up.
In the meantime, after what mrs Presty had confessed, the cruel falsehood which had checked poor Kitty's natural inquiries raised an insuperable obstacle to a meeting between father and child.
Would he be justified in alluding to the report which associated Bennydeck with Catherine?
"Leave that to me," was the one reply which Randal could venture to make at the moment.
No explanation of the cause of this delay followed.
"In all my remembrance of you," he said, "you have never told me a lie.
Randal could deny that he had seen Catherine, with perfect truth-and did deny it in the plainest terms.
The bare doubt that my divorced wife might be the woman was bad enough-but what I wanted to find out was how she had passed off her false pretense on our child.
The first which he happened to take up was addressed to him in mrs Presty's handwriting.
What happier future could await her-especially if she justified Randal's past experience of all that was candid and truthful in her character-than to become his friend's wife?
He would not be able (he wrote) to leave Sydenham for a day or two.
"Gently, Herbert!
But it might, perhaps, be excusable to infer that the marriage had not yet been decided on, and that the Captain's proposals were still waiting for Catherine's reply.
That's it, isn't it?"
"What are you doing here?" he asked.
To perform that promise appeared to be now simply impossible.
"no"
His natural frank nature urged him to undeceive Herbert.
"After what you have told me, why should I suppose anything of the sort?"
It would sooner or later come to Herbert's ears.
Even this apparently simple proceeding required examination in its different bearings, before he could begin his letter.
Written under the modifying influence of these conclusions, his letter contained the few words that follow:
It was for the Captain to confirm what mrs Presty had said of him, if he thought it desirable to touch on the subject in his reply.
Having allowed herself to be entrapped into the deception proposed by her mother, and having thus far persevered in that deception, were the chances in favor of her revealing her true position-especially if she was disposed to encourage Bennydeck's suit?
"I have news for you which I am sure you will be glad to hear.
"I suppose she is as handsome as ever.
If Randal shrank from the prospect which thus presented itself to him, in his relations with his brother, and if his thoughts reverted to Sydney Westerfield, other reasons for apprehension found their way into his mind.
He snatched a newspaper out of his pocket as he spoke-tore it in half-and threw it away.
"Don't be angry; and do pray remember that the Divorce allows you and Catherine to marry again, if you like."
If it had driven me out of mind, I shouldn't have been surprised."
Suspicion overclouded his face as he put the question.
Considerations of delicacy seemed to forbid taking this liberty, even with an intimate friend.
I don't doubt that I am free already to do this; but it will encourage the poor girl, if I can speak with your authority."
"Malcolm meant well, poor fellow," he said, referring to the old servant, "but he made a miserable man of me for all that."
Be the results, however, what they might, Randal could see but one plain course before him now.
Without entering into particulars which may be mercifully dismissed from notice, let me only assure you that I answer for Sydney Westerfield as being worthy of the fatherly interest which you feel in her.
"She's not Catherine, at any rate; I, for one, shall go home with a lighter heart." He took his brother's arm, to return to the other platform.
It was not the newspaper which he had bought at the station.
"Not lately."
His opinion of this correspondent was expressed in prompt action-he threw the letter, unopened, into the waste paper basket.
The devil take the thing, and the people who write in it!"
He had promised to do his best toward persuading Catherine to grant Sydney an interview.
You seem to have forgotten that the woman at Buck's Hotel is described as a Widow.
But that she would receive the same unremitting attention, while he was courting Catherine, which would have been offered to her under other circumstances, was not to be hoped.
Under the exasperating influence of a disappointment for which she was not prepared, it was hard to say what act of imprudence Sydney might not commit.
Shall I say that she may expect an early visit from you, when I see her to morrow?
When will you ask her to let me see Kitty?"
Supposing the report had been true-?"
The next letter was from Bennydeck, written in the kindest terms, but containing no allusion to any contemplated change in his life.
On the afternoon of the next day two letters were delivered to Randal, bearing the Sydenham postmark.
The serious embarrassments that surrounded him were thickening fast.
"You have been to the hotel?" he burst out; "you have seen Catherine?"
If he followed his inclinations, in the near neighborhood of the hotel, who could say what disasters might not ensue, in his brother's present frame of mind?
Your old friend's daughter has abandoned her sinful way of life, and has made sacrifices which prove the sincerity of her repentance.
Have you seen Catherine lately?"
Not satisfied with gossip in private, the greedy public appetite devours gossip in print, and wants more of it than any one editor can supply. Randal picked up the torn newspaper.
"Do you know, Randal, I was almost afraid that Catherine was the woman.
"If Catherine does think of marrying again," he said, "the man will have to reckon first with me. But that is not the point.
If he made the disclosure on their return to the house, he would be only running the same risk of consequences, after an interval of delay; and, if he remained silent, the march of events might, at any moment, lead to the discovery of what he had concealed.
He decided on hastening Sydney's introduction to Bennydeck, and on writing at once to prepare the Captain for that event.
Make the Best of It.
Herbert had been reading a rival journal, devoted to the interests of Society-in which the report of mrs Norman's marriage was repeated, with this difference, that it boldly alluded to Captain Bennydeck by name.
He added Sydney's address in a postscript, and dispatched his letter that evening.
Add to this, that his confidence in Catherine had been rudely shaken.
Herbert was satisfied.
A long distance; I'm dead beat."
Randal wrote to accept the invitation; determining to present himself before the appointed hour, and to question Catherine privately, without giving her the advantage over him of preparing herself for the interview.
After months of separation, he received a visit from Herbert.
I didn't know how fond I was of Sydney till I lost her; I didn't know how fond I was of my wife till I left her." He paused, and put his hand to his fevered head.
The one way is the positive way, when a man who suffers trouble is degraded by it.
These lines set Randal thinking seriously.
"I will do neither the one nor the other.
"Don't be hard on me," he said.
Nothing was known of the Captain's movements there.
"You can't do it."
"You won't write it?
"Let me rest a little," he pleaded, "if I'm not in the way.
I haven't courage enough to do it for myself.
Tell me where my wife is living now?"
Not having heard from Captain Bennydeck for some little time, Randal thought it desirable in Sydney's interests to make inquiries at his club.
He spoke sternly-with his heart aching for his brother all the time. He was right.
He drank the wine greedily.
On the chance of getting the information that he wanted, Randal wrote to the hotel at Sandyseal.
Had her beauty fascinated him?
And yet he spoke roughly; he looked like an angry man brought to bay.
"I seem to frighten you," he said.
No, no; of course you won't forget." He tried to rise, and fell back again into his chair.
Whatever reviving effect it might otherwise have produced on him, it made no change in the threatening gloom of his manner.
And, now, Sydney's taken away from me next.
Try to understand them.
"I feel for you, Herbert," he said, warmly.
He put down the empty glass, taking no notice of his brother's question. "Randal," he said, "you know where Sydney is."
I'm not fit company for you, I know; I'll go when you tell me."
Shake hands, Randal; we have never had any unfriendly words; we mustn't begin now.
Some days since, the yacht had again appeared in the bay.
This alternative in the Captain's plans (terminating the voyage a month earlier than his arrangements had contemplated) puzzled Randal.
Will you give her a message?"
In a man morally weak, calamity (suffered without resisting power) breaks its way through the surface which exhibits a gentleman, and shows the naked nature which claims kindred with our ancestor the savage.
"You distress me, Herbert, more than words can say."
Do you hear that?
"As soon as possible?"
I've been walking-I don't know where.
Listen to Reason.
Miss Westerfield is quite right in separating herself from you.
And you are quite wrong in wishing to go back to her.
Randal admitted it.
I was so happy, Randal, with Catherine and little Kitty."
My mind's in such a state I can't remember it; write it down."
Her letter concluded in these words: "You will only meet one person besides ourselves-your friend, and (since we last met) our friend too.
Was this man-haggard, pallid, shabby, looking at him piteously with bloodshot eyes-the handsome, pleasant, prosperous brother whom he remembered?
"I think a man in my situation is to be pitied-especially by his brother.
Randal refused to let him go at all.
He called at his friend's private residence, only to hear from the servants that they had seen nothing of their master.
The landlord's reply a little surprised him.
"Do you feel better, Herbert?"
"She shall have your message; all that I can do to persuade her shall be done."
He could only point to a seat.
I haven't got my wife; she has thrown me over, and taken my child away from me.
Oh, why did I engage that governess!
"Let me hear what it is first."
"And you won't forget?
And, once again, sit down."
Go back to your chair; fierce looks and clinched fists don't frighten me.
To represent Bennydeck as being "tired of the sea," and as being willing to try, in place of the breezy Channel, the air of a suburb of London, was to make excuses too perfectly futile and absurd to deceive any one who knew the Captain.
"Dear old fellow, I want you to do me a favor.
"And now rest," he said, "and let me put this cushion under your head."
"Give me a glass of wine.
His tone touched Randal to the quick.
When he said his next words he was almost like his old self again.
The poor wretch sank under Randal's firm voice and steady eye.
In the short time that passed before the day of the dinner, distressing circumstances strengthened his resolution.
"Yes-as soon as possible."
"Give me her address.
Her residence at the sea side, helped by the lapse of time, had restored to her personal attractions almost all they had lost under the deteriorating influences of care and grief; and her change of name must have protected her from a discovery of the Divorce which would have shocked a man so sincerely religious as Bennydeck.
There's something perverse about me.
No! I'm not faint.
Give me back Sydney, or knock out my brains.
It eases my head when I rest like this.
Herbert lifted his head, and laid his hand earnestly on his brother's arm.
Alone!
He laid his head wearily on the back of his chair.
In spite of the appearance of innocence which pervaded Catherine's letter, the true motive for breaking off his cruise might be found, as Randal concluded, in Catherine herself.
You don't know what it is to be used to seeing a pretty creature, always nicely dressed, always about the room-thinking so much of you, and so little of herself-and then to be left alone as I am left, out in the dark.
He astonished his brother by a new entreaty-the last imaginable entreaty that Randal expected to hear.
I'm not like you; I'm not accustomed to live alone.
Herbert answered: "It's like being at home again"--and composed himself to rest.
"You will stay here with me; and if I happen to be away, there will be somebody in the house, who is almost as fond of you as I am." He mentioned the name of one of the old servants at Mount Morven, who had attached himself to Randal after the breakup of the family.
The sailing master announced that he had orders to take the vessel back to her port-with no other explanation than that the cruise was over.
I have something to say to her."
and you won't give it?"
I'm alone.
Was his mind wandering into some other train of thought?
Was she aware of the interest that he felt in her? and was it secretly understood and returned?
Captain Bennydeck has got tired of the sea.
I tried it yesterday; it set my brains on fire; I'm feeling that glass I took just now.
Captain Bennydeck had landed, to all appearance in fairly good health; and had left by an early train for London.
After reading one or two of the political articles, he arrived at the columns specially devoted to "Fashionable Intelligence." Caring nothing for that sort of news, he was turning over the pages in search of the literary and dramatic articles, when a name not unfamiliar to him caught his eye.
"You are to understand that Catherine is a widow.
What a perfect gentleman!"
"How nice of you to come so soon!" she began.
"Have you done all this with Catherine's consent?" he asked as he got up from his chair.
"Am I really to understand, mrs Presty, that Catherine-"
Arrived at the station, Randal found that he must wait for the train. While he was walking up and down the platform with a mind doubly distressed by anxiety about his brother and anxiety about Sydney, the train from London came in.
mrs Presty was at home; she was reported to be in the garden of the hotel.
The very question which Randal had promised to ask in his brother's interests!
I say it with pride, a widow of my making!"
You would have seen her pining for the company of other children, and would have had no mercy on her?
Her keen penetration discovered something in his face which checked the gayety of her welcome.
With his own suspicions steadily contradicting him, he arrived at the hotel, obstinately believing that "the charming widow" would prove to be a stranger.
"The charming widow!" Was it possible that this last word referred to Catherine?
I have ship wrecked Herbert as the shortest way of answering inconvenient questions.
He was introduced to mrs Norman, and to mrs Norman's little girl, and we were all charmed with him.
"I should have told the truth."
No one knew on what errand he was bent, when he left the house.
"I should have kept in retirement for the future," he answered, "and not have trusted my child and myself among strangers in hotels."
He stood, looking absently at the passengers leaving the carriage on the opposite side of the platform.
Randal bought it.
"Exactly what I did!
When he and I happened to be left together he naturally wondered, after having seen the beautiful wife, where the lucky husband might be.
The report is premature, my good friend.
If I had told the truth at this hotel, when everybody wanted to know what mrs Norman, that handsome lady, was-what would the consequences have been to Catherine and her little girl?
"Be so good," he said, "as to tell Catherine that I try to make every possible allowance for her, but that I cannot consent to sit at her dinner table, and that I dare not face my poor little niece, after what I have heard."
It was a relief to Randal-in the present state of Catherine's relations toward Bennydeck-to return to London without having seen his friend.
No! no! I have made the best of a miserable situation; I have consulted the tranquillity of a cruelly injured woman and an innocent child-with this inevitable result; I have been obliged to treat your brother like a character in a novel.
That incorrigible old woman treated him with affectionate familiarity in return.
"Your sour face would spoil the best dinner that ever was put on the table.
One moment before you go!
I am put on my defense.
"And would you have seen your child made to suffer as well as yourself?"
"Good by, dear Randal.
The allusion to Bennydeck was too plain to be mistaken.
mrs Presty's audacity was something more than he could understand.
"Sit down," said mrs Presty.
mrs Presty recovered all her audacity.
Having related the circumstances, she suggested that Randal should put himself in Catherine's place, before he ventured on expressing an opinion.
Randal found her comfortably established in a summerhouse, with her knitting in her hands, and a newspaper on her lap.
Will it be of any use if we invite you to the marriage?"
If he had asked you about mr Norman, how would you have answered him?"
Randal looked again at the first words in the paragraph.
mrs Presty smiled significantly.
Very well.
"If this is one of your jokes, ma'am-"
"Say thoroughly worthy of the course forced upon me and my daughter by your brother's infamous conduct-and you will be nearer the mark!"
He read the paragraph in which it appeared.
"That will do, mrs Presty.
Randal decided on leaving her.
"And how did Catherine answer you?" he inquired.
"Yes."
"Not at the hotel, just now."
"Before I consented to answer the child's inquiries, I came to an understanding with her mother.
His prospects of success, in pleading for a favorable reception of his brother's message, were so uncertain that he refrained-in fear of raising hopes which he might not be able to justify-from taking Herbert into his confidence.
Don't be mysterious, my dear.
"Would you have exposed yourself to be humiliated again in the same way?" she asked.
She said: 'I daren't!' After that, I had her mother's authority for telling Kitty that she would never see her father again. She asked directly if her father was dead-"
"Is this woman mad?" he said to himself.
You shall hear how my divorced daughter and my poor little grandchild were treated at Sandyseal, after you left us."
Chapter forty.
"How very complimentary to a poor useless old woman!
"Wait a minute," she answered.
"You don't mean to say that you are going to spoil our pleasant little dinner by bringing bad news!" she added, looking at him suspiciously.
He took leave of mrs Presty with the formality due to a stranger-he merely bowed.
Have you any message for Captain Bennydeck?"
Keep Your Temper.
He's an obstacle in our way, and we have been compelled to get rid of him."
The author only says, 'It's whispered.' How delicate of him!
Your defense is thoroughly worthy of your conduct in all other respects."
I said, 'Will you let Kitty see her father again?'"
The new number of a popular weekly journal had that day been published.
And the Captain of course concluded (after having been introduced to Kitty) that mrs Norman was a widow.
"It depends on you to decide that," Randal replied.
"A very wise decision," she remarked.
"Are you aware, mrs Presty, that my brother-"
If I had set him right, what would have become of my daughter's reputation?
Vessel found bottom upward in the middle of the Atlantic, and everybody on board drowned, of course.
Randal drew back a step.
For the first time mrs Presty became serious.
"Honestly.
Besides, if it isn't true now, it will be true next week.
"I am indeed sorry to spoil your dramatic effect," she said.
Randal passed this over without notice.
As he took his place in the carriage, the newspaper boy appeared at the window as usual.
"Catherine submits to circumstances, like a sensible woman."
"If you are determined to make a serious business of it-if you insist on my justifying myself-you are to be pitied for not possessing a sense of humor, but you shall have your own way.
Randal handed his paper to her, open at the right place.
Randal asked if his friend was then at the hotel.
"Ah, indeed?
"Does she submit to your telling Kitty that her father is dead?"
It is whispered that the lady is to be shortly united to a retired naval officer of Arctic fame; now better known, perhaps, as one of our leading philanthropists."
"Where is he?"
Worse stories have been printed; I do assure you, worse stories have been printed."
And you would have condemned your poor little daughter to solitude?
Out with it!"
"There is my news," he said.
"Where he is every day, about this time-out driving with Catherine and Kitty."
"Oh, don't talk of your brother!
She advanced to meet him, all smiles and amiability.
He wondered to see the lance leaning against the tree, the shield on the ground, and Don Quixote in armour and dejected, with the saddest and most melancholy face that sadness itself could produce; and going up to him he said, "Be not so cast down, good man, for you have not fallen into the hands of any inhuman Busiris, but into Roque Guinart's, which are more merciful than cruel."
Give me my horse and arms, and wait for me here; I will go in quest of this knight, and dead or alive I will make him keep his word plighted to so great beauty."
At this instant one or two of those squires who were posted as sentinels on the roads, to watch who came along them and report what passed to their chief, came up and said, "Senor, there is a great troop of people not far off coming along the road to Barcelona."
"What are you talking about, man?" said one of the bystanders; "I have got them, and they are not worth three reals."
One of the squires observed in his mixture of Gascon and Catalan, "This captain of ours would make a better friar than highwayman; if he wants to be so generous another time, let it be with his own property and not ours."
Who is touching me and untrussing me?"
And if you have any desire to shorten the journey and put yourself easily in the way of salvation, come with me, and I will show you how to become a knight errant, a calling wherein so many hardships and mishaps are encountered that if they be taken as penances they will lodge you in heaven in a trice."
"It will not do to leave it to thy courtesy, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "for thou art hard of heart and, though a clown, tender of flesh;" and at the same time he strove and struggled to untie him.
And now the squires despatched to make the prize came up, bringing with them two gentlemen on horseback, two pilgrims on foot, and a coach full of women with some six servants on foot and on horseback in attendance on them, and a couple of muleteers whom the gentlemen had with them.
"So then," said Roque Guinart, "we have got here nine hundred crowns and sixty reals; my soldiers must number some sixty; see how much there falls to each, for I am a bad arithmetician." As soon as the robbers heard this they raised a shout of "Long life to Roque Guinart, in spite of the lladres that seek his ruin!"
He saw that his squires (for so they call those who follow that trade) were about to rifle Sancho Panza, but he ordered them to desist and was at once obeyed, so the girdle escaped.
He trembled with fear and made for another tree, where the very same thing happened to him, and he fell a shouting, calling upon Don Quixote to come and protect him.
Don Quixote did so, and asked him what had happened to him, and what he was afraid of.
"Well then, away with you all," said Roque, "and bring them here to me at once without letting one of them escape."
Upon this Sancho remarked, "From what I have seen here, justice is such a good thing that there is no doing without it, even among the thieves themselves."
You see the treatment is a trifle fanciful.
The Singer then drops a second flower into the lap of the child in the middle, and goes away, and this ends the first part of the game.

In they go.
Around her, with their backs to her, stand six maids in a ring, with joined hands.

But I did once have the luck to hear and see The Lady played in entirety-the children had been granted leave to play "just one more game" before bed time, and of course they chose the longest and played it without missing a syllable.

They will indicate these changes perhaps by colored ribbons, or by any flower in its season, or by imagining themselves first in green and then in rose, which is really the best way of all.
The dancers once more encircle their weeping comrade, and now they are gowned in white and pink.
You may not come into our orchard, singer, In case you set free the Emperor's Daughter Who pines apart to follow her heart That's flown a thousand leagues over the water, Singer, singer, Wandering singer, O my honey sweet singer!
They have the end of the game to themselves.)
The Emperor's Daughter is not yet released, for the key of her tower is understood to be still in the keeping of the dancing children.
But this is a fallacy.
On this adventure he was about the business of young Robin Rue.
(Once more The Singer plays and The Ladies dance; but one by one they fall asleep to the drowsy music, and then The Singer steps into the ring and unlocks the Tower and kisses The Emperor's Daughter.
THE LADIES
The third part of the game is seldom played.
(The Ladies, in gowns of white and rose color, stand around The Emperor's Daughter, weeping in her Tower.
THE WANDERING SINGER
It seems to me more and more as I live longer, that most poetry and most literature and particularly the literature of the past is discordant with the vastness and variety, the reserves and resources and recuperations of life as we live it to day.
We killed her....
CHAPTER THE TWELFTH
And she was owned, she was mastered, she was forced into concealment.
"She kept her faith with you.
We never planned to meet and when we met----.
I give myself, and if I can I will give you, to the destruction of jealousy and of the forms and shelters and instruments of jealousy, both in my own self and in the thought and laws and usage of the world.
For it became necessary for me to see Justin in order that we should stamp out the whispers against her that followed her death.
"It's so damned silly.
But it is manifest I still live, I live and work and feel and share beauty....
We range wider, last longer, and escape more and more from intensity towards understanding.
Through all her life this brave and fine and beautiful being was for the most part of her possibilities, wasted in a splendid setting, magnificently wasted if you will, but wasted.
Nevertheless she was not all my life, nor the form of all my life.
"You were wrong in all that," I said.
Life was made impossible for her and she was forced to die, according to the fate of all untimely things.
And already this astounding blow begins to take its place among other events, as a thing strange and terrible indeed, but related to all the strangeness and mystery of life, part of the universal mysteries of despair and futility and death that have troubled my consciousness since childhood.
The blood stained organized jealousies of religious intolerance, the delusions of nationality and cult and race, that black hatred which simple people and young people and common people cherish against all that is not in the likeness of themselves, cease to be the undisputed ruling forces of our collective life.
And perhaps in this story I have said enough for you to understand why Mary has identified herself with something world-wide, has added to herself a symbolical value, and why it is I find in the whole crowded spectacle of mankind, a quality that is also hers, a sense of fine things entangled and stifled and unable to free themselves from the ancient limiting jealousies which law and custom embody.
"Stratton," he said, "we two---- We killed her.
I became grotesquely anxious to assure him that, indeed, she and I had been, as they say, innocent throughout our last day together.
What I had from her, and what she was, is but a mere intimation of all that she and I might have made of each other and the world.
I look out upon the neat French garden that I have watched the summer round, and before me is the pile of manuscript that has grown here, the story of my friendship and love for Mary and of its tragic end, and of all the changes of my beliefs and purposes that have arisen out of that.
"We tore her to pieces," he repeated.
She who was so abundantly living, who could love like a burst of sunshine and give herself as God gives the world, is she here at all in this pile of industrious inexpert writing?
How we must simplify!
For a time the death of Mary obscured her life for me, but now her living presence is more in my mind again.
In Mary, it seems to me, I found both womanhood and fellowship, I found what many have dreamt of, love and friendship freely given, and I could do nothing but clutch at her to make her my possession.
I begin to see that it is the reality of her existence and not the accidents of her end that matter most.
She was destroyed, not merely by the unconsidered, undisciplined passions of her husband and her lover, but by the vast tradition that sustains and enforces the subjugation of her sex.
But now it doesn't seem to matter very much.
Indeed there was nothing."
We tore her to pieces between us...."
There had been talk on the part of clerks and possible witnesses.
If we had been brother and sister----.
Life is so much fuller than any book can be.
What alternative was there for her?
It gives, at most, certain acute points, certain salient aspects.
We had come to our parting, we had done our business with an affectation of emotional aloofness, and then suddenly he gripped me by the arm.
I will not be content with that compromise of jealousies which is the established life of humanity to day.
"I suppose," he said, "I ought to be glad of that.
THE ARRAIGNMENT OF JEALOUSY
She might have become one of those poor neuters, an independent woman....
Even Mary, of whom I have labored to tell you, seems not so much expressed as hidden beneath these corrected sheets.
What alternative is there for any woman?
I had meant it to be the story of my life, but how little of my life is in it!
For I know that a growing multitude of men and women outwear the ancient ways.
One gets angry-like an animal."
It signifies less that she should have flung out of life when it seemed that her living could only have meant disaster to herself and to all she loved, than that all her life should have been hampered and restricted.
She might perhaps have kept her freedom by some ill paid work and at the price of every other impulse in her swift and eager nature.
He had just viewed the malice of men and the misery of society under a new aspect-incomplete aspects, which unfortunately only exhibited one side of the truth, the fate of woman as summed up in Fantine, and public authority as personified in Javert.
We all have in our past a delightful garret.
To teach Cosette to read, and to let her play, this constituted nearly the whole of Jean Valjean's existence.
The novelty of the earth and of life counts for something here.
It was this good woman who had lighted the fire in the stove, and prepared everything on the evening of their arrival.
This idea had ended in teaching a child to read.
At times she became serious and stared at her little black gown.
At the mysterious moment when their hands touched, they were welded together. When these two souls perceived each other, they recognized each other as necessary to each other, and embraced each other closely.
It was this old woman, ornamented with the name of the principal lodger, and in reality intrusted with the functions of portress, who had let him the lodging on Christmas eve.
When he saw Cosette, when he had taken possession of her, carried her off, and delivered her, he felt his heart moved within him.
The poor child, who was used to being beaten, did not know the meaning of this, and ran away in confusion.
And then he talked of her mother, and he made her pray.
Cosette laughed, chattered, and sang from daybreak.
He was that child's stay, and she was his prop.
Thanks to him, she could walk through life; thanks to her, he could continue in virtue.
He protected her, and she strengthened him.
Cosette was no longer in rags; she was in mourning.
She called him father, and knew no other name for him.
The best of us are not exempt from egotistical thoughts.
He saw a whole future stretching out before him, illuminated by Cosette as by a charming light.
He had represented himself to her as a gentleman of means who had been ruined by Spanish bonds, who was coming there to live with his little daughter.
Nothing is so charming as the coloring reflection of happiness on a garret.
Jean Valjean had never loved anything; for twenty five years he had been alone in the world.
Cosette, on her side, had also, unknown to herself, become another being, poor little thing!
Poor old man, with a perfectly new heart!
Destiny suddenly united and wedded with its irresistible power these two uprooted existences, differing in age, alike in sorrow.
Nature, a difference of fifty years, had set a profound gulf between Jean Valjean and Cosette; destiny filled in this gulf.
The entrance of that man into the destiny of that child had been the advent of God.
It is a sad thing to say, and we have already intimated it, that, at eight years of age, her heart was cold.
The Bishop had caused the dawn of virtue to rise on his horizon; Cosette caused the dawn of love to rise.
The early days passed in this dazzled state.
Jean Valjean had undertaken to teach her to read.
Children have their morning song as well as birds.
Life, henceforth, appeared to him to be full of interest; men seemed to him good and just; he no longer reproached any one in thought; he saw no reason why he should not live to be a very old man, now that this child loved him.
The man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor; she thought Jean Valjean handsome, just as she thought the hovel pretty.
Good thoughts have their abysses as well as evil ones.
Moreover, Jean Valjean had chosen his refuge well.
He approached the bed, where she lay sleeping, and trembled with joy.
The chamber with a dressing room, which he occupied with Cosette, was the one whose window opened on the boulevard.
One, in fact, completed the other.
She had loved the dog, and he had died, after which nothing and nobody would have anything to do with her.
It sometimes happened that Jean Valjean clasped her tiny red hand, all cracked with chilblains, and kissed it.
Only, as he was five and fifty, and Cosette eight years of age, all that might have been love in the whole course of his life flowed together into a sort of ineffable light.
CHAPTER three-TWO MISFORTUNES MAKE ONE PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE
To meet was to find each other.
Some new thing had come into his soul.
She was so little when her mother left her, that she no longer remembered her.
And in truth, the mysterious impression produced on Cosette in the depths of the forest of Chelles by the hand of Jean Valjean grasping hers in the dark was not an illusion, but a reality.
Sometimes, as he made the child spell, he remembered that it was with the idea of doing evil that he had learned to read in prison.
There he seemed perfectly secure.
Thus, from the very first day, all her sentient and thinking powers loved this kind man.
This being the only window in the house, no neighbors' glances were to be feared from across the way or at the side.
Like all children, who resemble young shoots of the vine, which cling to everything, she had tried to love; she had not succeeded.
The first story contained, as we have said, numerous chambers and several attics, only one of which was occupied by the old woman who took charge of Jean Valjean's housekeeping; all the rest was uninhabited.
She had emerged from misery, and she was entering into life.
At times, he reflected with a sort of joy that she would be ugly.
Three big wolves got abreast of the horses, and the horses went crazy.
Pavel reached the brow of the hill, but only two sledges followed him down the other side.
At his sale we bought Peter's wheelbarrow and some of his harness.
The firelight flickered on the hewn logs that supported the thatch overhead.
The young man cursed him and held her tighter.
He only knew that he had first borrowed two hundred dollars, then another hundred, then fifty-that each time a bonus was added to the principal, and the debt grew faster than any crop he planted.
The ruddy windows guided us-the light from the kitchen stove, for there was no lamp burning.
Pavel called for something and struggled up on his elbow.
The road was clear and white, and the groom's three blacks went like the wind.
Each gust, as it bore down, rattled the panes, and swelled off like the others.
From our bench we could see what a hollow case his body was.
At last he was shut off by a coughing fit which fairly choked him.
It was only necessary to be calm and to guide them carefully.
When Pavel and peter were young men, living at home in Russia, they were asked to be groomsmen for a friend who was to marry the belle of another village.
I could not take my eyes off the man in the bed.
Pavel was very bad, he said, and wanted to talk to mr Shimerda and his daughter; he had come to fetch them.
Pavel gave peter the reins and stepped carefully into the back of the sledge.
Now his middle horse was being almost dragged by the other two.
His shirt was hanging open, and his emaciated chest, covered with yellow bristle, rose and fell horribly.
"There are only three sledges left," he whispered.
Pavel sat still and watched his horses.
The shrieks that followed made everybody sober.
Without a word peter got up and lit his lantern.
I did not see him do it, but this I know: after all his furniture and his cook stove and pots and pans had been hauled off by the purchasers, when his house was stripped and bare, he sat down on the floor with his clasp knife and ate all the melons that he had put away for winter.
At length, as they breasted a long hill, peter rose cautiously and looked back.
Presently, in one of those sobbing intervals between the blasts, the coyotes tuned up with their whining howl; one, two, three, then all together-to tell us that winter was coming.
On the way home, when we were lying in the straw, under the jolting and rattling Antonia told me as much of the story as she could.
She asked peter to wait a moment, and when she came back from the kitchen she brought a bag of sandwiches and doughnuts for us.
He grew more and more excited, and kept pointing all around his bed, as if there were things there and he wanted mr Shimerda to see them.
One afternoon Antonia and her father came over to our house to get buttermilk, and lingered, as they usually did, until the sun was low.
But the groom's movement had given Pavel an idea.
We burrowed down in the straw and curled up close together, watching the angry red die out of the west and the stars begin to shine in the clear, windy sky.
WHILE the autumn color was growing pale on the grass and cornfields, things went badly with our friends the Russians.
Perhaps Russian peter, come from farther away than any of us, had brought from his land, too, some such belief.
Antonia's father uncovered one of his long bony legs and rubbed it rhythmically.
His eyes followed peter about the room with a contemptuous, unfriendly expression.
The sharp smell of spirits went through the room.
The wolves were bad that winter, and every one knew it, yet when they heard the first wolf cry, the drivers were not much alarmed.
The wolves were coming together. There was no moon, but the starlight was clear on the snow.
"Yes."
mr Shimerda and peter were on the front seat; Antonia and I sat in the straw behind and ate our lunch as we bumped along.
peter told his troubles to mr Shimerda: he was unable to meet a note which fell due on the first of November; had to pay an exorbitant bonus on renewing it, and to give a mortgage on his pigs and horses and even his milk cow.
peter shuffled to his feet, caught up the tea kettle and mixed him some hot water and whiskey.
At midnight the parents of the bride said good bye to her and blessed her.
What she did not tell me then, she told later; we talked of nothing else for days afterward.
Up there the stars grew magnificently bright.
The little house on the hillside was so much the color of the night that we could not see it as we came up the draw.
Tony whispered to me that he was afraid Pavel would never get well.
"It's awful, what he says!"
During the auction he went about with his head down, and never lifted his eyes. He seemed not to care about anything.
Soon after peter renewed his note, Pavel strained himself lifting timbers for a new barn, and fell over among the shavings with such a gush of blood from the lungs that his fellow workmen thought he would die on the spot. They hauled him home and put him into his bed, and there he lay, very ill indeed.
His spine and shoulder blades stood out like the bones under the hide of a dead steer left in the fields.
Quickly it was covered with bright red spots-I thought I had never seen any blood so bright.
The dinner lasted all afternoon; then it became a supper and continued far into the night.
"They still come?" he asked peter.
Pavel died a few days after he unburdened his mind to mr Shimerda, and was buried in the Norwegian graveyard.
Pavel tried to drag her away. In the struggle, the groom rose.
The coyotes broke out again; yap, yap, yap-then the high whine.
They tried to jump over each other, got tangled up in the harness, and overturned the sledge.
Misfortune seemed to settle like an evil bird on the roof of the log house, and to flap its wings there, warning human beings away.
We entered softly.
Presently Pavel began to talk to mr Shimerda, scarcely above a whisper. He was telling a long story, and as he went on, Antonia took my hand under the table and held it tight.
Just as they were leaving, Russian peter drove up.
Wherever they went, the story followed them.
He began to cough.
He lay patiently fighting for breath, like a child with croup.
mr Shimerda caught him by the shoulders, but could hardly hold him in bed.
The loss of his two friends had a depressing effect upon old mr Shimerda. When he was out hunting, he used to go into the empty log house and sit there, brooding.
We sat and watched the long bowed back under the blue sheet, scarcely daring to breathe.
Pavel made a rasping sound when he breathed, and he kept moaning.
"And the wolves?" Pavel asked.
They had too much good food and drink inside them.
The Black Hawk money lender who held mortgages on Peter's live stock was there, and he bought in the sale notes at about fifty cents on the dollar.
The wind shook the doors and windows impatiently, then swept on again, singing through the big spaces.
My plan must have seemed very foolish to her, but she was often large minded about humoring the desires of other people.
He saw his father's sledge overturned, with his mother and sisters.
They made me think of defeated armies, retreating; or of ghosts who were trying desperately to get in for shelter, and then went moaning on.
We lay still and did not talk.
Though we had come from such different parts of the world, in both of us there was some dusky superstition that those shining groups have their influence upon what is and what is not to be.
The Russians had such bad luck that people were afraid of them and liked to put them out of mind.
The drivers stood up and lashed their horses.
He was sitting on the floor by the kitchen stove.
It was in the dead of winter and the groom's party went over to the wedding in sledges.
This cabin was his hermitage until the winter snows penned him in his cave.
peter kept sighing and groaning.
The sick man raged and shook his fist.
All the drivers were more or less the worse for merry making, and the groom was absorbed in his bride.
Beside a frozen pond something happened to the other sledge; peter saw it plainly.
It took them five years to save money enough to come to America. They worked in Chicago, Des Moines, Fort Wayne, but they were always unfortunate.
peter, crouching in the front seat, saw nothing.
He sprang up as if he meant to jump, but the girl shrieked and held him back.
The wolves ran like streaks of shadow; they looked no bigger than dogs, but there were hundreds of them.
Pavel and peter drove into the village alone, and they had been alone ever since.
For Antonia and me, the story of the wedding party was never at an end.
That sharp backbone must have hurt him when he lay on it.
"It's wolves, Jimmy," Antonia whispered.
He called to the groom that they must lighten-and pointed to the bride.
Enough for all of us."
Pavel knocked him over the side of the sledge and threw the girl after him.
peter sold off everything, and left the country-went to be cook in a railway construction camp where gangs of Russians were employed.
Presently the groom screamed.
Another driver lost control.
Gradually, relief came to all of us.
The first howls were taken up and echoed and with quickening repetitions.
peter could give no very clear account of his transactions with Cutter.
Whatever it was, the worst was over. mr Shimerda signed to us that Pavel was asleep.
After the sun sank, a cold wind sprang up and moaned over the prairie.
A black drove came up over the hill behind the wedding party.
The black ground shadows were already crowding over the heap in the road, and one horse ran out across the fields, his harness hanging to him, wolves at his heels.
He sprang in beside her, and Pavel and peter (our Pavel and peter!) took the front seat.
After the ceremony at the church, the party went to a dinner given by the parents of the bride.
Pavel snatched the cup and drank, then made peter give him the bottle and slipped it under his pillow, grinning disagreeably, as if he had outwitted some one.
They were within a few miles of their village now.
"Twenty, thirty-enough."
There was much dancing and drinking.
They went away to strange towns, but when people learned where they came from, they were always asked if they knew the two men who had fed the bride to the wolves.
Now everything was plastered with mortgages.
The groom had the best team and his sledge was lightest-all the others carried from six to a dozen people.
In the same spirit Adamnan voluntarily undertook a journey to York, where Aldfrid (a Prince educated in Ireland, and whose "Itinerary" of Ireland we still have) now reigned. The Abbot of Iona succeeded in his humane mission, and crossing over to his native land, he restored sixty of the captives to their homes and kindred.
York was its capital, and the seat of its ecclesiastical primacy, where, at the time we speak of, the illustrious Wilfrid was maintaining, with a wilful and unscrupulous king, a struggle not unlike that which Becket maintained with Henry the second.
The cause of the battle was the pretension of the petty Prince of Ulidia, which comprised little more than the present county of Down, to be recognised as Prince of all Ulster.
King Donald was accompanied by his Bard, who described to him, as they came in sight, the several standards of Congal's host, and who served under them.
The Saxons had now been for four centuries in Britain, the older inhabitants of which-Celts like the Gauls and Irish-they had cruelly harassed, just as the Milesian Irish oppressed their Belgic predecessors, and as the Normans, in turn, will be found oppressing both Celt and Saxon in England and Ireland.
In every recorded instance the power of the clergy had been omnipotent in politics for above a century.
The all powerful intercessor in this case was Saint Moling, of the royal house of Leinster, and Bishop of Fernamore (now Ferns).
Congal had recruited numerous bands of Saxons, Britons, Picts and Argyle Scots, who poured into the Larbours of Down for months, and were marshalled on the banks of the Lagan, to sustain his cause.
saint Aidan, the Apostle of Northumbria, had refused the late Egfrid's father absolution, on one occasion, until he solemnly promised to restore their freedom to certain captives of this description.
The last armed struggle of Druidism, and the only invasion of Ireland by the Anglo Saxons, are also events of the civil history of the seventh century.
The Munster King, and many of the chieftain class shared the common lot.
It is pretty clear also that the last rally of Druidism against Christianity took place behind his banner, on the plain of Moira.
The abolition, he contended, should not be simply a suspension, but final and for ever.
Like the two kings of Sparta they reigned jointly, dividing between them the labours and cares of State.
In the early part of his reign Finnacta seems not to have been disposed to collect this invidious tax by force; but, yielding to other motives, he afterwards took a different view of his duty, and marched into Leinster to compel its payment. Here the holy Prelate of Ferns met him, and related a Vision in which he had been instructed to demand the abolition of the impost.
Lastly, the royal brothers fell themselves victims to the epidemic, which so sadly signalizes their reign.
To heighten the awful sense of inevitable doom, an eclipse of the sun occurred concurrently with the appearance of the pestilence on the first Sunday in May.
The only conflicts that occurred on Irish soil with a Pictish or an Anglo Saxon force-if we except those who formed a contingent of Congal's army at Moira-occurred in the time of the hospitable Finnacta.
The Saxons of Kent and the Southern Kingdoms generally were converted by missionaries from France or Rome, or native preachers of the first or second Christian generation; those of Northumbria recognise as their Apostles saint Aidan and saint Cuthbert, two Fathers from Iona.
Abolished it was, and though its re-enactment was often attempted, the authority of Saint Moling's solemn settlement, prevented it from being re enforced for any length of time, except as a political or military infliction.
The tribute was, at this period, enormous; fifteen thousand head of cattle annually.
The barren rock, about three miles in length, was covered with monastic buildings, and its cemetery was already adorned with the tombs of saints and kings.
As leading to the mention of other interesting events, we must set this inroad clearly before the reader.
The Kingdom of Northumbria, as the name implies, embraced nearly all the country from the Humber to the Pictish border.
Now every missionary that ever went out from Iona, had taught that to reduce Christians to slavery was wholly inconsistent with a belief in the doctrines of the Gospel.
Nothing could be more natural than such an assembly in such a place, at such a period.
The piety of an after age saw in the retribution which overtook Egfrid the following year, when he was slain by the Picts and Scots, the judgment of Heaven, avenging the unprovoked wrongs of the Irish. His Scottish conquerors, returning good for evil, carried his body to Iona, where it was interred with all due honour.
He learned, too, that there were in Northumbria several Christian captives, carried off in Beort's expedition and probably sold into slavery.
Adamnan regarded the fate of Egfrid, we may be sure, in the light of a judgment on him for his misdeeds, as Bede and British Christians very generally did.
Finnacta fell in battle in the twentieth year of his long and glorious reign; and is commemorated as a saint in the Irish calendar.
Britain had been divided by the Saxon leaders into eight separate kingdoms, the people and princes of several of which were converted to Christianity in the fifth, sixth, and seventh century, though some of them did not receive the Gospel before the beginning of the eighth.
So slow and patient is the process by which Christianity infuses itself into the social life of a converted people!
CHAPTER six.
Five successors of Columbkill slept in peace around their holy Founder, and a sixth, equal in learning and sanctity to any who preceded him, received the remains of King Egfrid from the hands of his conquerors.
This Prince, Egfrid by name, was constantly engaged in wars with his Saxon cotemporaries, or the Picts and Scots.
As I turned him over I began to feel proud of him, to have a kind of respect for his age and size.
He did not say anything for a minute, but scratched his head and turned the snake over with his boot.
He seemed like the ancient, eldest Evil. Certainly his kind have left horrible unconscious memories in all warm blooded life.
Antonia came after me, crying, "O Jimmy, he not bite you?
Subsequent experiences with rattlesnakes taught me that my first encounter was fortunate in circumstance.
Otto winked at me.
Her exultation was contagious.
"Up at the dog town," I answered laconically.
I was walking backward, in a crouching position, when I heard Antonia scream.
When we dragged him down into the draw, Dude sprang off to the end of his tether and shivered all over-would n't let us come near him.
He was as thick as my leg, and looked as if millstones could n't crush the disgusting vitality out of him.
I offered to take her on the pony, and she got up behind me.
She went on in this strain until I began to think that I had longed for this opportunity, and had hailed it with joy.
She liked me better from that time on, and she never took a supercilious air with me again.
"Look, Tony, that's his poison," I said.
We might get some puppies, or owl eggs, or snake skins.
I walked away and turned my back.
We decided that Antonia should ride Dude home, and I would walk.
When I turned he was lying in long loose waves, like a letter "W." He twitched and began to coil slowly.
He is all over Jimmy's boots. I scream for him to run, but he just hit and hit that snake like he was crazy."
I did n't run because I did n't think of it-if my back had been against a stone wall I could n't have felt more cornered.
Cautiously we went back to the snake; he was still groping with his tail, turning up his ugly belly in the light.
The dogs were out, as usual, dozens of them, sitting up on their hind legs over the doors of their houses.
That snake hung on our corral fence for several days; some of the neighbors came to see it and agreed that it was the biggest rattler ever killed in those parts.
I ran up and drove at his head with my spade, struck him fairly across the neck, and in a minute he was all about my feet in wavy loops.
You might have told me there was a snake behind me!" I said petulantly.
As we approached, they barked, shook their tails at us, and scurried underground.
I had been adequately armed by Russian peter; the snake was old and lazy; and I had Antonia beside me, to appreciate and admire.
Did he fight hard?"
Antonia called him to come quick and look.
I followed with the spade over my shoulder, dragging my snake.
A faint, fetid smell came from him, and a thread of green liquid oozed from his crushed head.
I had killed a big snake-I was now a big fellow.
Before the mouths of the holes were little patches of sand and gravel, scratched up, we supposed, from a long way below the surface.
I struck now from hate.
If the red grass were full of rattlers, I was equal to them all. Nevertheless, I stole furtive glances behind me now and then to see that no avenging mate, older and bigger than my quarry, was racing up from the rear.
This was enough for Antonia.
I suppose I looked as sick as I felt.
There had been another black frost the night before, and the air was clear and heady as wine.
The dog town was spread out over perhaps ten acres.
"We'd been up to Russian Peter's, to borrow a spade for Ambrosch."
The holes were several yards apart, and were disposed with a good deal of regularity, almost as if the town had been laid out in streets and avenues.
As we rode away with the spade, Antonia suggested that we stop at the prairie dog town and dig into one of the holes.
I felt seasick.
Now we take that snake home and show everybody.
Otto Fuchs was the first one we met.
I saw his coils tighten-now he would spring, spring his length, I remembered.
"Gosh!
Antonia broke in: "He fight something awful!
Within a week all the blooming roads had been despoiled-hundreds of miles of yellow sunflowers had been transformed into brown, rattling, burry stalks.
"It was just luck you had a tool," he said cautiously.
It was on one of these gravel beds that I met my adventure.
Antonia, barefooted as she was, ran up behind me.
Even after I had pounded his ugly head flat, his body kept on coiling and winding, doubling and falling back on itself.
She was four years older than I, to be sure, and had seen more of the world; but I was a boy and she was a girl, and I resented her protecting manner.
I explained to Antonia how this meant that he was twenty four years old, that he must have been there when white men first came, left on from buffalo and Indian times.
During a busy period of three months, the emperor tried every method, except the most effectual means of indifference and contempt, to reconcile this theological quarrel.
In a chamber of the inn, before he had wiped the dust from his shoes, john of Antioch gave audience to Candidian, the Imperial minister; who related his ineffectual efforts to prevent or to annul the hasty violence of the Egyptian.
Ephesus, the city of the Virgin, was defiled with rage and clamor, with sedition and blood; the rival synods darted anathemas and excommunications from their spiritual engines; and the court of Theodosius was perplexed by the adverse and contradictory narratives of the Syrian and Egyptian factions.
Such honors might incite the faithful to combat and die under the banners of the saint; and he soon prompted, or accepted, the sacrifice of a virgin, who professed the religion of the Greeks, and cultivated the friendship of Orestes.
The toleration, and even the privileges of the Jews, who had multiplied to the number of forty thousand, were secured by the laws of the Caesars and Ptolemies, and a long prescription of seven hundred years since the foundation of Alexandria.
Candidian, in the emperor's name, requested a delay of four days; the profane magistrate was driven with outrage and insult from the assembly of the saints.
But the Orientals refused to yield, and the Catholics, proud of their numbers and of their Latin allies, rejected all terms of union or toleration.
At these blasphemous sounds, the pillars of the sanctuary were shaken.
The troops, under the command of Candidian, advanced to the assault; the outguards were routed and put to the sword, but the place was impregnable: the besiegers retired; their retreat was pursued by a vigorous sally; they lost their horses, and many of their soldiers were dangerously wounded with clubs and stones.
Perhaps he might plead the insolence of their prosperity, and their deadly hatred of the Christians, whose blood they had recently shed in a malicious or accidental tumult.
The patience of the meek Theodosius was provoked; and he dissolved in anger this episcopal tumult, which at the distance of thirteen centuries assumes the venerable aspect of the third oecumenical council.
The unsuccessful competitors of Nestorius indulged their pious or personal resentment, the Byzantine clergy was secretly displeased with the intrusion of a stranger: whatever is superstitious or absurd, might claim the protection of the monks; and the people were interested in the glory of their virgin patroness.
On either side of the Hellespont his episcopal vigor imposed a rigid formulary of faith and discipline; a chronological error concerning the festival of Easter was punished as an offence against the church and state.
But the Vatican received with open arms the messengers of Egypt.
He attempted to remove or intimidate the leaders by a common sentence, of acquittal or condemnation; he invested his representatives at Ephesus with ample power and military force; he summoned from either party eight chosen deputies to a free and candid conference in the neighborhood of the capital, far from the contagion of popular frenzy.
After the short and troubled reign of Sisinnius, bishop of Constantinople, the factions of the clergy and people were appeased by the choice of the emperor, who, on this occasion, consulted the voice of fame, and invited the merit of a stranger.
Nestorius, who depended on the near approach of his Eastern friends, persisted, like his predecessor Chrysostom, to disclaim the jurisdiction, and to disobey the summons, of his enemies: they hastened his trial, and his accuser presided in the seat of judgment.
Sixty eight bishops, twenty two of metropolitan rank, defended his cause by a modest and temperate protest: they were excluded from the councils of their brethren.
When the memory of Chrysostom was restored and consecrated, the nephew of Theophilus, at the head of a dying faction, still maintained the justice of his sentence; nor was it till after a tedious delay and an obstinate resistance, that he yielded to the consent of the Catholic world.
Return to your provinces, and may your private virtues repair the mischief and scandal of your meeting." They returned to their provinces; but the same passions which had distracted the synod of Ephesus were diffused over the Eastern world.
His providence will discern and punish the guilty.
Unarmed and unprepared, the Jews were incapable of resistance; their houses of prayer were levelled with the ground, and the episcopal warrior, after rewarding his troops with the plunder of their goods, expelled from the city the remnant of the unbelieving nation.
From the East, more especially from Antioch, he obtained the ambiguous counsels of toleration and silence, which were addressed to both parties while they favored the cause of Nestorius.
The interdiction of their religious worship appeared in his eyes a just and meritorious act; and he confiscated their holy vessels, without apprehending the guilt of sacrilege.
The prize was not unworthy of his ambition.
On the fifth day, the triumph was clouded by the arrival and indignation of the Eastern bishops.
"Give me, O Caesar!" he exclaimed, "give me the earth purged of heretics, and I will give you in exchange the kingdom of heaven.
At a distance from the court, and at the head of an immense capital, the patriarch, as he was now styled, of Alexandria had gradually usurped the state and authority of a civil magistrate.
Such crimes would have deserved the animadversion of the magistrate; but in this promiscuous outrage, the innocent were confounded with the guilty, and Alexandria was impoverished by the loss of a wealthy and industrious colony.
The whole of this momentous transaction was crowded into the compass of a summer's day: the bishops delivered their separate opinions; but the uniformity of style reveals the influence or the hand of a master, who has been accused of corrupting the public evidence of their acts and subscriptions.
The worthy friend of Athanasius, the worthy antagonist of Julian, he bravely wrestled with the Arians and Polytheists, and though he affected the rigor of geometrical demonstration, his commentaries revealed the literal and allegorical sense of the Scriptures.
The son of a learned grammarian, he was skilled in all the sciences of Greece; eloquence, erudition, and philosophy, conspicuous in the volumes of Apollinaris, were humbly devoted to the service of religion.
In the age of religious freedom, which was determined by the council of Nice, the dignity of Christ was measured by private judgment according to the indefinite rule of Scripture, or reason, or tradition.
But when his pure and proper divinity had been established on the ruins of Arianism, the faith of the Catholics trembled on the edge of a precipice where it was impossible to recede, dangerous to stand, dreadful to fall and the manifold inconveniences of their creed were aggravated by the sublime character of their theology.
Her judgment at length inclined in their favor; the heresy of Apollinaris was condemned, and the separate congregations of his disciples were proscribed by the Imperial laws.
The death of Theophilus expanded and realized the hopes of his nephew.
On all sides, it was confessed, that the mode of their coexistence could neither be represented by our ideas, nor expressed by our language.
It was alleged, that when Jesus was nailed to the cross, he was endowed with a miraculous apathy of mind and body, which rendered him insensible of his apparent sufferings. It was affirmed, that these momentary, though real, pangs would be abundantly repaid by the temporal reign of a thousand years reserved for the Messiah in his kingdom of the new Jerusalem.
Under the tuition of the abbot Serapion, he applied himself to ecclesiastical studies, with such indefatigable ardor, that in the course of one sleepless night, he has perused the four Gospels, the Catholic Epistles, and the Epistle to the romans.
He taught that the Godhead was united or mingled with the body of a man; and that the Logos, the eternal wisdom, supplied in the flesh the place and office of a human soul.
In the beginning of the fifth century, the unity of the two natures was the prevailing doctrine of the church.
A mystery, which had long floated in the looseness of popular belief, was defined by his perverse diligence in a technical form; and he first proclaimed the memorable words, "One incarnate nature of Christ," which are still reechoed with hostile clamors in the churches of Asia, Egypt, and Aethiopia.
In the house of his uncle, the archbishop Theophilus, he imbibed the orthodox lessons of zeal and dominion, and five years of his youth were profitably spent in the adjacent monasteries of Nitria.
To purge themselves from the guilt or reproach of damnable error, they disavowed their consequences, explained their principles, excused their indiscretions, and unanimously pronounced the sounds of concord and faith.
He acquiesced in the old distinction of the Greek philosophers between the rational and sensitive soul of man; that he might reserve the Logos for intellectual functions, and employ the subordinate human principle in the meaner actions of animal life.
A similar union is not inconsistent with a much higher, or even with the highest, degree of mental faculties; and the incarnation of an aeon or archangel, the most perfect of created spirits, does not involve any positive contradiction or absurdity.
With the approbation of his uncle, he assumed the office, and acquired the fame, of a popular preacher.
With the moderate Docetes, he revered Mary as the spiritual, rather than as the carnal, mother of Christ, whose body either came from heaven, impassible and incorruptible, or was absorbed, and as it were transformed, into the essence of the Deity.
As soon as they beheld the twilight of sense and heresy, they started, measured back their steps, and were again involved in the gloom of impenetrable orthodoxy.
Yet a secret and incurable discord was cherished, between those who were most apprehensive of confounding, and those who were most fearful of separating, the divinity, and the humanity, of Christ. Impelled by religious frenzy, they fled with adverse haste from the error which they mutually deemed most destructive of truth and salvation.
The system of Apollinaris was strenuously encountered by the Asiatic and Syrian divines whose schools are honored by the names of Basil, Gregory and Chrysostom, and tainted by those of Diodorus, Theodore, and Nestorius.
I was but a private soldier, and if I happened to look to see if I could find out anything, "Eyes right, guide center," was the order.
Officers could not curb the men to keep in line.
Martin.
The boys were in clover.
SHILOH
Should you desire to find out more about the battle, I refer you to history.
w h rushed forward and grabbed his horse by the bridle, telling him at the same time to surrender.
I remember a man by the name of Smith stepping deliberately out of the ranks and shooting his finger off to keep out of the fight; of another poor fellow who was accidentally shot and killed by the discharge of another person's gun, and of others suddenly taken sick with colic.
Flushed with their victories at Fort Henry and Fort Donelson and the capture of Nashville, and the whole State of Tennessee having fallen into their hands, victory was again to perch upon their banners, for Buell's army, by forced marches, had come to Grant's assistance at the eleventh hour.
I got on him again, when all of a sudden he lifted his head, pricked up his ears, began to champ his bit, gave a little squeal, got a little faster, and finally into a gallop and then a run.
If blood makes speed, I do not suppose he had a drop of any kind in him.
He had a propensity to take every hog path he came to.
Gunboats and transports were busily crossing Buell's army all of Sunday night.
Sidney Johnson killed, General Gladden killed, and a host of generals and other brave men killed, and the whole Yankee army in full retreat.
Our regiment was the advance guard on Saturday evening, and did a little skirmishing; but General Gladden's brigade passed us and assumed a position in our immediate front.
He said to us, "Give 'em goss, boys. That's right, my brave First Tennessee.
They retreat in wild confusion.
We could hear the shout of the charge and the incessant roar of the guns, the rattle of the musketry, and knew that the contending forces were engaged in a breast to breast struggle.
His pistol had missed its aim.
About noon a courier dashed up and ordered us to go forward and support General Bragg's center.
He seemed to be in deep meditation.
The air was full of balls and deadly missiles. The litter corps was carrying off the dying and wounded.
The mule was loath to take to the water.
It all seemed to me a dream; I seemed to be in a sort of haze, when siz, siz, siz, the minnie balls from the Yankee line began to whistle around our ears, and I thought of the Irishman when he said, "Sure enough, those fellows are shooting bullets!"
One incident I recollect very well.
But they didn't.
I do not know what it was, but I heard Gladden say, "Tell General Bragg that I have as keen a scent for Yankees as General Chalmers has."
This was Sunday.
He was no Baptist, and did not believe in immersion, and had his views about crossing streams, but the rope began to tighten, the mule to squeal out his protestations against such villainous proceedings.
When in the very midst of our victory, here comes an order to halt. What! halt after today's victory?
The rope, however, was stronger than the mule's "no," and he was finally prevailed upon by the strength of the rope to cross the creek.
The harvest was great and the laborers were not few.
I had been feeling mean all the morning as if I had stolen a sheep, but when the order to charge was given, I got happy.
The fact was kept from the troops.
Our regiment was the advance outpost, and we saw the skirmish line of the Federals advancing and then their main line and then their artillery.
He was wise in his own conceit.
I do not pretend to tell of what command distinguished itself; of heroes; of blood and wounds; of shrieks and groans; of brilliant charges; of cannon captured, etc
We were jubilant; we were triumphant.
He was not a fast mule, and I soon found out that he thought he knew as much as I did.
I soon found out that he had caught sight of the relief on the road, and was afraid to shoot.
We marched plumb into the Yankee lines, with their flags flying.
By this time our command had re-formed, and charged the blazing crest.
I halted him, and told him to go down to the main picket on the road and pass, but he seemed so smiling that I thought he knew me, or had a good joke to tell me.
I was on the skirmish line.
We were ordered forward to the attack.
The crest occupied by the Yankees was belching loud with fire and smoke, and the Rebels were falling like leaves of autumn in a hurricane. The leaden hail storm swept them off the field.
It was said to be buckeye whisky.
Finally says I, "Let's play quits.
From Chattanooga, Bragg's army went to Murfreesboro.
Our advanced outpost was established at Lavergne.
The ball missed its aim.
General Cheatham came up and advanced.
I was afraid to halloo to the relief, and you may be sure I was in a bad fix.
His pistol was leveled, and I was ordered to march.
I saw either victory or death written on his face.
I was on picket at the time the advance was made by Rosecrans.
I did not fall back, but continued to load and shoot, until a fragment of a shell struck me on the arm, and then a minnie ball passed through the same paralyzing my arm, and wounded and disabled me.
But they continued to advance upon us, we firing and retreating slowly.
I looked at it pretty close, and I said "Great God!" for I could see his heart throb, and the respiration of his lungs. I was filled with wonder and horror at the sight.
At the time mentioned, I was standing about two hundred yards off the road, the main body of the pickets being on the Nashville and Murfreesboro turnpike, and commanded by Lieutenant Hardy Murfree, of the Rutherford Rifles.
ROBBING A DEAD YANKEE
I quickly made up my mind.
I said, "O, O, I'm wounded," and at the same time I grabbed my arm.
I had orders to allow no one to pass.
Our pickets had run in and reported a night attack.
We had several pretty sharp brushes with them that day.
There I was, a prisoner sure, and no mistake about it.
But I could not bear the thought of wearing dead men's shoes.
But here they were-the Yankees-a battle had to be fought. We were ordered forward.
Our army stopped at Murfreesboro.
I was perfectly willing to let the spy go on his way rejoicing-for such he was-but he wanted to capture a Rebel.
I took hold of the foot and raised it up and made one trial at the boot to get it off.
They couldn't tell our own men from Yankees.
I am a videt; you know the responsibility resting on me.
He divined my motive, and fired.
This I do know to be a fact.
We ran forward, expecting that our men would recognize us, but they opened fire upon us.
I think you are a soldier; you look like a gentleman.
Is it a bargain?"
Says he, "I would not trust a Secesh on his word, oath, or bond.
The next day, the Yankees were found out to be advancing.
The spectacle was grand.
They fell back and re-formed.
From time to time different regiments were sent forward to do picket duty.
He was stone dead, but I dropped that foot quick.
I dropped the gun.
I called Lieutenant Colonel Frierson's attention to the Yankees, and he remarked, "Well, I don't know whether they are Yankees or not, but if they are, they will come out of there mighty quick."
The Federal army was concentrating at Nashville.
March, I say."
I do not know to what regiment he belonged, but I remember of first noticing that his left arm was entirely gone.
Soon they came in sight of our picket.
Major Allen, of the Twenty seventh Tennessee Regiment, took the saddle and bridle, and gave me the blanket.
There was no rest for the weary.
In passing over the battlefield, I came across a dead Yankee colonel. He had on the finest clothes I ever saw, a red sash and fine sword. I particularly noticed his boots.
We were right upon the Yankee line on the Wilkerson turnpike.
I happened to look up, and the colonel had his eyes wide open, and seemed to be looking at me.
It was my first and last attempt to rob a dead Yankee.
You go your way, and leave me here.
Captain james, of Cheatham's staff, was sent forward and killed in his own yard.
General Cheatham, all the time, was calling on the men to go forward, saying, "Come on, boys, and follow me."
john Barleycorn was general in chief.
He was walking along, when all at once he dropped down and died without a struggle or a groan. I could tell of hundreds of such incidents of the battlefield, but tell only this one, because I remember it so distinctly.
He put spurs to his horse, but I pulled down on him, and almost tore the fore shoulder of his horse entirely off, but I did not capture the spy, though I captured the horse, bridle and saddle.
The Yankees marched over the hill out of sight.
We remained several months, but soon we were on the tramp again.
As I went back to the field hospital, I overtook another man walking along.
I remember that they had to cross an open field in our front, and we were lying behind a fence, and as they advanced, we kept up firing, and would run them back every time, until they brought up a regiment that whooped, and yelled, and charged our skirmish line, and then we fell back again.
The breast and sleeve of his coat had been torn away, and I could see the frazzled end of his shirt sleeve, which appeared to be sucked into the wound.
They couldn't see straight.
The Yankee picket lines were not a half mile off.
It was an order from General Leonidas Polk to allow the bearer to pass.
The ground was literally covered with blue coats dead; and, if I remember correctly, there were eighty dead horses.
MURFREESBORO
BATTLE OF MURFREESBORO
Our generals, and colonels, and captains, had kissed john a little too often.
It was Christmas.
I thought it had been torn from my shoulder.
And I had made up my mind to think likewise.
We came from Knoxville to Chattanooga, and seemed destined to make a permanent stay here.
I read it, and looked up to hand it back to him, when I discovered that he had a pistol cocked and leveled in my face, and says he, "Drop that gun; you are my prisoner." I saw there was no use in fooling about it.
My gun was at my feet, and one step would get it.
A universal cry was raised, "You are firing on your own men." "Cease firing, cease firing," I hallooed; in fact, the whole skirmish line hallooed, and kept on telling them that they were Yankees, and to shoot; but the order was to cease firing, you are firing on your own men.
His face was as white as a sheet.
In fact, no one was expected to pass at this point, but while standing at my post, a horseman rode up behind me.
We kept falling back and firing all day, and were relieved by another regiment about dark.
They persuaded eloquently.
We were inured to privations and hardships; had been upon every march, in every battle, in every skirmish, in every advance, in every retreat, in every victory, in every defeat.
After remaining a good long time at Jonesboro, the news came that we were going to flank Atlanta.
I was walking along rather thoughtlessly and carelessly, when one inch more and I would have disappeared also.
But I was determined to find him, so I kept on hallooing and he answering.
Yank says, "What you doing, Johnny?"
Johnny says, "We are flanking."
The army had been passing a given point, and Jim was sitting quietly on the fence looking at the soldiers.
We walked over this floating bridge, and soon found ourselves on the Tennessee side of Tennessee river.
The soldiers were in good spirits, but it was the spirit of innocence and peace, not war and victory.
But how to get him out was the unsolved problem.
There was no tree or house to be seen; and then again the voice seemed to answer from under the ground, in a hollow, sepulchral tone, but I could not tell where he was.
I was simply one of hundreds of thousands in the same fix.
The tale is the same that every soldier would tell, except Jim Whitler.
The third day it was reported that the Yankees had taken position on the Murfreesboro pike.
A flank means "a go around."
We arrived and remained at Tuscumbia several days, awaiting the laying of the pontoons across the Tennessee river at Florence, Alabama, and then we all crossed over.
While at Tuscumbia, john Branch and I saw a nice sweet potato patch, that looked very tempting to a hungry Rebel.
He stayed with the company two days.
ADVANCE INTO TENNESSEE
How every pulse did beat and leap, and how every heart did throb with emotions of joy, which seemed nearly akin to heaven, when we received the glad intelligence of our onward march toward the land of promise, and of our loved ones.
Going back to camp, I procured a light, and after whooping and hallooing for a long time, I heard another groan, this time much louder than before.
The cold November winds coming off the mountains of the northwest were blowing right in our faces, and nearly cutting us in two.
He didn't see anything to run from, but the other soldiers began to run, and Jim run, too.
A regiment was sent to the attack.
Reader, you should have seen how that old railroad did flop over, and how the darkies did sweat, and how the perfume did fill the atmosphere.
On our way up there, the Yankee cavalry followed us to see how we were getting along with the flanking business.
We flanked it.
I went to the place where the voice appeared to come out of the earth.
Jim had not learned the word "halt!" and just kept on running.
The voice appeared to be overhead.
When we would get to a stream, the pontoons would be thrown across, and Hood's army would cross.
We marched from Decatur to Florence.
The old place looked natural like, only it seemed to have a sort of graveyard loneliness about it.
Hood's army was taking up every able bodied man and conscripting him into the army.
I could not imagine what had become of him.
We were walking along, he a little in the rear, when he suddenly disappeared.
Jim tried to beg off, but all entreaty was in vain. He wanted to go by home and tell his wife and children good bye, and to get his clothes.
He loaded and fired the second time, when they were ordered to retreat.
When we arrived at Dalton, we had a desire to see how the old place looked; not that we cared anything about it, but we just wanted to take a last farewell look at the old place.
On leaving Dalton, after a day's march, we had stopped for the night. Our guns were stacked, and I started off with a comrade to get some wood to cook supper with.
But we always flanked these little affairs.
They persuaded effectually-those feelers did.
TUSCUMBIA
We jumped over the fence, and commenced grabbling for the sweet potatoes.
A MAN IN THE WELL
It was no go.
Jim was soon in line, and was tramping to the music of the march.
It took us four months in the first instance, and but little longer than as many days in the second, to get back to Dalton, our starting point.
We looked all around, and thought that the coast was clear.
Yank says, "Bully for you!"
I looked everywhere.
WE CAPTURE DALTON
We saw the United States flag flying from the ramparts, and thought that Yank would probably be asleep or catching lice, or maybe engaged in a game of seven up.
Jim had dodged about, and had escaped being conscripted until "Hood's raid," he called it.
We broke and run like quarter horses, and the guard pulled down on us just as we jumped the fence.
I called, and called, but could get no answer.
We had pontoons made for the purpose of crossing streams.
It was Jim's regiment.
He didn't know B from a bull's foot in the spelling book.
The country looked like it did at first. Citizens came out, and seemed glad to see us, and would divide their onions, garlic, and leek with us.
We marched the black rascals out.
They said that Sherman had told them not to come out of that block house, any how.
But there were some Yankee soldiers in a block house at Ringgold Gap, who thought they would act big.
Here the pontoon bridges were nicely and beautifully stretched across the river.
"And nightly we pitch our moving tent A day's march nearer home."
The regiment was ordered to fire.
The earth seemed to have opened and swallowed him.
We passed all those glorious battlefields, that have been made classic in history, frequently coming across the skull of some poor fellow sitting on top of a stump, grinning a ghastly smile; also the bones of horses along the road, and fences burned and destroyed, and occasionally the charred remains of a once fine dwelling house.
He walked up and says, "Hello, boys!"
I deny that for the last six months I have been using mr Snelling's home as if it were a boarding house.
But that is not the only society the world contains.
"You want someone who can look after you; and you could not, by any chance, have chosen a person who will look after you better than I shall."
"Her love."
Which is just as well.
I have drawn up a list of all the people who ought to give us a present, and I shall tell them what they ought to give-it won't be my fault if I don't get it.
The members of the family looked at one another.
I did not want any unpleasantness; and I am quite sure there would have been unpleasantness had I demurred.
The Snellings have an aunt who lives in an out of the way hole at the other end of nowhere.
I have given Mary Ann two or three trifles, and I said so.
There was William Henry, john Frank, Ferdinand Augustus, and Stephen Arthur.
Still I noticed that the ring fitted her perfectly, and I could not but wonder if she had tried it on before.
But that was no reason why, the Monday week following, four of her brothers should have called on me on their way to the office, when I was scarcely out of bed, and actually breakfasting, and assailed me in the way in which they did.
The girl is fretting, but you don't seem to notice it.
The alteration which has taken place in their demeanour since my accident with Mary Ann is, therefore, all the more amazing.
WHITING AND MARY ANN.
It might just as well be some one else's wedding, so unimportant is the part which I am set to play in it.
To begin with she had six brothers and five sisters, and she is the eldest of the batch, and there's not one of the brothers whom I feel drawn to.
I was not pressed for time.
And as you don't appear to know what is the proper thing to do in a case of this kind, and don't understand that the ring ought to be bought straight away, we've bought it for you."
I had been with Mary Ann to church, and had seen her home, and had had a little supper, and it was after supper that it happened.
Her face was close to mine, or my face was close to hers, and then her lips came into contact with my lips, or my lips came into contact with her lips-I don't know which it was-and then at that moment her mother came into the room, and she said, "mr
And, of course, I had my expectations, and she had hers.
Nor did I take any steps in that direction during the whole of that week.
It is true that I have dropped in to dinner now and then, or to spend the evening, or for an afternoon call, or for an hour or two in the morning; but that has been simply and solely because the Snelling family have evinced so marked a desire for my society.
She will keep them at bay.
Each of them twice my size and all of them frightfully ignorant and wholly regardless of the sensitive little points of those with whom they came in contact.
Mary Ann beamed at me, and she said, "You dear old man!" Presently she continued:
I shall do nothing of the kind."
The accident in question occurred upon the Sunday evening.
Of course there are some people with whom you can't be perfectly plain, but I shall be as plain as I can; there's a way and a manner of doing that kind of thing.
I had never had one, but I saw clearly that in that way the money would go twice as far.
But Mary Ann does not seem to think that that matters, so why should I? Her youngest sister, Clara Louisa, has quite gratuitously informed me that she has had them by her for some considerable time, and that, not to put too fine a point on it, they were originally designed for another individual altogether-a mr Pilbeam.
But why, on that account, they should pity me, I altogether fail to understand.
'A bird in the hand is worth two in a bush'--and it will be something to have by us."
After dinner I took advantage of an opportunity which offered to thank Mary Ann for her action in the matter, because, of course, I had no wish to spend my honeymoon in a place of which I knew nothing, to oblige an aunt of whom I knew still less.
The matter was talked about at dinner.
It was plain that together we should manage most comfortably.
Only I found it difficult to explain, and when I did explain she would not understand.
I did not go and purchase the engagement ring the first thing on the Monday morning, I own it.
It is true that there are times when I am a little disposed to wish that she were not quite so good a manager; now and then every man likes to call his soul his own.
But she went on with the most perfect fluency.
Her head dropped on my shoulder, and she kissed me under the chin, observing, "You dear old Sam." The moments when I am alone with Mary Ann are alleviations for those more frequent moments when I am not alone with Mary Ann.
It is most delightful.
My belief is that they have been induced to spend at least twice as much as they intended, and that they resent it.
It turned out that she had a little money of her own; about a hundred and thirty pounds a year.
A handsome price it was.
At least I drew up a list of people who ought to meet the occasion, and I tried in more than one instance to drop a hint of what, as I felt, they ought to meet it with.
They produced the ring, and told me what I had to pay for it.
I endeavoured to explain to her that I felt sure of it; but I fear that my explanation was a little stumbling.
He has given us free passes all the way to the end of our journey, and all the way back again; and coupons for free board and lodging at the hotel.
The mere suggestion is absurd.
Besides, I was turning things over in my mind.
It is certain that we have a large collection of really valuable property about the house-the wedding presents to Mary Ann.
All, apparently, that is left for me to do, is to pay for everything.
Nothing of the kind.
She has a knack of getting people to do what she wishes and to give her what she wants, which is a little short of miraculous.
I endeavoured to.
I do not know what he meant, and would rather not attempt to imagine.
There she owns a cottage, or it may be a pigstye for all I know.
It's a wedding present.
Mary Ann was silent for some time; then she quietly remarked:
It is to take place on Tuesday fortnight.
It is true that they are a trifle large for me, and that I shall never be able to keep them on my feet except when I am sitting still.
"I shall make papa give me five hundred pounds, at least.
Whiting, may I ask what is the meaning of this?" I said it meant nothing-nothing!
I was persuaded that somebody besides that cousin got a profit out of Mary Ann's engagement ring.
"That's it; on your account.
Besides which we can always sell the coupons and railway passes which we don't use.
"Look here, Whiting, how about Mary Ann's ring?
I told her exactly what my income was; and the source from which it came, and all about it.
"Do you know that in marrying me you are doing the best thing for yourself that you ever did in all your life?"
I found that as a woman of business she was beyond all my expectations.
Such an assurance was most satisfactory.
It is from her action in that matter that my suspicion springs.
There is no circumlocution about them. They go straight at what they want; and were scarcely inside my door before they blurted out the purport of their coming.
"Don't trouble yourselves to discuss Aunt Brady's proposal.
But, after a very considerable pause, her mother said, with quite unusual mildness, "Very well, my dear. Then, it's settled."
p s--The cards are out for the wedding.
So that, as Mary Ann says, our honeymoon need cost us practically nothing.
mr
I have no intention of being presented with an endless collection of duplicates, or a lot of useless rubbish which I don't know what to do with.
Her father is a most remarkable person, to say the least.
From a cousin of ours who's in that line."
Absolutely nothing!
A second cousin of Mary Ann's is in the Cook's Tours line.
On the other hand, she is well qualified to protect me from the rest of the family.
I never saw people like the Snellings for possessing relatives in all sorts of "lines." No matter what you want, or do not want, and never will want, they are sure to have some relative who has dealt in it, his or her whole life long.
As it is, unless I am mistaken, some of the rending will be on our side.
But I am bound to admit that so far my success has been as nothing compared with hers.
I will take care that my relations do their duty.
It was an admirable plan.
Her manner was not at all the sort of thing I care for. The result is that I am engaged to Mary Ann Snelling without being conscious of having entertained any intention of the kind.
It was Frederick Augustus; if the thing is possible he is, if anything, more direct even than the rest of his family.
And they know it!
Delightfully, in fact.
She drew up a plan on which we were to lay it out.
There were no signs of faltering about her flow of language.
Hers has been prodigious.
Someone sniggered.
We had a long confidential chat on matters of business.
I did not mean to kiss her; it was a pure accident.
If she had been like me they would have rent us limb from limb.
This observation was followed by perfect silence.
"We have all been giving Mary Ann presents, and I suppose you, mr Whiting, have been giving her something too." That was what mrs Macpherson said to me only the other day.
And it is all the result of an accident.
Certainly not.
I gasped-positively gasped.
Not that I have a word to say against Mary Ann, except that I never knew a girl with quite so many relations.
When she heard of my engagement with Mary Ann, she wrote and suggested that we should spend our honeymoon in her cottage, or pigstye, and that I should pay her rent for it.
I cannot pretend to explain why, except on the supposition that romance is dead; at least in that circle of society in which the Snellings move.
Nothing could be more delightful.
"And what," inquired mrs Macpherson, "has Mary Ann given you?"
We are going for our honeymoon to Italy and the South of France.
The fact of having given Mary Ann a wedding present seems to fill them with a feeling of rancorous acidity which, to me, is inexplicable.
The woman's name is Brady.
Yes!
And it kept on snowing; that turned out to be quite a record in the way of snow storms.
I had not come all that way, and subjected myself to so much discomfort, to be played tricks with.
Presently feet were heard advancing along the passage-several pairs it seemed-and a light gleamed through the window over the door.
I would not give him pills.
I heard it tinkle in the distance.
I counted seven in a distance, I am convinced, of less than twenty miles.
I had long been wishing that an old-fashioned Christmas had been completely extinct before I had thought of adventuring in quest of one.
No doubt the five guineas were badly wanted; even a "lively family" would be hardly likely to advertise for a perfect stranger to spend Christmas with them if they were not.
It was a horrible journey.
Next time will do.
"Perhaps you had better come inside."
It is some satisfaction for me to be able to reflect that I made it warm for the officials, however cold I might have been myself.
That was the advertisement.
Are the people mad?"
There was something in the tone of his "Ah!" which whetted my curiosity, near the end of my tether though I was.
By the time the streets were like so many skating rinks it commenced to snow.
Was there a chuckle in the fellow's voice?
"mr Christopher, from London."
There appeared to be no knocker, though whether it had been "twisted" off was more than I could say.
She was apparently the careworn mother of a "lively family." Under such circumstances she was hardly likely to be "lively" herself, but her name was Madge, and it was the accident of her Christian name which decided me to go.
My temper was rising.
She and her husband, who suffers from melancholia, and all the other complaints which flesh is heir to, and I, dragging through what I call a patent medicine dinner, and talking of everybody who is dead and gone, or else going, and of nothing else.
That was all she said.
"Is there no one in the place?"
There was a rush of retreating feet, an expostulating voice, then darkness again, and silence.
When the train did start, some forty minutes after scheduled time, it jolted along in a laborious fashion at the rate of about six miles an hour, stopping at every roadside hovel.
Suddenly the cart pulled up.
I'm expected.
I pointed out to him that the rack was specially constructed for light luggage, that a hat box was light luggage, and that if the train jolted, he ought to blame the company, not me.
"Be you going to stop with they Wilsons?"
"Well-thereabouts."
There was a great shadow, which possibly did duty for a house, but, if so, there was not a light in any of the windows, and there was nothing visible in the shape of a door.
I was beyond it.
Finally the hulking lad was dispatched.
No doubt they would set him down as a lunatic right away.
No references were offered or asked for.
The driver's voice came from the background.
Be it all right?"
And yet, from my boyhood upward, I have desired to meet one. Here was an opportunity offered.
All night it had been blowing and raining.
"Do you think that you could manage, Tidy?"
Still I felt that it could hardly be worse than a chop or cousin Lucy; the subjects of her conversation I never cared about when they were alive, and I certainly do not want to talk about them now they are dead.
If they know you're coming perhaps they hear and don't choose to answer.
"Hard.
I'm afraid I can offer you nothing to drink.
After a few seconds' interval the pit pat of what was obviously one pair of feet came towards the door.
AN old-fashioned CHRISTMAS.
I was chilled to the bone, wet, tired, hungry.
"Have you any luggage?" I admitted that I had.
A voice inquired: "Who's there?"
So I wrote to the advertiser.
"I think I had."
"I drove him over from the station, Miss.
"An old-fashioned Christmas.--A lively family will accept a gentleman as paying guest to join them in spending an old-fashioned Christmas in the heart of the country."
On Christmas Eve the weather was abominable.
I had not given a Christmas present for years-there had been no one to give them to.
There was nothing said about the sort of accommodation which would be provided, nothing about the kind of establishment which was maintained, or the table which was kept.
Again a light gleamed through the pane.
Of course, I knew that I had no right to do anything of the kind, and was aware that the chances were a hundred to one against my ever presuming to hint at its existence.
The information was greeted with what sounded uncommonly like a chorus of laughter.
So I had to cool my heels for two hours and a half in a wretched cowshed amidst a bitter, whirling snowstorm.
Where's another thing.
CHAPTER one
He was impervious to reason.
There be a lot of luggage. He do say he's come to stay with you."
"Can I see mrs Wilson?
Then I had to wait three quarters of an hour for a train to take me back again, only to find that I had missed the one I intended to catch.
We passed through a gate, which I had to get down to open, along some sort of avenue.
"I can't say rightly as how I should, Miss.
I said I would go, and I meant to go.
What the "lively family" would think of a perfect stranger arriving burdened with rubbish, as if he had known them all their lives, I did not dare to think.
"It be about time as someone were to stay with them as were a bit capable like."
No answer; though I allowed a more than decent interval.
"Better ring again," suggested the driver.
We've lost the key of the cellar, and there's nothing out, except water, and I don't think you'd care for that."
Hardly the sort of weather to start for an unknown destination "in the heart of the country." But, at the last moment, I did not like to back out.
Once more I suspected the driver of a chuckle.
It had its points.
If they have, there's a bell on your right, if it isn't broken."
I hoped to goodness that he would not prove to be a hypochondriac, like Lucy's husband.
There was a trap at the "Boy and Blunderbuss," but that required fetching.
The youngest member of the family might be twenty, or the oldest ten.
THE PROMISE.
"I am."
The storm rushed in; she put up her hand to shield the light from danger.
"The mare, she'll stand still enough.
Now it is a remarkable thing that I have always had an extraordinary predilection for the name Madge.
Better ring again."
I even bought something for Madge-I mean mrs Wilson.
The whole thing was a trifle odd.
I tolled the bell again.
"Why do you ask?"
That is a fact.
Still, if you have not tried your hand at that kind of thing for ever so long, the mere act of purchasing is a pleasure.
That might be so.
I went inside; it was time.
I might arrive, it seemed, on Christmas Eve, but there was no hint as to when I was to go, if ever.
It appeared that the terms would be five guineas; but there was no mention of the length of time which that fee would cover.
After a vast amount of unfastening, the door was opened, and on the threshold there stood a girl, with a lighted candle in her hand.
I was not sure what, in this case, an old-fashioned Christmas might happen to mean.
I rang again, and again with all the force I could.
I had been idiot enough to load myself with a lot of Christmas presents, without the faintest notion why.
His wrangling and jangling so upset me, that I went past the station at which I ought to have changed.
When at last I reached Crofton, my journey's end, it turned out that the station staff consisted of a half witted individual, who was stationmaster, porter, and clerk combined, and a hulking lad who did whatever else there was to do.
"Here we be."
I looked at her; she at me.
I did not ask.
"Perhaps it had better be brought in."
I sounded another peal.
As for the "pills" and "drops" with which her husband doses himself between the courses, it makes me ill even to think of them.
The trains were late, and, of course, overcrowded; there was enough luggage in our compartment to have filled it, and still there was one more passenger than there ought to have been; an ill conditioned old fellow who wanted my hat box put into the van because it happened to tumble off the rack on to his head.
I felt quite lively myself as I mingled with the Christmas crowd, looking for things which might not turn out to be absolutely preposterous.
I knew nothing of the people I was going to.
The reply was written in a sprawling feminine hand.
Never shall I forget the drive, in that miserable cart, through the storm and those pitch black country lanes.
Maybe they're up to some of their games, and wants rousing."
I am no dealer in poisons.
The bell reverberated through what seemed like an empty house.
It was a pity he did not add where "here" was.
In the morning it began to freeze.
I did not expect a princely entertainment.
The whereabouts of this, however, the driver presently made clear.
I may as well say at once what my after experience taught me-namely, that with all their faults and extraordinary obliquity of mental vision upon many subjects, they are the very best bred people that I ever fell in with.
He at length asked me a single short question, which I supposed meant "Who are you?" I answered in English quite composedly as though he would understand me, and endeavoured to be my very most natural self as well as I could.
I expressed by signs my admiration and pleasure to my guides, and they were greatly pleased.
I never saw anything in the least comparable to them. The women were vigorous, and had a most majestic gait, their heads being set upon their shoulders with a grace beyond all power of expression. Each feature was finished, eyelids, eyelashes, and ears being almost invariably perfect.
The larger specimens had a case to themselves, and tickets with writing on them in a character which I could not understand.
It was here as hitherto: all things were generically the same as in Europe, the differences being of species only; and I was amused at seeing in a window some bottles with barley sugar and sweetmeats for children, as at home; but the barley sugar was in plates, not in twisted sticks, and was coloured blue.
In about four hours of walking from the time we started, and after passing two or three more villages, we came upon a considerable town, and my guides made many attempts to make me understand something, but I gathered no inkling of their meaning, except that I need be under no apprehension of danger.
The country was highly cultivated, every ledge being planted with chestnuts, walnuts, and apple trees from which the apples were now gathering.
They seemed concerned and uneasy as soon as they got hold of it.
They felt my pulse, they looked at my tongue, they listened at my chest, they felt all my muscles; and at the end of each operation they looked at the chief and nodded, and said something in a tone quite pleasant, as though I were all right.
When I had shown them what I did with it, they were astonished but not displeased, and seemed to like the smell.
Even in middle age they were still comely, and the old grey haired women at their cottage doors had a dignity, not to say majesty, of their own.
We passed many cases, and at last came to one in which there were several clocks and two or three old watches.
But by and by they came to my watch, which I had hidden away in the inmost pocket that I had, and had forgotten when they began their search.
Goats were abundant; also a kind of small black cattle, in the marshes near the river, which was now fast widening, and running between larger flats from which the hills receded more and more.
As soon as it was ended, they proceeded to overhaul my swag and the contents of my pockets.
I could fill many pages with a description of their dress and the ornaments which they wore, and a hundred details which struck me with all the force of novelty; but I must not stay to do so.
When we had got past the village the fog rose, and revealed magnificent views of the snowy mountains and their nearer abutments, while in front I could now and again catch glimpses of the great plains which I had surveyed on the preceding evening.
I will spare the reader any description of the town, and would only bid him think of Domodossola or Faido.
These two were first called out; and in about a quarter of an hour I was made to follow them, which I did in some fear, and with much curiosity.
The village was just like the one we had left, only rather larger.
They even pulled down my eyelids, and looked, I suppose, to see if they were bloodshot; but it was not so.
The men were as handsome as the women beautiful.
CHAPTER seven: FIRST IMPRESSIONS
Lastly, I should say that the people were of a physical beauty which was simply amazing.
The children were infinite in number, and exceedingly merry; I need hardly say that they came in for their full share of the prevailing beauty.
The design was different, but the thing was clearly the same.
In fact, one of them was plainly very much out of health, and coughed violently from time to time in spite of manifest efforts to suppress it.
He spoke to me solemnly and sternly for two or three minutes.
As I said before, all were marred and broken.
He appeared more and more puzzled, and then retired, returning with two others much like himself.
My hosts always bowed their heads as they passed one of these shrines, and it shocked me to see statues that had no apparent object, beyond the chronicling of some unusual individual excellence or beauty, receive so serious a homage.
He looked me all over for about five minutes, letting his eyes wander from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet, up and down, and down and up; neither did his mind seem in the least clearer when he had done looking than when he began.
Here the magistrate stopped, and opening the case began comparing my watch with the others.
We followed an Alpine path for some four miles, now hundreds of feet above a brawling stream which descended from the glaciers, and now nearly alongside it.
Their expression was divine; and as they glanced at me timidly but with parted lips in great bewilderment, I forgot all thoughts of their conversion in feelings that were far more earthly.
Glass was plentiful in the better houses.
I have always delighted in and reverenced beauty; but I felt simply abashed in the presence of such a splendid type-a compound of all that is best in Egyptian, Greek and Italian.
At least I fancied so, but I soon found my mistake.
The other looked pale and ill but he was marvellously self-contained, and it was impossible to say what was the matter with him.
But it was not so.
My guides spoke to many in passing, and those spoken to showed much amazement.
Sometimes we went through forests of pine, or rather yew trees, though they looked like pine; and I remember that now and again we passed a little wayside shrine, wherein there would be a statue of great beauty, representing some figure, male or female, in the very heyday of youth, strength, and beauty, or of the most dignified maturity and old age.
I remember that when they first found it I had thought of Paley, and how he tells us that a savage on seeing a watch would at once conclude that it was designed.
The morning was cold and somewhat foggy, for the autumn had made great strides latterly.
However, I showed no sign of wonder or disapproval; for I remembered that to be all things to all men was one of the injunctions of the Gentile Apostle, which for the present I should do well to heed.
Both of them appeared astonished at seeing one who was evidently a stranger, but they were too ill to come up to me, and form conclusions concerning me.
I was dazzled as I saw one after the other, of whom I could only feel that each was the loveliest I had ever seen.
Their colour was equal to that of the finest Italian paintings; being of the clearest olive, and yet ruddy with a glow of perfect health.
I saw a few sheep with rounded noses and enormous tails. Dogs were there in plenty, and very English; but I saw no cats, nor indeed are these creatures known, their place being supplied by a sort of small terrier.
This gave me little uneasiness, for I had no money with me, nor anything which they were at all likely to want, or which I cared about losing.
On my return, I purposely avoided looking into it until I had sent back my last revises to the printer.
Then I had much pleasure in reading it, but was indeed surprised at the many little points of similarity between the two books, in spite of their entire independence to one another.
Having now, I fear, at too great length done what I was asked to do, I should like to add a few words on my own account.
I have also parted with the word "infortuniam" (though not without regret), but have not dared to meddle with other similar inaccuracies.
The next part of "Erewhon" that I wrote was the "World of the Unborn," a preliminary form of which was sent to mr Holyoake's paper, but as I cannot find it among those copies of the Reasoner that are in the British Museum, I conclude that it was not accepted.
This is a mistake, though a perfectly natural one.
The Author wishes it to be understood that Erewhon is pronounced as a word of three syllables, all short-thus, E re whon.
june ninth eighteen seventy two
I also wrote about this time the substance of what ultimately became the Musical Banks, and the trial of a man for being in a consumption.
I had a telescope and a dog, and would take bread and meat and tobacco with me. Starting with early dawn, it would be night before I could complete my round; for the mountain over which I had to go was very high.
I would try the nearer range, and see how far I could go.
Aha! they see, and rush towards each other.
Men pushed farther and farther into the mountains, and found a very considerable tract inside the front range, between it and another which was loftier still, though even this was not the highest, the great snowy one which could be seen from out upon the plains.
Even if I did not find country, might I not find gold, or diamonds, or copper, or silver?
Could I hope to cross it?
Alas! they are both mistaken; the ewe is not the lamb's ewe, they are neither kin nor kind to one another, and part in coldness.
I knew that there was a range still farther back; but except from one place near the very top of my own mountain, no part of it was visible: from this point, however, I saw, whenever there were no clouds, a single snow clad peak, many miles away, and I should think about as high as any mountain in the world.
The climate was temperate, and very healthy; there were no wild animals, nor were the natives dangerous, being few in number and of an intelligent tractable disposition.
Ah! who could say?
This would be the highest triumph that I could wish for; but it was too much to think of yet.
The colony was one which had not been opened up even to the most adventurous settlers for more than eight or nine years, having been previously uninhabited, save by a few tribes of savages who frequented the seaboard.
wonderful!
Suffice it, that when I left home it was with the intention of going to some new colony, and either finding, or even perhaps purchasing, waste crown land suitable for cattle or sheep farming, by which means I thought that I could better my fortunes more rapidly than in England.
What they dealt in, how they laboured, to what end it all came, she had only the vaguest conception.
He seemed to be thinking of something else.
She would get in one of the great shops and do well enough until-well, until something happened. Neither of them knew exactly what.
She troubled herself over what else to put in the letter.
Anything was good enough so long as it paid-say, five dollars a week to begin with.
"At about twenty minutes of five."
In the interval which marked the preparation of the meal Carrie found time to study the flat.
Then she walked and sang to it, until Hanson, disturbed in his reading, came and took it.
His one observation to the point was concerning the chances of work in Chicago.
She read from the manner of Hanson, in the subdued air of Minnie, and, indeed, the whole atmosphere of the flat, a settled opposition to anything save a conservative round of toil.
CHAPTER two
She was pleased to see her in a way, but reflected her husband's point of view in the matter of work.
"You'd better look in those big manufacturing houses along Franklin Street and just the other side of the river," he concluded. "Lots of girls work there.
He was a silent man, American born, of a Swede father, and now employed as a cleaner of refrigerator cars at the stock yards.
Her husband asked a few questions and sat down to read the evening paper.
These vast buildings, what were they?
It isn't very far."
A shop girl was the destiny prefigured for the newcomer.
"I cannot have you call on me here.
"It's a big place," he said.
It was on the third floor, the front windows looking down into the street, where, at night, the lights of grocery stores were shining and children were playing.
"I've got to get up early in the morning, so I'll go to bed," and off he went, disappearing into the dark little bedroom off the hall, for the night.
These strange energies and huge interests, for what purposes were they there?
"No," she said to herself, "he can't come here."
WHAT POVERTY THREATENED: OF GRANITE AND BRASS
"Well, we'll go out Sunday and see Lincoln Park."
Carrie noticed that Hanson had said nothing to this.
He could not come here.
A pleasant side to his nature came out here. He was patient.
If Hanson sat every evening in the front room and read his paper, if he went to bed at nine, and Minnie a little later, what would they expect of her?
She had some slight gift of observation and that sense, so rich in every woman-intuition.
They did not figure on promotion. They did not exactly count on marriage.
"Well," she said, "I think I'll look around to morrow.
He arose from his chair and went and looked out into the street.
By the time he reached his own street he was keenly alive to the difficulties of his situation and wished over and over that some solution would offer itself, that he could see his way out.
He looked at the little chap with a feeling of doubt.
Shut him out and make him pay.
How much more pleasant it would be.
He jangled it fiercely several times in succession, but without avail.
He would go up there and have it out with her, that's what he would do.
"I saw a young girl up in that winder," returned the cabby.
She was carrying things with too high a hand.
These were his first thoughts.
He tore it open and read without a show of feeling.
She would find out at once just what advantages she could gain.
So this was the game, was it?
What could it mean?
Curse it!
He was in a fevered state of mind, owing to the blight his wife's action threatened to cast upon his entire future.
Hands were hidden in the pockets of the umbrellaless; umbrellas were up.
No answer.
He thanked his stars that he did not have to confront that proposition just now when he needed to think so much.
He saw no solution of anything-not a loophole left.
What a fool move that was."
My friends, too!" He grew more angry as he thought of the talk any action on her part would create.
It was the one pleasing thing in this whole rout of trouble.
Later, however, his old discretion asserted itself.
He knew her well enough to know that when she had decided upon a plan she would follow it up.
He would have no row.
If he could only get plenty of time to think, perhaps something would turn up.
He pulled out his key and tried to insert it, but another key was on the inside.
He began to wish that he had compromised in some way or other-that he had sent the money.
Pedestrians had turned up collars, and trousers at the bottom.
He could arrange that satisfactorily, for Carrie would be glad to wait, if necessary.
He scarcely noticed the picture.
Finally, seeing that no one was coming, he turned and went back to his cab.
Now that she had practically cowed him, she would follow up her work with demands, the acknowledgment of which would make her word law in the future.
He went in and examined his letters, but there was nothing from Carrie. Fortunately, there was nothing from his wife either.
His first impulse was to write but four words in reply-"Go to the devil!"--but he compromised by telling the boy that there would be no reply.
He alighted and went up the steps to the front door, but it was with a nervous palpitation of the heart.
She had not been able to get away this morning.
He would have to pay her the money which she would now regularly demand or there would be trouble.
What would she do about that?
ASHES OF TINDER: A FACE AT THE WINDOW
I need it to carry out my plans.
He walked the floor of his little office, and later that of his room, putting one thing and another together to no avail.
Hurstwood looked, but there was no face there now.
After a time he gave up waiting and drearily headed for the Madison car. To add to his distress, the bright blue sky became overcast with little fleecy clouds which shut out the sun
That night Hurstwood remained down town entirely, going to the Palmer House for a bed after his work was through.
The confounded wretch!
Hurstwood walked the floor, mentally arranging the chief points of his situation.
He rang again-this time harder.
Then he sat down in his chair and gazed without seeing, contemplating the result of his work.
He walked the floor again, pretending to be in an ordinary mood, but secretly troubled beyond the expression of words.
Hurstwood recognised his wife's writing.
He began to feel the appetite that had been wanting before he had reached the office, and decided before going out to the park to meet Carrie to drop in at the Grand Pacific and have a pot of coffee and some rolls.
You can stay away if you want to.
Then he would take up his wife's threat again, and the wrinkles and moisture would return.
He'd take it to her-he would go up there and have a talk with her, and that at once.
The audacity of the thing took his breath.
He put on his hat and looked around for his umbrella.
Perhaps he could do it up here.
He saw only her pretty face and neat figure and wondered why life was not arranged so that such joy as he found with her could be steadily maintained.
On the way his temper cooled as he thought of the details of the case.
Could something have happened out there to keep her away?
He would have to explain and deny and make a general mark of himself.
"What a fool trick that was.
While he was not sure how much significance might be attached to the threat she had made, he was sure that her attitude, if long continued, would cause him no end of trouble.
He rang the bell and then waited.
It roused his ire also-the deepest element of revolt in him.
He shook at the knob, but the door was locked.
"I'm to bring an answer," said the boy.
His spirits fell, however, when, upon reaching the park, he waited and waited and Carrie did not come.
She was determined, and had worsted him in a very important contest.
I'll make her change her tone if I have to use force to do it!"
"Damn her!" he said softly, with his teeth firmly set, "I'll make it hot for her if she causes me trouble.
He also thought of his managerial position.
Could she have been reached by his wife?
The street looked like a sea of round black cloth roofs, twisting, bobbing, moving.
So don't delay, but send it by the boy."
Many little wrinkles gathered between his eyes as he contemplated this, and his brow moistened.
I know her."
Come what might, he would adjust this matter, and soon.
There was no more to be done upon that score that night.
He was altogether a fine example of great mental perturbation.
Suddenly he thought: "Supposing she isn't out there-suppose she has gone?"
He saw that in the excitement of recent events he had not formulated a plan upon that score.
He would plead until her anger would melt-until she would forgive him.
"Well!" he said after a time, quite audibly, "I don't know."
It was the worst Sunday he had spent in his life.
It read:
Hurry right back."
He got back to his office and joined in a conversation with friends.
The boy hastened away and the manager fell to his musings.
To add to his misery there was no word from Carrie.
He really pined for a word, and looked out upon her with his mind's eye in the most wistful manner.
"She said it was high time."
He would go to her and tell her all his family complications. He would explain to her just where he stood and how much he needed her. Surely she couldn't go back on him now?
He thought he would go out and insist on seeing her if she did not send him word of some sort soon.
"You take this to this address," he said, handing him the envelope, "and give it to mrs Hurstwood."
He stayed at his desk long after all others had gone, and only quitted it when the night watchman on his round pulled at the front door to see if it was safely locked.
"Yes, sir," said the boy.
When Hurstwood got back to his office again he was in a greater quandary than ever.
ASHES OF TINDER: THE LOOSING OF STAYS
He could hardly realise how it had all come about.
He could see her meeting the boy at the door and smiling sardonically.
The hours slipped by, and with them the possibility of the union he had contemplated.
"I guess not."
"If she isn't there bring it back."
If he did, he would be offered terms that would make his blood boil.
He must get some speedier method-but how?
"Any answer?"
There was no use speculating over that.
"Very truly yours, etc"
How about that now?
Then he folded it up and put it in his pocket.
His absence did not seem to be noticed by either of his children.
He breathed heavily and wiped the moisture from his face.
For all his study nothing came of the evening except this-he sent the money.
What could be the trouble in that quarter?
One of the galling incidents of this visit was that he came back on a Randolph Street car, and without noticing arrived almost opposite the building of the concern with which his son was connected.
CHAPTER twenty five
He had evidently delivered the package, for, as he came up, he made no sign of taking anything out of his pocket.
He had loved her earnestly enough, but now that the possibility of losing her stared him in the face she seemed much more attractive.
He was beaten for to night and he might just as well make the best of it.
He strolled up and down the polished floor of the resort, his hands in his pockets, his brow wrinkled, his mouth set.
It wasn't possible.
Nevertheless, his rousing availed him nothing.
Lord, Lord, he thought, what had he got into?
That night he dined at Rector's and returned at once to his office.
She would take the envelope and know that she had triumphed.
Meanwhile, he would have time to think.
He drank more brandy and soda than he had any evening in months.
He did manage to bring himself into the mood to go out to Carrie, but when he got in Ogden Place he thought he saw a man watching him and went away.
Hurstwood scowled fiercely.
He decided to write her care of the West Side Post office and ask for an explanation, as well as to have her meet him.
It would be just like this to happen as things were going now. Meanwhile he had not sent the money.
So here it was spread out clear before him, and now he knew what to expect.
He was quite certain now that she knew he was married and was angered at his perfidy.
He was desperately in love, and would have taken great chances to win her under ordinary circumstances, but now-now what? Supposing she had found out something?
He was really affected most miserably of all by this desertion.
He read it through carefully several times, and then merely shook his head.
Well, well, fortune plays a man queer tricks.
In about an hour and three quarters the boy returned.
"You've seen my wife?" he asked as a precautionary measure as the boy turned to go.
Three o'clock came, four, five, six, and no letter.
Nothing from his wife, which was pleasant.
"Any answer?"
He was getting some vague comfort out of a good cigar, but it was no panacea for the ill which affected him.
"Compromise!" exclaimed Hurstwood bitterly.
It seemed a monstrous, unnatural, unwarranted condition which had suddenly descended upon him without his let or hindrance.
It seemed as if his family troubles were just beginning.
"Well?" said Hurstwood.
No word from Carrie.
The fact that he had sent the money and that she had received it worked to the ease of his mind, for, as the thought that he had done it receded, his chagrin at it grew less and his hope of peace more.
Every once in a while he would clinch his fingers and tap his foot-signs of the stirring mental process he was undergoing.
He did not propose to lose her, whatever she might think.
He did not go within a block of the house.
No letter had come, no word of any kind, and yet here it was late in the evening and she had agreed to meet him that morning.
Meanwhile he gave a thought now and then to Carrie.
How could things have taken such a violent turn, and so quickly?
He folded the letter and put it with the other one.
Now he had done it.
This sent a pang through his heart.
If he didn't go and see them they would sue him promptly.
"My wife?"
But, oh, the wretchedness of being forced this way!
"Yes, sir."
He wondered what the morning would bring forth, and slept anything but soundly upon it.
The thought that this letter would probably not reach her until Monday chafed him exceedingly.
"Yes, sir."
It was with great opposition, after two or three hours of the most urgent mental affirmation and denial, that at last he got an envelope, placed in it the requested amount, and slowly sealed it up.
In the bustle and show of the latter was his only relief.
Next day he went again to the office and opened his mail, suspicious and hopeful of its contents.
"All right, now.
He tried to get the interest of things about him, but it was not to be.
It was too much to think of and sit still.
He was forced to take his feet.
"Oh, yes, sir.
"I gave it to her."
He fancied, as he sat at his desk, that nothing would be done for a week or two.
He troubled over many little details and talked perfunctorily to everybody.
On Wednesday he received another polite note from McGregor, james and Hay.
"Through the kitchen to the parlor!" he said.
His being was like an all sided lens concentrating all joys in the one heart of his consciousness.
A little longer and she was compelled to yield, and the silent tears flowed freely.
A CATASTROPHE.
The music was broken, and Joseph left alone with the dumb instruments.
Letty, finding herself not quite equal to the emergency, came in her turn to call Mary: she went as quietly as if she were leaving a tiresome visitor.
It cried aloud that eternity was very long, and like a great palace without a quiet room.
One winter evening, as soon as his work was over for the day, Joseph locked the door of his smithy, washed himself well, put on clean clothes, and, taking his violin, set out for Testbridge: Mary was expecting him to tea.
His violin was broken, but his being was made whole! his treasure taken-type of his self, and a woman given him instead!
Mary came half-way to meet him.
It was the afternoon of a holiday, and she had closed early.
He that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how shall he love God whom he hath not seen?
Letty, too, was overcome-more than ever she had been by music.
A mood had taken shape in the mind of the blacksmith, and wandered from its home, seeking another country.
It broke the enchantment in which Joseph was bound.
He stepped across the floor, still, stately, and free.
When he reached Mary's shop, he turned into the court to the kitchen door.
Mary had not listened long before she found herself strangely moved. Her heart seemed to swell up into her throat, and it was all she could do to keep from weeping.
It prayed, it wept, it implored.
When he reached the suburbs, the light of homes was shining through curtains of all colors.
"It's just like him!" he murmured.
Earth was gone, and heaven was all.
That enchantment had possessed him, usurping as it were the throne of his life, and displacing it; when it ceased, he was not his own master.
How it happened he never could tell, but he brought down his violin with a crash against the piano, then somehow stumbled and all but fell.
O my God-through the mud of me, up to thy righteousness!"
Thus, in a garment of mood whose color and texture was music, did the soul of Joseph Jasper that evening, like a homeless ghost, come knocking at the door of Mary Marston.
On the bough of an apple tree, in the fair moonlight, sat a nightingale, swaying to and fro like one mad with the wine of his own music, singing as if he wanted to break his heart and have done, for the delight was too much for mortal creature to endure.
His manner was much more considered and grave.
"This is your discharge from the Palmetto Guards," he said.
This was not the fashion of a year ago, when they exchanged a friendly word or two, but Harry knew its cause.
Boats put out both from the fort and the shore.
"Look out for what?"
He had little fear.
But he saw nothing that moved there.
People were cooler here and they were more prone to look at the two sides of a question.
He was watching the boats.
"If you've got pistols, just you think once before you shoot," said Collins.
It was afternoon when he reached the little station of Winton and left the train, a tall, sturdy boy, the superior of many a man in size, strength and agility.
CHAPTER seven
I shall look for you there."
The very triumph and joy of living penetrated his soul. Youth swept aside the terrors of war.
You were at the bombardment of Fort Sumter, they tell me! It's made a mighty stir in these parts!
Harry's heart and judgment alike responded to the call.
"I will," replied Harry, with vivid recollection of his ride from Pendleton to Winton.
"Colonel Kenton writes wisely.
All the winds blew in the same direction in South Carolina and they sang one song of triumph, but in Kentucky they were variable and conflicting, and their voices were many.
The story was enough, too, to make one's blood boil.
I wouldn't give a halfpenny for the whole lot.
"He isn't fit to hear what's said here.
There's no sale for it.
I couldn't do anything with Stevie that afternoon.
It isn't his fault.
He gets a red face poring over them.
And Mr Ossipon brings every week a pile of these f p tracts to sell at a halfpenny each.
He gets into his passions over it."
Mr Verloc made no comment.
We aren't German slaves here, thank God.
The other day Stevie got hold of one, and there was a story in it of a German soldier officer tearing half off the ear of a recruit, and nothing was done to him for it.
He can't help being excitable.
"I wish he had never been to school," Mrs Verloc began again brusquely. "He's always taking away those newspapers from the window to read.
We don't get rid of a dozen numbers in a month.
But what's the use of printing things like that?
"He glared at me, as if he didn't know who I was, when I went downstairs. His heart was going like a hammer.
He believes it's all true.
The brute!
It's silly reading-that's what it is.
My uncle and I came behind, cutting a very tolerable figure upon our small but vigorous animals.
CHAPTER nine
It contains thirty thousand square miles of surface, and has about seventy thousand inhabitants.
Three hours later, still traveling over those apparently interminable and sandy prairies, we were compelled to go round the Kollafjord, an easier and shorter cut than crossing the gulfs.
A few stray cows and sheep were only seen occasionally.
As there was nothing I liked better than horse exercise, the pleasure of riding through an unknown country caused the early part of our enterprise to be particularly agreeable to me.
The sweeping and broken waves came rolling in upon the pointed rocks; the gulf was surrounded by rocky walls-a mighty cliff, three thousand feet in height, remarkable for its brown strata, separated here and there by beds of tufa of a reddish hue.
These sacred edifices are, however, very much like these people, who do without watches-and never miss them.
We took our way through poor and sparse meadows, which made a desperate effort every year to show a little green.
"Good beast, good beast," he would cry.
It consists simply of a few houses-not what in England or Germany we should call a hamlet.
All this while we were advancing at a rapid pace.
Little did I expect, however, the spectacle which awaited us when we reached the peninsula of Sneffels, where agglomerations of nature's ruins form a kind of terrible chaos.
He moves so little that it is impossible for him to become fatigued.
Hans, our extraordinary guide, went first, walking with a steady, rapid, unvarying step.
He shared our frugal breakfast, answered Yes, and No to my uncle's questions as to the nature of the road, and at last when asked where we were to pass the night was as laconic as usual.
I began to enjoy the exhilarating delight of traveling, a life of desire, gratification and liberty.
"What, a ferry boat!"
I thoroughly understood and appreciated the necessity for waiting, before crossing the fjord, for that moment when the sea at its highest point is in a state of slack water.
Hans, on taking his departure from Reykjavik, had followed the line of the sea.
The favorable moment did not come until six o'clock in the evening.
Besides, if he were to complain of weariness, he could have the loan of my horse.
There could be no doubt that this was all this terrible Saknussemm had done.
My uncle had not even the satisfaction of urging forward his steed by whip, spur, or voice.
Our horses, however, appeared not only well acquainted with the country, but by a kind of instinct, knew which was the best road.
My uncle frowned, stamped his feet and then followed the horses to where the boat lay.
The rugged summits of the rocky hills were dimly visible on the edge of the horizon, through the misty fogs; every now and then some heavy flakes of snow showed conspicuous in the morning light, while certain lofty and pointed rocks were first lost in the grey low clouds, their summits clearly visible above, like jagged reefs rising from a troublous sea.
"Tidvatten," said the guide.
Then my uncle, myself, and guide, two boatmen and the four horses got into a very awkward flat bottom boat.
Accustomed as I had been to the steam ferry boats of the Elbe, I found the long oars of the boatmen but sorry means of locomotion.
Every now and then a spur of rock came down through the arid ground, leaving us scarcely room to pass.
"If they are really intelligent," I said to myself, "they will certainly not make the attempt.
We must not, however, attempt to hurry him; we must allow him to have his own way, and I will undertake to say that between us we shall do our ten leagues a day."
The weather was overcast but settled, when we commenced our adventurous and perilous journey.
"Why did you not say so before," cried my uncle; "why not start at once?"
He dug his heels into the sides of his steed, and made for the shore.
All, then, that may be required of me I will do cheerfully, and will create no difficulty.
The country we had reached was already nearly a desert.
It was, in fact, real tourist weather.
Look at Hans.
We were to learn this all in good time.
OUR START-WE MEET WITH ADVENTURES BY THE WAY
What, then, must be the state of the less known and more distant parts of the island?
They very rarely succeed in a good show of yellow.
I should have a violent attack of the cramp if I were not to have some sort of exercise.
"Der," answered Hans, pointing to where lay the boat in question-"there."
His horse went to the very edge of the water, sniffed at the approaching wave and retreated.
"What does he say?" I asked, considerably puzzled by the delay and the dialogue.
"We may do so," was my reply, "but what about our worthy guide?"
We had neither to fear fatiguing heat nor drenching rain.
I pointed this out to my uncle, who made a very energetic grimace.
My arms are right-but my legs are getting a little stiff."
"He says tide," replied my uncle, translating the Danish word for my information.
Snow, tempest, impracticable roads, rocks, icebergs-nothing stops him.
"Of course I understand-we must wait till the tide serves."
But my uncle was in no humor to wait.
Our two horses with the luggage followed of their own accord, without requiring whip or spur.
At length the sturdy little pony, spreading out his legs, in a stiff and ludicrous attitude, got from under the Professor's legs, and left him standing, with both feet on a separate stone, like the Colossus of Rhodes.
In reality, the great volcanic movement of the island, and all its attendant phenomena, are concentrated in the interior of the island; there, horizontal layers or strata of rocks, piled one upon the other, eruptions of basaltic origin, and streams of lava, have given this country a kind of supernatural reputation.
In this country there are no roads, paths are nearly unknown, and vegetation, poor as it was, slowly as it reached perfection, soon obliterated all traces of the few travelers who passed from place to place.
The truth is, that my spirits rose so rapidly, that I began to be indifferent to what had once appeared to be a terrible journey.
He was about to make some energetic observation to the guide, but Hans, without taking the slightest notice of him, went in front of the horses, and walked ahead with the same imperturbable phlegm he had always exhibited.
He is brave; he is sober; he is safe; he never makes a false step; never glides or slips from his path.
Now, whatever may have been the intelligence of our horses, I had not the slightest reliance upon them, as a means of crossing a stormy arm of the sea.
In any case, I shall trust rather to my own intelligence than theirs."
To ride over salt water upon the back of a little horse seemed to me absurd.
Hans stopped here one half hour.
What, then, must we expect when we come to the upheaved regions-to the districts broken and roughened from volcanic eruptions and subterraneous commotions?
Geographers have divided it into four parts, and we had to cross the southwest quarter which in the vernacular is called Sudvestr Fjordungr.
"For bida?" asked my uncle.
It was just before we left Reykjavik that I came to this decision.
A vast field of lava skirts it on one side, falling away in terraces towards the sea.
"How the worse difficulty over?" I cried in fresh amazement.
I saw but few inhabitants during my excursion, but I met a crowd on the beach, drying, salting and loading codfish, the principal article of exportation.
They were now, however, absent on duty.
From that moment the schooner was steered to the westward in order to round Cape Reykjanes, the western point of Iceland.
After some hours we came in sight of a solitary rock in the ocean, forming a mighty vault, through which the foaming waves poured with intense fury.
Their costume consists of a coarse capote of black wool, known in Scandinavian countries as the "vadmel," a broad brimmed hat, trousers of red serge, and a piece of leather tied with strings for a shoe-a coarse kind of moccasin.
Here we are in Iceland.
As usual, the crew was small, five Danes doing the whole of the work.
Upon an eminence close at hand was the national school, in which were taught Hebrew, English, French, and Danish.
I had soon seen all I wanted of these weary and dismal thoroughfares. Here and there was a strip of discolored turf, like an old worn out bit of woolen carpet; and now and then a bit of kitchen garden, in which grew potatoes, cabbage, and lettuce, almost diminutive enough to suggest the idea of Lilliput.
We have only to go down-but, as far as I am concerned, that is not the question.
The town lies on a flat and marshy plain, between two hills.
Our Voyage to Iceland
Her cargo was coal, furniture, pottery, woolen clothing, and a load of corn.
I bore it very well, but my uncle to his great annoyance, and even shame, was remarkably seasick!
No trees, no vegetation, so to speak-on all sides volcanic peaks-the huts of turf and earth-more like roofs than houses.
I shall be glad to consult them."
Sometimes they gave vent to a convulsive laugh, but by no chance did they smile.
My uncle was delighted; for myself, moody and dissatisfied, I appeared almost to expect a glimpse of the ghost of Hamlet.
In three hours my tour was complete.
A few minutes afterwards, the schooner started before the wind, under all the canvas she could carry, and entered the channel.
You might perhaps even follow us to the centre of the earth, there to resolve your eternal doubts."
"Sublime madman," thought I, "you doubtless would approve our proceedings.
On the eleventh day we sighted Cape Portland, over which towered Mount Myrdals Yokul, which, the weather being clear, we made out very readily. The cape itself is nothing but a huge mount of granite standing naked and alone to meet the Atlantic waves.
"In the meanwhile," I replied, "I will take a walk through the town. Will you not likewise do so?"
Though not very large, it appeared not likely to be filled for centuries.
"That is the least part of the business, and does not in any way trouble me.
"How long will the voyage last?" asked my uncle.
Then without further remark, he put his finger to his lips, frowned darkly, and descended into the small boat which awaited us.
"Well, sir, to a certain extent you are right.
I have not the slightest doubt that in high winds its red tiles were blown out, to the great annoyance of the pastor and congregation.
I want to know how we are to get up again."
Out of three rooms of which his house was composed, two were placed at our service, and in a few hours we were installed with all our baggage, the amount of which rather astonished the simple inhabitants of Reykjavik.
The men appeared robust but heavy; fair haired like Germans, but of pensive mien-exiles of a higher scale in the ladder of humanity than the Eskimos, but, I thought, much more unhappy, since with superior perceptions they are compelled to live within the limits of the Polar Circle.
In the centre of the new commercial street, I found the public cemetery, enclosed by an earthen wall.
The castle of Kronborg soon disappeared in the murky atmosphere, as well as the tower of Helsinborg, which raises its head on the Swedish Bank. And here the schooner began to feel in earnest the breezes of the Kattegat.
He was, however, but a civil servant, a magistrate, the governor of the island-Baron Trampe.
At all events, we shall get there some day."
"What for me is curious in this island, is not what is above the surface, but what is below."
The other street, situated more to the west, runs toward a little lake between the residences of the bishop and the other personages not engaged in commerce.
"Well, and have we a fair wind?" cried my uncle, in his most mellifluous accents.
CHAPTER six
The voyage offered no incident worthy of record.
The hour of departure came at last.
I bowed by way of reply, put on my hat and furred cloak, and went out.
My uncle came out of his cabin pale, haggard, thin, but full of enthusiasm, his eyes dilated with pleasure and satisfaction.
Nearly the whole population of the town was on foot to see us land.
The fact is, the castle is much later than the time of the heroic prince of Denmark.
I am about to visit the public library.
But this power of discernment was denied them, and only in after years, with the loved ones of their own firesides close about them, was the whole picture revealed.
From the beginning Minnetaki returned the young factor's affections, but a most potent reason prevented their marriage.
There were now few lonely hours for the two boys.
Minnetaki herself replied to this ultimatum.
In the end they came to an understanding.
The country is alive with them, and the government gives a bounty of fifteen dollars for every scalp taken. Two winters ago I killed forty and I did not make a business of it at that.
Had the young hunters the power of looking into the future, their camp fire that night on the frozen Ombabika might have been one of their last, and a few days later would have seen them back on the edges of civilization.
Not until the eleventh did he arrive at Sprucewood.
Those who were left moved to the vicinity of the Post.
If there is such a thing as love at first sight, it sprang into existence the moment john Newsome's eyes fell upon this lovely princess.
We will hunt wolves.
The feud still existed.
It was accompanied by one from the factor himself, another from the princess mother, and by a tiny note from Minnetaki, who pleaded with the others that Roderick and mrs Drew might spend the winter with them at Wabinosh House.
We have everything here."
The passing of each day became a painful task to him.
On the tenth of October he would meet Rod at Sprucewood, on the Black Sturgeon River.
CHAPTER two
Yet, if an enemy should honor us with a call, his trust will not be misplaced, and he will go away convinced that he has met with a royal host!
The betrothal might or might not be discussed and approved by the parents, but in either case it was customary for the young pair to disappear into the wilderness, there to pass some days or weeks in perfect seclusion and dual solitude, afterward returning to the village as man and wife.
Presently she returns to the camp, carrying the mysterious, the holy, the dearest bundle!
The remoter degrees of kinship were fully recognized, and that not as a matter of form only: first cousins were known as brothers and sisters; the name of "cousin" constituted a binding claim, and our rigid morality forbade marriage between cousins in any known degree, or in other words within the clan.
The ordeal is best met alone, where no curious or pitying eyes embarrass her; where all nature says to her spirit: "'tis love!
When she fell, the whole race fell with her.
It has been said that the position of woman is the test of civilization, and that of our women was secure.
Here he throws handfuls of clear, cold water into his face, or plunges in bodily.
At the age of about eight years, if he is a boy, she turns him over to his father for more Spartan training.
Advancing years brought with them much freedom, not only from the burden of laborious and dangerous tasks, but from those restrictions of custom and etiquette which were religiously observed by all others.
He wakes at daybreak, puts on his moccasins and steps down to the water's edge.
There was no priest to assume responsibility for another's soul.
Early Religious Teaching.
A soft, low voice was considered an excellent thing in man, as well as in woman!
If a girl, she is from this time much under the guardianship of her grandmother, who is considered the most dignified protector for the maiden.
Silence and isolation are the rule of life for the expectant mother.
All of the family property was held by her, descent was traced in the maternal line, and the honor of the house was in her hands.
His respect for the immortal part of the animal, his brother, often leads him so far as to lay out the body of his game in state and decorate the head with symbolic paint or feathers.
The very name of our tribe, Dakota, means Allied People.
The family was not only the social unit, but also the unit of government.
In the old days, our mothers were single eyed to the trust imposed upon them; and as a noted chief of our people was wont to say: "Men may slay one another, but they can never overcome the woman, for in the quietude of her lap lies the child!
In them was vested our standard of morals and the purity of our blood.
The Indian was a religious man from his mother's womb.
Every act of his life is, in a very real sense, a religious act.
His mate may precede or follow him in his devotions, but never accompanies him.
Pre natal Influence.
THE FAMILY ALTAR
She continues her spiritual teaching, at first silently-a mere pointing of the index finger to nature; then in whispered songs, bird like, at morning and evening.
Friendship is held to be the severest test of character.
He cuts off the choicest morsel of the meat and casts it into the fire-the purest and most ethereal element.
In due time the child takes of his own accord the attitude of prayer, and speaks reverently of the Powers.
Modesty was her chief adornment; hence the younger women were usually silent and retiring: but a woman who had attained to ripeness of years and wisdom, or who had displayed notable courage in some emergency, was sometimes invited to a seat in the council.
She feels the endearing warmth of it and hears its soft breathing.
And when the day of days in her life dawns-the day in which there is to be a new life, the miracle of whose making has been intrusted to her, she seeks no human aid.
Indian names were either characteristic nicknames given in a playful spirit, deed names, birth names, or such as have a religious and symbolic meaning.
That is, we believed, the supreme duty of the parent, who only was permitted to claim in some degree the priestly office and function, since it is his creative and protecting power which alone approaches the solemn function of Deity.
A Sioux prophet predicted the coming of the white man fully fifty years before the event, and even described accurately his garments and weapons.
It was quickly agreed by both parties that they should camp together for several days, and one evening the Sioux made a "warriors' feast" to which they invited many of the Ojibways.
The attitude of the Indian toward death, the test and background of life, is entirely consistent with his character and philosophy.
Death has no terrors for him; he meets it with simplicity and perfect calm, seeking only an honorable end as his last gift to his family and descendants.
His family affections are strong, and he grieves intensely for the lost, even though he has unbounded faith in a spiritual companionship.
At another time, when I was fourteen years old, we had just left Fort Ellis on the Assiniboine River, and my youngest uncle had selected a fine spot for our night camp.
The father of Little Crow, the chief who led the "Minnesota massacre" of eighteen sixty two, was another prophet of some note.
Some of us seemed to have a peculiar intuition for the locality of a grave, which they explained by saying that they had received a communication from the spirit of the departed.
Occult and Psychic Powers.
No doubt, many predictions have been colored to suit the new age, and unquestionably false prophets, fakirs, and conjurers have become the pest of the tribes during the transition period.
They sent out scouts, who soon returned with news of the approaching party.
The response came in like manner, and they entered the camp, with the peace pipe in the hands of the prophet.
The prophet asked his twin brother to sing one of his sacred songs, and behold! it was the very song that he himself was wont to sing.
The outward signs of mourning for the dead are far more spontaneous and convincing than is the correct and well ordered black of civilization. Both men and women among us loosen their hair and cut it according to the degree of relationship or of devotion.
The Gift of Prophecy.
If one be dying at home, it is customary to carry his bed out of doors as the end approaches, that his spirit may pass under the open sky.
Death and Funeral Customs.
At the end of a year from the time of death, the relatives made a public feast and gave away the clothing and other gifts, while the lock of hair was interred with appropriate ceremonies.
The Sacred Lock of Hair. Reincarnation and the Converse of Spirits.
Of course, the outward signs of burial had been long since obliterated.
This was carried out to the letter.
ON THE BORDER LAND OF SPIRITS
There are many trustworthy men, and men of Christian faith, to vouch for these and similar events occurring as foretold.
There was a well-known Sioux war prophet who lived in the middle of the last century, so that he is still remembered by the old men of his band. After he had reached middle age, he declared that he had a spirit brother among the Ojibways, the ancestral enemies of the Sioux.
One of his characteristic prophecies was made only a few years before he died, when he had declared that, although already an old man, he would go once more upon the war path.
This child lived to become great among us, as was intimated to the superstitious by the circumstances of his birth.
This incident made a great impression upon our people.
Finally, the wailing for the dead is continued night and day to the point of utter voicelessness; a musical, weird, and heart piercing sound, which has been compared to the "keening" of the Celtic mourner.
Certainly the Indian never doubted the immortal nature of the spirit or soul of man, but neither did he care to speculate upon its probable state or condition in a future life.
The tree, the waterfall, the grizzly bear, each is an embodied Force, and as such an object of reverence.
The worship of the "Great Mystery" was silent, solitary, free from all self seeking.
They spoke much of spiritual things, while seeking only the material.
Our faith might not be formulated in creeds, nor forced upon any who were unwilling to receive it; hence there was no preaching, proselyting, nor persecution, neither were there any scoffers or atheists.
The elements and majestic forces in nature, Lightning, Wind, Water, Fire, and Frost, were regarded with awe as spiritual powers, but always secondary and intermediate in character.
Having first prepared himself by means of the purifying vapor bath, and cast off as far as possible all human or fleshly influences, the young man sought out the noblest height, the most commanding summit in all the surrounding region.
It was silent, because all speech is of necessity feeble and imperfect; therefore the souls of my ancestors ascended to God in wordless adoration.
We believed that the spirit pervades all creation and that every creature possesses a soul in some degree, though not necessarily a soul conscious of itself.
The native American has been generally despised by his white conquerors for his poverty and simplicity.
It was clear to him that virtue and happiness are independent of these things, if not incompatible with them.
Among us all men were created sons of God and stood erect, as conscious of their divinity.
The Indian loved to come into sympathy and spiritual communion with his brothers of the animal kingdom, whose inarticulate souls had for him something of the sinless purity that we attribute to the innocent and irresponsible child.
To him, as to other single minded men in every age and race, from Diogenes to the brothers of Saint Francis, from the Montanists to the Shakers, the love of possessions has appeared a snare, and the burdens of a complex society a source of needless peril and temptation.
The first is pure spirit, concerned only with the essence of things, and it was this he sought to strengthen by spiritual prayer, during which the body is subdued by fasting and hardship.
But it was not so easy to overlook or to excuse national bad faith.
It was not, then, wholly from ignorance or improvidence that he failed to establish permanent towns and to develop a material civilization. To the untutored sage, the concentration of population was the prolific mother of all evils, moral no less than physical.
This is the material or physical prayer.
He had faith in their instincts, as in a mysterious wisdom given from above; and while he humbly accepted the supposedly voluntary sacrifice of their bodies to preserve his own, he paid homage to their spirits in prescribed prayers and offerings.
The Savage Philosopher.
Of the vision or sign vouchsafed to him he did not speak, unless it had included some commission which must be publicly fulfilled. Sometimes an old man, standing upon the brink of eternity, might reveal to a chosen few the oracle of his long past youth.
It was solitary, because they believed that He is nearer to us in solitude, and there were no priests authorized to come between a man and his Maker.
The lust for money, power, and conquest so characteristic of the Anglo Saxon race did not escape moral condemnation at the hands of his untutored judge, nor did he fail to contrast this conspicuous trait of the dominant race with the spirit of the meek and lowly Jesus.
Not only did they not profess it, but they stooped so low as to insult their God with profane and sacrilegious speech!
In his own thought he rose superior to them!
The Paradox of "Christian Civilization."
With his limited knowledge of cause and effect, he saw miracles on every hand,--the miracle of life in seed and egg, the miracle of death in lightning flash and in the swelling deep! Nothing of the marvelous could astonish him; as that a beast should speak, or the sun stand still.
The original attitude of the American Indian toward the Eternal, the "Great Mystery" that surrounds and embraces us, was as simple as it was exalted.
To him it was the supreme conception, bringing with it the fullest measure of joy and satisfaction possible in this life.
To him, it appeared shocking and almost incredible that there were among this people who claimed superiority many irreligious, who did not even pretend to profess the national faith.
Yet the religion that is preached in our churches and practiced by our congregations, with its element of display and self aggrandizement, its active proselytism, and its open contempt of all religions but its own, was for a long time extremely repellent.
In this type of prayer there was no beseeching of favor or help.
None might exhort or confess or in any way meddle with the religious experience of another.
From the Sun, as the universal father, proceeds the quickening principle in nature, and in the patient and fruitful womb of our mother, the Earth, are hidden embryos of plants and men.
At the solemn hour of sunrise or sunset he took up his position, overlooking the glories of earth and facing the "Great Mystery," and there he remained, naked, erect, silent, and motionless, exposed to the elements and forces of His arming, for a night and a day to two days and nights, but rarely longer.
Solitary Worship.
Who may condemn his superstition?
We have still to face the ultimate miracle,--the origin and principle of life!
All who have lived much out of doors know that there is a magnetic and nervous force that accumulates in solitude and that is quickly dissipated by life in a crowd; and even his enemies have recognized the fact that for a certain innate power and self poise, wholly independent of circumstances, the American Indian is unsurpassed among men.
He might in time come to recognize that the drunkards and licentious among white men, with whom he too frequently came in contact, were condemned by the white man's religion as well, and must not be held to discredit it.
Being a natural man, the Indian was intensely poetical.
The Indian was a logical and clear thinker upon matters within the scope of his understanding, but he had not yet charted the vast field of nature or expressed her wonders in terms of science.
Surely not the devout Catholic, or even Protestant missionary, who teaches Bible miracles as literal fact! The logical man must either deny all miracles or none, and our American Indian myths and hero stories are perhaps, in themselves, quite as credible as those of the hebrews of old.
The sun shines freely into its mouth, and graceful bunches of grass and eriogonums and sage grow about it, doing what they can toward its redemption from degrading associations and making it beautiful.
Probably ninety nine per cent of it is at once absorbed and drained away beneath the porous lava folds of the mountain to gush forth, filtered and pure, in the form of immense springs, so large, some of them, that they give birth to rivers that start on their journey beneath the sun, full grown and perfect without any childhood.
Every landscape, low and high, seems doomed to be trampled and harried.
That any kind of plant can hold on and grow beneath the wear of so boisterous a current seems truly wonderful, even after taking into consideration the freedom of the water from cutting drift, and the constance of its volume and temperature throughout the year.
It comes in a grand, eager gush from a horizontal seam in the face of the wall of the river gorge in the form of a partially interrupted sheet nearly seventy five yards in width, and at a height above the riverbed of about forty feet, as nearly as I could make out without the means of exact measurement.
From year to year in the kindly weather the beds are thus gathering beauty-beauty for ashes.
The way lies by Mount Bremer, over stretches of gray sage plains, interrupted by rough lava slopes timbered with juniper and yellow pine, and with here and there a green meadow and a stream.
The poor fellows that lie here deserve far more pity than they have ever received.
Then you are free to make wide waverings and zigzags away from the roads to visit the great fountain streams of the rivers, the glaciers also, and the wildest retreats in the primeval forests, where the best plants and animals dwell, and where many a flower bell will ring against your knees, and friendly trees will reach out their fronded branches and touch you as you pass.
Its waters, apparently unaffected by flood or drouth, heat or cold, fall at once into white rapids with a rush and dash, as if glad to escape from the darkness to begin their wild course down the canyon to the plain.
Only a little food will be required.
Here, too, you may find the curious but unlovable darlingtonia, a carnivorous plant that devours bumblebees, grasshoppers, ants, moths, and other insects, with insatiable appetite.
The surface, though smooth in a general way as seen from a distance, is dotted with hillocks and rough crater like pits, and traversed by a network of yawning fissures, forming a combination of topographical conditions of very striking character.
It measures twenty five or thirty feet in diameter at the entrance, and extends but a short distance in a horizontal direction.
Berries and plums abound in season, and quail and grouse and deer-the magnificent shaggy mule deer as well as the common species.
But Shasta is always at home to those who love her, and is ever in a thrill of enthusiastic activity-burning fires within, grinding glaciers without, and fountains ever flowing.
"...beneath dim aisles, in odorous beds, The slight Linnaea hang its twin born heads, And [bless] the monument of the man of flowers, Which breathes his sweet fame through the northern bowers."
A thousand thousand voices are heard, but so finely blended they seem a part of the night itself, and make a deeper silence.
Here you trace yawning fissures, there clusters of somber pits; now you mark where the lava is bent and corrugated in swelling ridges and domes, again where it breaks into a rough mass of loose blocks.
The banks are fringed with rubus, rose, plum cherry, spiraea, azalea, honeysuckle, hawthorn, ash, alder, elder, aster, goldenrod, beautiful grasses, sedges, rushes, mosses, and ferns with fronds as large as the leaves of palms-all in the midst of a richly forested landscape.
Then, darkness like death.
Miles of its flanks are dotted with hot springs, many of them so sulphurous and boisterous and noisy in their boiling that they seem inclined to become geysers like those of the Yellowstone.
Yosemite was not held for a single day against the pursuing troops; but the Modocs held their fort for months, until, weary of being hemmed in, they chose to withdraw.
But neither the glorified woods on the one hand, nor the lake on the other, could at first hold the eye.
This is a graveyard where lie buried thirty soldiers, most of whom met their fate out in the Lava Beds, as we learn by the boards marking the graves-a gloomy place to die in, and deadly looking even without Modocs.
As you sweep around so grand a center, the mountain itself seems to turn, displaying its riches like the revolving pyramids in jewelers' windows.
Here you are looking southeastward, and the Modoc landscape, which at once takes possession of you, lies revealed in front.
Captain Jack's cave is one of the many somber cells of the castle.
Nowhere within the limits of California are the forests of yellow pine so extensive and exclusive as on the headwaters of the Pitt.
One blanket will be enough to carry, or you may forego the pleasure and burden altogether, as wood for fires is everywhere abundant.
These volcanic caves are not wanting in interest, and it is well to light a pitch pine torch and take a walk in these dark ways of the underworld whenever opportunity offers, if for no other reason to see with new appreciation on returning to the sunshine the beauties that lie so thick about us.
The vivid green of the boulders beneath the water is very striking, and colors the entire stream with the exception of the portions broken into foam.
Next morning the crisp, sunshiny air made even the Modoc landscape less hopeless, and we ventured down the bluff to the edge of the Lava Beds. Just at the foot of the bluff we came to a square enclosed by a stone wall.
The full grown bucks weigh nearly three hundred and fifty pounds.
The ducks, less wary, kept their places, merely swimming in and out through openings in the rushes, rippling the glassy water, and raising spangles in their wake.
Far the most beautiful and richly furnished of the mountain caves of California occur in a thick belt of metamorphic limestone that is pretty generally developed along the western flank of the Sierra from the McCloud River to the Kaweah, a distance of nearly four hundred miles.
Perhaps the profession of doing good may be full, but every body should be kind at least to himself.
Food may be had at moderate intervals, and the whole circuit forms one ever deepening, broadening stream of enjoyment.
Fall River is a very remarkable stream.
The walls in many places overhang; in others they are beveled, loose, and shifting where the channel has been eroded by cinders, ashes, strata of firm lavas, and glacial drift, telling of many a change from frost to fire and their attendant floods of mud and water.
When I first stood there, one bright day before sundown, the lake was fairly blooming in purple light, and was so responsive to the sky in both calmness and color it seemed itself a sky.
Large flocks dwell here from year to year, winter and summer, descending occasionally into the adjacent sage plains and lava beds to feed, but ever ready to take refuge in the jagged crags of their mountain at every alarm.
Take a course of good water and air, and in the eternal youth of Nature you may renew your own.
That dark mysterious lava plain between them compelled attention.
The neighboring trees look into the charmed circle as if the noon of another day had come, familiar flowers and grasses that chance to be near seem far more beautiful and impressive than by day, and as the dead trees give forth their light all the other riches of their lives seem to be set free and with the rejoicing flames rise again to the sky.
The long gray slopes leading up to the glacier seem remarkably smooth and unbroken.
Here you strike the old emigrant road, which leads over the low divide to the eastern slopes of the mountain.
Even the sky is not safe from scath-blurred and blackened whole summers together with the smoke of fires that devour the woods.
It is three or four miles long and terminates at an elevation of about nine thousand five hundred feet above sea level, in moraine sprinkled ice cliffs sixty feet high.
It is only about ten miles long, and is composed of springs, rapids, and falls-springs beautifully shaded at one end of it, a showy fall one hundred and eighty feet high at the other, and a rush of crystal rapids between.
The view obtained of the Whitney Glacier should tempt you to visit it, since it is the largest of the Shasta glaciers and its lower portion abounds in beautiful and interesting cascades and crevasses.
The color is chiefly due to a species of algae which seems common in springs of this sort.
Their long, massive ears give them a very striking appearance.
It is a mass of lava presenting to the gray sage plain of Shasta Valley a bold craggy front two thousand feet high.
How far destruction may go it is not easy to guess.
The mule deer are nearly as heavy.
Then the shining of the wet leaves is delightful, and the steamy fragrance, and the burst of bird song from a multitude of thrushes and finches and warblers that have nests in the chaparral.
The gorge through which the glacier is drained is raw looking, deep and narrow, and indescribably jagged.
The floor is littered with the bones of the animals slaughtered for food during the war.
No mountain shore hides its loveliness.
Under certain conditions you may hear the roar of the water rushing from the rock at a distance of half a mile, or even more; or you may not hear it until within a few rods.
To judge from the few I have seen, Modocs are not very amiable looking people at best.
The lofty, icy Shasta, towering high above all, seems but an hour's walk from you, though the distance in an air line is about sixty miles.
Tufts of grass grow far apart here and there and small bushes of hardy sage, but they have a singed appearance and can do little to hide the blackness.
They are a portion of a flow of dense black vesicular lava, dipping northeastward at a low angle, but little changed as yet by the weather, and about as destitute of soil as a glacial pavement.
The temperature is about forty five degrees, and the height of the river above the sea is here about three thousand feet.
And the wandering winds, how busy they are, and what a breadth of sound and motion they make, glinting and bubbling about the crags of the summit, sifting through the woods, feeling their way from grove to grove, ruffling the loose hair on the shoulders of the bears, fanning and rocking young birds in their cradles, making a trumpet of every corolla, and carrying their fragrance around the world.
Thus the Shasta River issues from a large lake like spring in Shasta Valley, and about two thirds of the volume of the McCloud gushes forth in a grand spring on the east side of the mountain, a few miles back from its immediate base.
In approaching it, its suspicious looking yellow spotted hood and watchful attitude will be likely to make you go cautiously through the bog where it stands, as if you were approaching a dangerous snake.
When, therefore, they were crawling stealthily in the gloomy caverns, unkempt and begrimed and with the glare of war in their eyes, they must have seemed very demons of the volcanic pit.
The "Big Meadows" lie near the foot of Lassen's Butte, a beautiful spacious basin set in the heart of the richly forested mountains, scarcely surpassed in the grandeur of its surroundings by Tahoe.
Tracing this wild changing channel gorge, gully, or canyon, the sections will show Mount Shasta as a huge palimpsest, containing the records, layer upon layer, of strangely contrasted events in its fiery icy history.
They cover the mountains and all the lower slopes that border the wide, open valleys which abound there, pressing forward in imposing ranks, seemingly the hardiest and most firmly established of all the northern coniferae.
The nights, too, are delightful, watching with Shasta beneath the great starry dome.
The great wilds of our country, once held to be boundless and inexhaustible, are being rapidly invaded and overrun in every direction, and everything destructible in them is being destroyed.
It lies wide open for many a mile, veiled in no mystery but the mystery of light.
Only a very small portion of the water derived from the melting ice and snow of Shasta flows down its flanks on the surface.
While traveling with a company of hunters I saw about fifty in one flock.
And how grandly do the great logs and branches of your campfire give forth the heat and light that during their long century lives they have so slowly gathered from the sun, storing it away in beautiful dotted cells and beads of amber gum!
Indians usually choose to hide in tall grass and bush and behind trees, where they can crouch and glide like panthers, without casting up defenses that would betray their positions; but the Modoc castle is in the rock.
Deadly was the task of storming such a place.
One of the largest that I measured forms a lakelet nearly a hundred yards in diameter, and, in the generous flood it sends forth offers one of the most telling symbols of Nature's affluence to be found in the mountains.
Arctic beauty and desolation, with their blessings and dangers, all may be found here, to test the endurance and skill of adventurous climbers; but far better than climbing the mountain is going around its warm, fertile base, enjoying its bounties like a bee circling around a bank of flowers.
Yet, strange to say, there are days even here somewhat dull looking, when the mountain seems uncommunicative, sending out no appreciable invitation, as if not at home.
Other castles scarcely less strong are connected with this by subterranean passages known only to the Indians, while the unnatural blackness of the rock out of which Nature has constructed these defenses, and the weird, inhuman physiognomy of the whole region are well calculated to inspire terror.
One large buck that I measured stood three feet and seven inches high at the shoulders, and when the ears were extended horizontally the distance across from tip to tip was two feet and one inch.
The forest also was flooded with sun purple, not a spire moving, and Mount Shasta was seen towering above it rejoicing in the ineffable beauty of the alpenglow.
Some have strange, morbid fears as soon as they find themselves with Nature, even in the kindest and wildest of her solitudes, like very sick children afraid of their mother-as if God were dead and the devil were king.
This is where General Canby was slain while seeking to make peace with the treacherous Modocs.
Muir's Peak, a few miles to the north of the spring, rises about three thousand feet above the plain on which it stands, and is easily climbed. The view is very fine and well repays the slight walk to its summit, from which much of your way about the mountain may be studied and chosen.
Sheep Rock is about twenty miles from Sisson's, and is one of the principal winter pasture grounds of the wild sheep, from which it takes its name.
During the Glacial Period it was a mer de glace, then a lake, and now a level meadow shining with bountiful springs and streams.
But it is far better to go afoot.
It is lined with emerald algae and mosses, and shaded with alder, willow, and thorn bushes, which give it a fine setting.
These, with a few others as yet nameless, are lingering remnants of once great glaciers that occupied the canyons now taken by the rivers, and in a few centuries will, under present conditions, vanish altogether.
Should the volume of the stream where you strike it seem small, then you will know that you are above the spring; if large, nearly equal to its volume at its confluence with the Pitt River, then you are below it; and in either case have only to follow the river up or down until you come to it.
The rivers of the granite south half of the Sierra are outspread on the peaks in a shining network of small branches, that divide again and again into small dribbling, purling, oozing threads drawing their sources from the snow and ice of the surface.
The Shasta region is still a fresh unspoiled wilderness, accessible and available for travelers of every kind and degree.
Only half a dozen sheep were shot as they passed the hunters stationed near their paths circling round the rugged summit.
Would it not then be a fine thing to set it apart like the Yellowstone and Yosemite as a National Park for the welfare and benefit of all mankind, preserving its fountains and forests and all its glad life in primeval beauty? Very little of the region can ever be more valuable for any other use-certainly not for gold nor for grain.
This may be done by keeping well down on the base until fronting the glacier before beginning the ascent.
The volcanic region about Lassen's Butte I have already in part described.
In the number and size of its big spring fountains it excels even Shasta.
On our return, keeping close along shore, we caused a noisy plashing and beating of wings among cranes and geese.
One glacier after another comes into view, and the outlines of the mountain are ever changing, though all the way around, from whatever point of view, the form is maintained of a grand, simple cone with a gently sloping base and rugged, crumbling ridges separating the glaciers and the snowfields more or less completely.
This is one of the few places in California where the charming linnaea is found, though it is common to the northward through Oregon and Washington.
Mount Bremer is the most noted stronghold of the sheep in the whole Shasta region.
But look well to your footing, for the way will test the skill of the most cautious mountaineers.
The distance is about a hundred miles, and will take some of the time we hear so much about-a week or two-but the benefits will compensate for any number of weeks.
Tracing rivers to their fountains makes the most charming of travels. As the life blood of the landscapes, the best of the wilderness comes to their banks, and not one dull passage is found in all their eventful histories.
They were familiar with byways both over and under ground, and could at any time sink suddenly out of sight like squirrels among the loose boulders.
This is a famous game region, and you will be likely to meet small bands of antelope, mule deer, and wild sheep.
Two or three miles farther on is the main stronghold of the Modocs, held by them so long and defiantly against all the soldiers that could be brought to the attack.
On smooth spots, level or ascending, the hounds gained on the sheep, but on descending ground, and over rough masses of angular rocks they fell hopelessly behind.
Slight rainstorms are likely to be encountered in a trip round the mountain, but one may easily find shelter beneath well thatched trees that shed the rain like a roof.
Then fell the gloaming, making everything still more forbidding and mysterious.
She ceased as the king spoke; his livid lips did not move, and there was no recognition in his glassy eyes.
Quick-kill me, before they can trap my soul for ever!'
Do you not know me-'
'Brother!' cried Yasmina, catching his limp hand in a convulsive grasp. 'I am here!
The first speaker favored him with a long, searching stare.
Her voice died at the utter vacancy of his face.
I, whom the Kshatriyas know as Kerim Shah, a prince from Iranistan, am no greater a masquerader than most men.
'Yes.
My sister, where are you?
My soul clings to my body, but its hold weakens.
On the dais under the golden dome the king cried out again, racked by awful paroxysms.
Your cry and the grip of your fingers brought me back, but I am going fast.
'Aid me!
'The slant of the moon presaged evil for the king of Vendhya; the stars are in turmoil, the Serpent in the House of the Elephant.
'Swift!' he gasped, and his weakening voice was rational.
'Even the arts you call sorcery are governed by cosmic laws,' answered the man in the green turban.
'Only a lock of hair,' murmured the nobleman.
'Swiftly, I command you!' There was the old imperious note in his failing whisper.
All is darkness, and the roaring of great winds!'
'You have never disobeyed me-obey my last command! Send my soul clean to Asura!
'I do not know if you are a man or a demon, Khemsa,' he said at last. 'Few of us are what we seem.
'And I the Black Seers of Yimsha,' said Khemsa; 'and my masters are greater than yours, for they have accomplished by their arts what Yezdigerd could not with a hundred thousand swords.'
'Do you mean that lock of Bhunda Chand's hair?'
In another part of the city a man stood in a latticed balcony overlooking a long street in which torches tossed luridly, smokily revealing upturned dark faces and the whites of gleaming eyes.
The priests of Asura have a dim inkling of this truth, and so all nail trimmings, hair and other waste products of the persons of the royal family are carefully reduced to ashes and the ashes hidden.
He stiffened and then went limp, a grim smile curving his dead lips.
There they strove to break the silver cord of life, and thrust my soul into the body of a foul night weird their sorcery summoned up from hell.
I have been on a far journey and I understand.
All discarded portions of the human body still remain part of it, attached to it by intangible connections.
'The people know he will never see another dawn,' this man answered.
Nay, he dies and none can say why.
A low confused moan waned from his mouth.
THE PEOPLE OF THE BLACK CIRCLE
I can not find you.
Outside, the moan of the tortured thousands shuddered up to the stars which crusted the sweating Vendhyan night, and the conchs bellowed like oxen in pain.
When my masters decided upon his doom, the lock, in its golden, jewel encrusted case, was stolen from under her pillow while she slept, and another substituted, so like the first that she never knew the difference.
The slave girls at the foot of the dais whimpered with fear, and Yasmina beat her breast in anguish.
The man shrugged his broad shoulders and turned back into the arabesque chamber.
one Death Strikes a King
But the glassy blankness passed from his eyes like smoke blown from a fire, and he looked up at his sister with recognition.
A long drawn wailing rose from the multitude.
Beads of sweat glistened on his dark skin; his fingers twisted the gold worked fabric beneath him.
If they have slain the king now, why could they not have slain him months ago?'
The nobleman studied him curiously.
She threw up her head in a gusty gesture of wrath and despair as the thunder of the distant drums reached her ears.
All the noble born fighting men of Ayodhya were gathered in the great palace or about it, and at each broad arched gate and door fifty archers stood on guard, with bows in their hands.
Strike, I command you!
They seek to snap the silver cord that binds me to my dying body.
'Since his birth he has been guarded so closely that the cleverest poisoners of the East could not reach him.
'I tell you it is not poison!' she cried.
Not until the heavens were in the proper order could they perform this necromancy.' With a long, stained fingernail he mapped the constellations on the marble tiled floor.
'Brother!' she sobbed.
'The stars direct these actions, as in other affairs.
This man was clad in a brown camel hair robe and sandals, and a green turban was on his head. His expression was tranquil, his gaze impersonal.
Their fingers sear me like fire!
Then the genuine lock travelled by camel caravan up the long, long road to Peshkhauri, thence up the Zhaibar Pass, until it reached the hands of those for whom it was intended.'
Sobbing wildly, Yasmina plucked a jeweled dagger from her girdle and plunged it to the hilt in his breast.
'The priests and their clamor!' she exclaimed.
A path is opened in the unseen realms, and once a point of contact was established, mighty powers were put in play along that path.'
'I cannot!' she wailed, smiting her naked breasts.
He was young; no spear had touched him, no poison lurked in his wine.
There at least I have no doubts; for I serve King Yezdigerd of Turan.'
I am far from my mortal house!
'I know now what brings me to the pyre.
Haste, lest you damn me to spend eternity as a filthy gaunt of darkness.
Five skulls bleaching on the Tower of the Kites can testify to attempts which were made-and which failed.
He was a tall man, compactly built, and richly clad.
'Point of contact?' inquired the other.
He is dying now-and I stand here helpless, who would burn the whole city and spill the blood of thousands to save him.'
Not even my masters can alter the stars.
Ah! I feel their pull upon me now!
Through the hot, stifling night the temple gongs boomed and the conchs roared.
But his voice rose in an eery call, indistinct and far away, as if called to her from beyond vast, wind blown gulfs.
'The king is not yet dead, but the dirge is sounded,' he said to another man who sat cross legged on a mat in a corner.
'By which a soul is drawn from its body and across gulfs of echoing space,' returned the man on the mat.
So, I believe I shall go back at least for a while, and see what I can do-"
The Terran public wanted to hear about Martians, and if live Martians couldn't be found, a room full of dead ones was the next best thing.
But I think it's important that one of us go back, to present the story of our work, and what we have accomplished and what we hope to accomplish, to the public and to the universities and the learned societies, and to the Federation Government.
Well, forget it; I don't care if Bill Chandler's found a three headed hippopotamus.
Lectures.
What a question!
Martha and Selim were working in the museum on the second floor, scrubbing the grime from the glass cases, noting contents, and grease penciling numbers; Lattimer and a couple of Space Force officers were going through what had been the administrative offices on the other side.
That's where they are.
Well, of course they're dead.
Degrees, honors; the deference of the learned, and the adulation of the lay public.
They look like skeletons covered with leather.
He and Ivan Fitzgerald skinned and mounted it, and then dissected the carcass almost tissue by tissue.
Positions, with impressive titles and salaries.
The center of the room was filled by a long table; in armchairs around it sat the eighteen men and women who had occupied the room for the last fifty millennia.
At least, it was a something with wings and what were almost but not quite feathers, though it was more reptilian than avian in general characteristics.
Let the infantry do the slogging through the mud; the brass hats got the medals.
Sid, don't you get it?
"Little room, back of one of the old faculty offices-conference room.
About seven eighths of its body capacity was lungs; it certainly breathed air containing at least half enough oxygen to support human life, or five times as much as the air around Kukan.
Without question, he had become, overnight, the most widely known archaeologist in history.
"Isn't this something!" Lattimer was exulting.
"In nineteen twenty three?
They must have been all that were left, here.
Shortly afterward, the malady turned into a mild fever, from which she recovered.
Now it was burned away at both sides and lay, still hot along the edges, on the floor of the big office room in front. A floodlight was on in the room inside, and Lattimer was going around looking at things while a Space Force officer stood by the door.
She crushed out her cigarette and got to her feet.
Braziers, made of perforated two gallon odd metal cans, the white walls smudged with smoke above them.
" ... Dozen and a half of them!
We must not allow the other scientific fields and the so-called practical interests to monopolize public and academic support.
Von Ohlmhorst had noticed them at once, and was poking into one of them with his flashlight.
Bring it to the public attention; dramatize it.
That's why you had so much trouble breaking in; they'd sealed the room on the inside." He straightened and went around the room, until he found a ventilator, and peered into it.
Fitzgerald was still trying to find out how the germ had been transmitted.
"Not that I'm interested in all this, for myself," he disclaimed, after listening to the telecast from Terra two days after his discovery.
No, I do not know what they died of.
Skeletons covered with leather, Gloria Standish had called them, and so they were-faces like skulls, arms and legs like sticks, the flesh shrunken onto the bones under it.
dr von Ohlmhorst!" he was shouting.
Four hundred miles from Kukan, and at fifteen thousand feet lower altitude, he shot a bird.
"Mass suicide, that's what it was.
"Yes; charcoal.
Immediately, Sid Chamberlain and Gloria Standish began giving their telecasts a Kukan dateline, and Hubert Penrose used the name in his official reports.
The discovery of the University had focused attention on the dead past of Mars; now the public was interested in Mars as a possible home for humanity.
The organization of a Society of Martian Archaeology, with Anthony Lattimer, p h d, the logical candidate for the chair.
She slammed the phone back on its hook, rushing away ahead of them.
"Where?" they asked together.
It was Tony Lattimer who brought archaeology back into the activities of the expedition and the news at home.
Another had fallen forward onto the table, arms extended, the emerald set of a ring twinkling dully on one finger.
The civilian specialists in other fields, and the Space Force people who had been holding tape lines and making sketches and snapping cameras, were all flying to lower Syrtis to find out how much oxygen there was and what kind of life it supported.
They located the city, and learned that its name had been Kukan-or something with a similar vowel consonant ratio.
Martha remembered the closed door; on the first survey, they hadn't attempted opening it.
Sid and Gloria made the most of it.
Gloria Standish, who had dropped in for lunch, was on the mezzanine, fairly screaming into a radiophone extension:
Notice what's in the corners?"
"Over on the north side." The lieutenant took hold of himself and spoke more deliberately.
Selim dropped his rag back in the bucket; she laid her clipboard on top of the case beside her.
Eighteen of them, around a long table-"
"Hey, Martha!
Maybe an even better thing; it had been only sixty odd years since the Orson Welles invasion scare.
"I'd hoped it would be you; your voice would carry the most weight.
So they just came in here and lit the charcoal, and sat drinking together till they all fell asleep.
The high point came when one party, at thirty thousand feet below the level of Kukan, found breathable air.
It was one of these, a young second lieutenant, who came hurrying in from the mezzanine, almost bursting with excitement.
Sweet are the uses of publicity.
Nobody else seemed to have caught it.
Sometimes Sachiko dropped in; most of the time she was busy helping Ivan Fitzgerald dissect specimens.
And, for a while, it was easier to get financial support for new excavations.
That took the center of interest away from archaeology, and started a new burst of activity.
The daily newscasts from Terra showed a corresponding shift in interest at home.
"Male or female? Human or animal?"
Bud Barclay, a dark haired young flier and Tom Swift Jr's closest friend, chuckled.
Then Tom, who had been stunned by some falling debris, raised himself to a sitting position.
Bud threw up his arms to protect himself, but too late!
Suddenly Tom stiffened in fear.
Tom nodded unhappily.
mr Swift's eyes twinkled.
Dazed and panic stricken survivors were wandering around aimlessly or rushing about to assist the injured.
"Tough break," Tom sympathized.
His friend's eyelids flickered.
"I was all set for Sandy's cool soothing touch on my fevered brow!"
"Anyhow, we want to help.
"A visitor?" Tom looked at his father.
"A pity.
"As you know, Tom," mr Faber began, "the usual conditions of rocket flight will be-"
Let's see about getting help for mr Faber!"
With a desperate heave, he shoved the beam away, then cradled Bud's head in his arm.
Sandy, to take her brother's mind off the disaster, said, "Dad, tell Tom and Bud about the visitor who's coming."
"Right where we landed our Whirling Duck!"
The scientist seemed to be badly injured.
The answer came in a groan.
"Look!" Tom pointed to a huge crevasse.
Wow!...
"Why did you have to go and spoil it?" he complained jokingly.
Or grazed, at least," Tom added thankfully.
"Why, one of the ambulance doctors checked us out."
Bud seized a slender, steel I beam and managed to pry up the wreckage while Tom carefully extricated mr Faber.
The helicopter arrived within twenty minutes at the place Tom had named. After landing at Enterprises, the boys drove to the pleasant, tree shaded Swift home on the outskirts of town.
"What a relief!" Sandy gasped.
The walls and roof were shuddering and creaking, and the concrete floor was heaving under their feet.
Electronic equipment cascaded from the wall shelves, and a heavy duty chain hoist came loose from its overhead track, plunging to the floor with a terrifying crash.
"mr Faber is badly injured," Tom said.
From a pay telephone, he called Swift Enterprises in Shopton.
Within minutes, Tom was in charge of clearing away rubble and extricating anyone who might be trapped inside the buildings. Bud organized a fire fighting crew to keep the blaze in the shed from spreading.
After the two boys had showered and changed their clothes, mrs Swift served them a delicious, hot meal.
For minutes, no one stirred among the wreckage.
Two hours later there was nothing more Tom and Bud could do at the disaster scene and they hitched a ride into Harkness.
He broke off with a gasp of astonishment as the whole building suddenly began to shake.
Tom laughed.
"I'm so thankful you're both safe!" she murmured.
Both boys were amazed and excited.
The two boys followed mr Faber and his engineers to a wooden building which was tightly guarded.
The boys found a first aid cabinet and gave what help they could to them and the other two men.
"No use fussing about it now," Tom said.
What hit me?"
"We grow 'em tough out in California where I come from!" he joked.
"Don't worry, Sis.
"Right!" Bud responded.
"Hope you can find out what's wrong."
Power lines were down and an outlying storage shed was ablaze.
Only two thirds of the walls were still standing.
Another engineer rushed toward the door to see what was happening outside.
"We heard a bulletin about the quake over the radio!"
He's a great scientist."
"This isn't part of your testing routine, is it?"
Of the four other company engineers, two were now stirring and partly conscious.
The eighteen year old inventor accepted the challenge with a smile. "I'll be glad to try, sir," he replied.
He also called home and spoke to his sister, Sandra.
"Come on, Bud!
The two girls were as much upset as Tom's mother.
The telephone line was soon repaired and a steady stream of rescue vehicles began arriving from Harkness-fire trucks, three ambulances, and private cars driven by volunteers.
"mr Faber!" he gasped.
He had heard about the great San Francisco earthquake from his grandfather, and had no doubt about the nature of the tremors.
"Good grief!" Bud exclaimed.
Phyl, a pretty, dark haired girl, was the daughter of mr Swift's long-time friend and business associate, "Uncle Ned" Newton.
"Wow!" Bud gasped.
"The center of the quake was right under Faber Electronics," Tom remarked.
"Good night!" Tom's eyes focused in horror on the wreckage enveloped by still billowing dust.
"From another planet," mr Swift revealed.
"None of those," he replied as the boys stared, mystified.
While they ate, mr Swift managed after some difficulty to get a call through to the Harkness Hospital. His face was grave as he hung up.
A falling beam caught him on the back of the head and the young flier blacked out.
"Let's see if we can find a telephone and call the local hospital," Tom said.
They picked their way through the wreckage and emerged on a scene of frightful destruction.
Tom asked the operator to send a helicopter immediately to pick them up.
"Why not send a car?
"Mark Faber is not expected to live," the elder inventor reported.
"You got conked by a falling timber.
Got a job for us?"
The boys exchanged rueful glances as they realized that the craft which had brought them to Faber Electronics-one of Tom's unique helijets-had been swallowed up in the gaping chasm.
"We're not stretcher cases," he said.
"Tom, we're having a problem with the gyro stabilizer," said Mark Faber, gray haired president of the Faber Electronics Company.
Then Tom taped a bandage on Bud's scalp wound.
The test stand's breaking loose!" Tom warned.
Before he reached it, another shock knocked all of them off their feet.
"The roof! It's caving in!" he heard someone scream.
"I tried to assure them that you and Bud can take care of yourselves in any crisis." He smiled guiltily as he added, "But I must admit I was more than a little concerned myself."
Disregarding his own injuries, Tom hastily freed himself from the debris and groped his way to Bud's side.
"If anyone can get the bugs out of your new invention, genius boy here will do it!"
"Look out!
The town had suffered some damage, though only slight compared to the destruction at the plant.
The main plant building of Faber Electronics had been partially demolished by the quake.
"Are you all right?" Tom asked fearfully.
"If that beam had landed square on your noggin, even a rock head like you couldn't have survived!"
Despite the chaotic confusion, the boys managed to locate the plant superintendent-a harried, middle aged man named Simkins-who was doing his best to restore order.
Inside, a secret rocket telemetering device was mounted on its test stand.
It's only a few miles away, isn't it?"
Tell Mother and Dad that we're okay," Tom said. "We'll be home in a jiffy-with big appetites!"
"Good thing the main shift of workers knocked off before this happened," Bud observed with a shudder.
mrs Swift, a slender, petite woman, tried not to show concern when she saw the boys, bruised and disheveled.
"An earthquake!" Tom gasped.
Somewhat shakily, Bud got to his feet with Tom's assistance.
The two boys scrambled through the clutter of debris toward the spot where the test stand had been erected.
"We'd better not try to move him," Tom decided.
"There would've been a lot more casualties."
At the end of it she was in a place of tombs.
It is nothing.
Even if he were alive, her heart was past being moved.
CHAPTER twelve.
She knew nothing of the place, had nowhere to go, nowhere she wanted to go, had not a thought to tell her what question to ask, if she met a living soul.
"He is dead.
It was all deadness.
"She is nothing to me.
That night, and every night until the dust was laid to the dust, Mary slept well; and through the days she had great composure; but, when the funeral was over, came a collapse and a change.
The universe was sunk in one of the dreams that haunt the sleep of death; and, if these were ghosts at all, they were ghosts walking in their sleep.
If I speak to her, she is not there.
How could she? She had not seen Christ rise; she had never looked upon one of the dead; never heard a voice from the other bank; had received no certain testimony.
Terror and a dismay indescribable seized her; she turned and fled back to the company of her kind.
Oh, cold creatures, ye are not what ye seem, and I will none of you!"
Of a sudden a great splendor burst upon her, and through her eyelids she was struck blind-blind with light and not with darkness, for all was radiance about her.
But not a throb went through her heart.
I am nothing.
She was one of a large company at a house where she had never been before-a beautiful house with a large garden behind.
Then came the form of her mother, and bent over that of her brother from behind.
He came to her side, and she gave him no greeting.
All day the wind had been out.
Through the moonlight they led her from the city, and over fields, and through valleys, and across rivers and seas-a long journey; nor did she grow weary, for there was not life enough in her to be made weary.
She was out of place, and much unwelcome.
She found herself at length in an avenue of dark trees, the end of which was far off.
That night was the first herald of the coming winter, and blew a cold blast from his horn.
Her only life was, that she was lost.
But for a long time she sought the house in vain; she could not reach it; the avenue seemed interminable to her feet returning.
No carriage rolled along the center, no footfarer walked on the side.
Everything is an empty dream of loss.
And the voice said, "Poor child! something has closed the valve between her heart and mine." With that came a pang of intense pain.
The loss, the evanishment, the ceasing, were incontrovertible-the only incontrovertible things: she was sure of them: could she be sure of anything else?
Her whole consciousness was merest, all but abstract, loss.
But she neither loved the light nor mourned the shadow.
Every now and then she came on a little group, or met a party of the guests, as she walked, but none spoke to her, or seemed to see her, and she spoke to none.
At last she fell asleep, and in a moment was dreaming diligently.
I know it, and there is no waking.
But the dead, one of them seized one of her hands, and another the other.
If for a moment a thing looked the same as before, she wondered vaguely, unconsciously, how it could be.
The smell of the linen, of the blue cloth, and of the brown paper-things no longer to be handled by those tender, faithful hands-was dismal and strange, and haunted her like things that intruded, things which she had done with, and which yet would not go away.
Death was a fact.
The dead never spoke to her, and she never spoke to them.
Thus was she borne away captive of her dead, neither willing nor unwilling, of life and death equally careless.
She was like a fish in a sea of light.
The old time was but a thicker dream, and this is truer because more shadowy." And, the form still standing by her, she felt it was ages away; she was divided from it by a gulf of very nothingness.
This is a LibriVox recording.
"Shall we walk along the Embankment, or go somewhere on the Underground?"
I haven't answered her letter."
Well, it was not too late.
This preamble sent a shiver of dread down her spine.
She would have shared his sorrow, and shown herself "half wife, half angel from heaven" in this dark hour.
"Well?" she said.
It was on the tip of her tongue to say that she would stand by him whatever he had done; but if he had married someone else this would be improper, so she only said, "Well?" and she said it coldly.
Her tears were falling hot and fast between face and veil, for she had talked till she was very sorry indeed for herself.
No, it's all over-you've broken my heart and destroyed my faith in human nature. I hope I shall never see you again.
They did not speak again till they had gone through the little back streets, past the police station and the mustard factory, and were on the broad pavement of Queen Victoria Street.
"Let's go out," he said.
Following the tingle of relief came a sharp, sickening pinch of jealousy and mortification.
What opinion would he form of the purity of her mind, the innocence of her soul, if an incident like this failed to shock her deeply?
How warm it would have been in the orchard!
"Never," she said, her eyes flashing through her tears.
The setting of the scene seemed to her all important.
Her dress was brown, her jacket black, and her hat was home trimmed.
She herself should have been a poem-a lyric in a white gown and green scarf, coming to him through the long grass under the blossomed boughs.
But how?
So she said-
Some great sorrow had come to him.
When she did her words did not fit the mouth of the girl in the orchard-but then it would have been May there, and this was January.
"Yes.
And it's good bye for ever. No-it's only painful for both of us.
"Look here, darling, I've got something to tell you, and I hope to God you'll forgive me and stand by me, and try to understand that I love you just the same, and whatever happens I shall always love you."
As the confession of a crime she must receive it.
He loved her with all his heart, and he, also, had what she had never suspected in him-the literary sense.
He had never been like this before.
This really was a master stroke of nobility.
"Yes, isn't it?" he said.
She could begin now.
She had grown anxious, as the one who waits always does, and she was extremely glad to see him, but she knew that a late lover should be treated with a provoking coldness (one can relent prettily later on), so she gave him a limp hand and no greeting.

And she had been sulking!
She could have snapped off a blossoming branch and-and made play with it somehow.
"I'm freezing," she said suddenly; "let's go and have some tea."
But here-the only thing that occurred to her was to stop and look in one of the shops till he should ask her what she was looking at.
The fine tact of a noble woman seemed to have deserted her.
He had asked her to meet him at Cannon Street; he had something to say to her, and at home it was difficult to get a quiet half hour because of her little sisters.
"Do you think I'm not sorry now?"
Those four true words wounded her more than all the rest.
"Oh, the Embankment, please!" and felt a sting of annoyance and disappointment when he acquiesced.
She drew a deep breath.
At home she could at least have buried her face in the sofa cushions and resisted all his pleading,--at last, perhaps, letting him take one cold passive hand and shower frantic kisses upon it.
Yet perhaps, after all, that is not because of the literary sense. It may be because she loved him.
And the fact that she was to meet him at Cannon Street Station would almost, she feared, make the meeting itself banal, sordid.
What was it, compared with her fears?
She almost said, "Never mind, dear.
He checked the silly impulse.
Yet she must speak.
How should she know that he had only told her because he feared that she would anyhow hear it through the indiscretion of the girl in pink, or of that other girl in blue who had seen and smiled?
He had been late: he had offered no excuse, no explanation.
She had, to the full limit allowed of her reading and her environment, the literary sense.
She only wished for May and the orchard, instead of January and the dingy, dusty waiting room, the plain faced, preoccupied travellers, the dim, desolate weather.
There's no more to be said; you've betrayed me.
How could she guess that he had tuned his confession to the key of what he believed would be an innocent girl's estimate of his misconduct?
I can't bear to see you looking so miserable," and there was another silence.
These inspired her.
The girl in the orchard would have known at a glance.
She had done the proper thing; she had awaited these with dignified reserve, and now she was involved in the meshes of a silence that she could not break. How easy it would have been in the orchard!
Because Destiny is almost without the literary sense, and Destiny carelessly decreed that he should die of enteric in a wretched hut, without so much as hearing a gun fired.
No-it's no use-I can never, never forgive you-and it's all over.
He ought to insist on the railway carriage: he probably would.
"How frightfully cold it is!"
"You've deceived me once-you'd do it again!
But how could he go back to say, "We are parting for ever; but still, I must insist on the sad pleasure of paying for our tea-for the last time"?
Seated at a marble table-the place was nearly empty-she furtively watched his face in the glass, and what she saw there thrilled her.
She stole a glance at him, and for the first time it occurred to her that his "something to say" was not a mere excuse for being alone with her. He had something to say-something that was trying to get itself said. The keen wind thrust itself even inside the high collar of her jacket. Her hands and feet were aching with cold.
He came towards her; he was five minutes late.
It was a very good exit.
Then he would have had to say something.
He stood up suddenly.
All LibriVox recordings are in the public domain.
The time should have been May.
As soon as the two were alone again he leaned his elbows on the marble and spoke.
She would have liked to meet him in some green, cool orchard, where daffodils swung in the long grass, and primroses stood on frail stiff little pink stalks in the wet, scented moss of the hedgerow.
I'm only talking as I know good girls ought to talk"?
"Go home and gloat over it all!
I didn't think a decent man could do such things." She was pulling on her gloves.
"Forgive me, dear," he said.
He had told her of the thing as one tells of a crime.
He himself was evidently a prey to the most rending remorse.
"You know I do," he said; "it was hateful of me-but I couldn't help it."
He would hardly have known her in green and white muslin and an orchard, for their love had been born and bred in town-Highbury New Park, to be exact.
At the corner he remembered that he had gone away without paying for the tea, and his natural impulse was to go back and remedy that error.
And how common and mean that would be compared with the blossoming bough; and besides, the shops they were passing had nothing in the windows except cheap pastry and models of steam engines.
SHE was going to meet her lover.
He could not say, "And so I am, on the whole," which was what he thought.
"Of course, if you like," he said uncomfortably; yet she could see he was glad that she had broken that desolate silence.
Then how can I ever trust you?
"You don't love me-you've never loved me-I was an idiot to believe you did."
You see that she knew exactly how a tryst is conducted in the pages of the standard poets and of the cheaper weekly journals.
"Couldn't help it?
Good bye!"
Then she rose to the occasion.
It was bitterly cold, but the Embankment was more romantic than a railway carriage.
BY e NESBIT
He would come to morrow, however, and then- At present the thing to compass was a dignified parting.
And, curiously enough, she was hardly curious at all about what he might have to say.
Her hands should have been full of bluebells, and she should have held them up to his face in maidenly defence as he sprang forward to take her in his arms.
Why on earth didn't he speak?
He stood up suddenly.
The waitress brought the two thick cups of tea, and looked at him with a tepid curiosity.
"Are you really going to throw me over for a thing like this?"
"Good bye," she said; "I'm going home.
The anger in his eyes frightened her, and the misery of his face wrung her heart; but how could she say-
Even if we were married I could never be sure you weren't kissing some horrid girl or other.
What had he done-a murder-a bank robbery-married someone else?
"Then good bye," he said, "and may God forgive you as I do!" And he strode down between the marble tables and out by the swing door.
So she waited for him in vain, and at last paid for the tea herself, and went home to wait there-and there, too, in vain, for he never came back to her.
"Do you mean it?" he said, and his tone should have warned her.
Oh, Ethel, do try to forgive me!
So she said-
"It serves me right," she said in excellent, yet unfamiliar, English.
"Go on," he said, "tell me all about it."
I feel as if I had been beaten."
Do drink this, and then tell me.
I was thinking of French.
It was plain that his castanet girl-his mother and sister took a pleasure in crediting her daily with some fresh and unpleasing instrument-could have had neither taste, money, nor honesty to such a point as this.
I am sure you meant to be kind." And then she began to cry again.
"American heiresses are expected to marry English dukes," he said, with a distinct physical pain at his heart.
She rose.
Again that strange hesitation-then quite suddenly the girl put her hands up to her face and began to cry.
The performer was evidently singing "under her voice," but the effect was charming.
"I shall lock up all the doors and windows in the house-and then I shall give you my latch key, and you can let yourself in and stay the night here-there is no one in the house.
She turned quickly, and came back two steps.
"All the same," he added irrelevantly, "you shall have the latch key."
"Look here," he said, "this is all nonsense, you know.
You see, papa's so very rich, and at home they expect me to-to get acquainted with dukes and things-and-"
"Won't you sing again?" he asked.
Then there was silence-then a sigh, and the sound of light moving feet on the gravel.
She looked at him and spoke for the first time.
She laughed.
There had been five organs since dinner-and seven in the afternoon-one and all urgently thumping their heavy melodies into his brain, to the confusion of the thoughts that waited there, eager to marshal themselves, orderly and firm, into the phalanx of an article on "The Decadence of Criticism."
I'm poor, too."
"So it's your destiny to marry a duke, is it?" the young man spoke slowly.
"Aren't you tired?" he said.
She spent the rest of that day in searching the house for further losses, but all things were in their place, except the silver handled button hook-and that, as even his sister owned, had been missing for months.
"Well, then, I went into lodgings; that wicked woman had left me one street suit-and to day they turned me out because my money was all gone.
"Wouldn't you like to sit down and rest? There is a seat in the garden at the side of the house."
He went into the dining room, dark with mahogany and damask, found wine and cake in the sideboard cupboard, put them on a tray, and took them out through the garden door and round to the corner where, almost sheltered by laburnums and hawthorns from the view of the people next door, the singer and her guitar rested on the iron seat.
He stood with his hand on the curtain, listening-and with a pleasure that astonished him.
Never had any act seemed so impossible.
She held out a pair of little patent leather shoes, very worn and dusty-the slender silken web of a black stocking, brown with dust, hung from her hand.
"I have brought you some wine-will you have it?"
The hotel folks let her go-I can't think how people can be so silly.
Let me go-thank you very much.
He filled his pipe, drew paper towards him, dipped his pen, and wrote his title on the blank page.
It would have turned out all right with them.
He reflected a moment.
Her little foot tapped the gravel impatiently.
I might have known I couldn't do it, though it's just what girls in books would do.
"I don't understand a single word you say!
"You don't know how horrid everyone has been.
The only excuse for this rash young man is to be found in the fact that while he was feeding his strange guest with cake and wine she was feeding, with her beauty, the first fire of his first love.
Then it was taken away.
After all, it was a "quiet neighbourhood" as the advertisement had said-at any rate, in the evening: and in the evening a man's best efforts-
You've quarrelled with your friends, and-Ah, tell me-and let me try to help you."
He hurriedly cut cake and pressed it upon her.
and so forth.
And I've been at it since five o'clock-and I've only got one shilling and seven pence.
And he sat there thinking, till his mother's voice roused him.
"Here!" he called to the figure that moved slowly towards the gate.
Oh, Lord!"
The young man drew a deep breath of relief, and lighted the wax candles in the solid silver candlesticks on his writing table, for now the late summer dusk was falling, and that organ, please Heaven, made full the measure of the day's appointed torture.
"An adventuress!
He threw back the curtain and leaned out of the window.
Perhaps I can help you."
"Let me think," he said.
Here, signorina, ecco, prendi-vino-gatto-No, gatto's a cat.
Then we will see what can be done."
THE last strains of the ill treated, ill fated "Intermezzo" had died away, and after them had died away also the rumbling of the wheels of the murderous barrel organ that had so gaily executed that, along with the nine other tunes of its repertory, to the admiration of the housemaid at the window of the house opposite, and the crowing delight of the two babies next door.
I told you so!" said his mother at once-and the young man sat down at his study table and looked at the title of his article on "The Decadence of Criticism." It was surely a very long time ago that he had written that.
He sprang to his feet-this was, indeed, too much!
What is it?
She drank obediently.
She hesitated, then struck a chord or two and began another of those little tuneful Italian songs, all stars and flowers and hearts of gold. And again he listened with a quiet pleasure.
"Of course he didn't.
Then she turned towards the quarter indicated and disappeared round the laurel bushes.
"Here-I say, you know-don't-" he said.
I will catch the night train, and bring my mother up to morrow.
He did not kiss it then, only took it in his, and felt how small and cold it was.
He answered nothing.
"It wasn't I who said that," said the girl, smiling; "but that's so, anyhow." And then she sighed.
He had no time to think, but he was aware that this was the most exciting adventure that had ever happened to him.
The half dozen pairs of embroidered silk stockings and the dainty French silver buckled shoes, which arrived a month later addressed to Miss ----, Hill View Villa, only confirmed their distrust.
She wore the dress of a Contadina, a very smart dress indeed, and her hands looked small and white.
Again she hesitated.
"But don't you know anyone in London?" he asked in a sensible postscript.
Why, that's nothing.
Love at first sight is all nonsense, we know-we who have come to forty year-but at twenty one one does not somehow recognise it for the nonsense it is.
She stopped short, and looked at him through the dusk.
"I'm coming to that," she said.
Her eyes filled again with tears.
I have only told you enough to teach you how to look for yourselves; a peep, you know, is all I promised you.
The thought came to them that it might be prepared from coal, and conducted through pipes to our houses to take the place of lamps or candles, which until that time had been the only light.
At first, you know, they will only play.
It is this earth on which we live.
Don't you see how many uses we have found for this refuse coal tar?
A PEEP INTO ONE OF GOD'S STOREHOUSES
Of course they would explore and explore; try every panel, and press every spring, until, one by one, all the closets should be opened, and all the treasures brought out.
Besides the dyes, we shall also have left naphtha, useful in making varnish, and various oils that are used in more ways than I can stop to tell you, or you would care now to hear.
This served for a hint to curious men, to make them ask "What is this?" and "What is it good for?" and so at last, following their questions, to find their way to the secret stores, and make an open doorway, and let the world in.
These forests were of trees, different in some ways from those we have now, great ferns as tall as this house, and mosses as high as little trees, and palm leaves of enormous size.
Look a little closer, while our guide lets the light of his lamp fall upon the black wall at your side.
Let us look at them; for perhaps we can examine them more closely than we can the roof, and the sides of these halls.
If she does, you are indebted again to the coal oil, for of that it is partly made.
The doorway of this storehouse lies in the side of a hill.
The least they could do would be to try to use every thing for the purposes intended, and not to destroy or injure any of the precious gifts prepared so lovingly for their use.
The floors were carpeted with velvet, and the whole was lighted with lamps that shone like stars from above.
How did it happen, and what does it mean?
See, beneath your feet is the marking of great tree trunks lying aslant across the floor, and the forms of gigantic palm leaves strewed among them.
So this great green hill, upon which you might run or play, is inside like what I think some of those large anthills must be,--traversed by galleries, and full of rooms and long passages.
Here is something different, rounded like a nut shell; you can split off one side, and behold there is the nut lying snugly as does any chestnut in its bur!
Do you see the delicate tracery of ferns, more beautiful than the fairest drawing.
But here is another surprise of a different kind.
What do you think of that from the coal tar.
When your hands or lips are cracked and rough from the cold, does your mother ever put on glycerin to heal them?
But do you imagine that sensible children, after one such discovery, would rest satisfied?
We shall need a guide; and here comes one,--a rough looking man, with smutty clothes, and an odd little lamp covered with wire gauze, fastened to the front of his cap.
Did you notice the great pillars of coal that are left to uphold the roof?
And then how could they show their gratitude to the dear father who had taken such pains to prepare this wonderful house for them?
Why did he give that so odd a shape, or so strange a covering?
And so through many questions, and many experiments, they learn at last how to use the contents of this one storehouse.
And so it began to be used to cover roofs of buildings, and, mixed with some other substances, made a pavement for streets; and being spread over iron work it protected it from rust.
But you will find that they are really pulled and pushed by an engine that stands outside the doorway and reaches them by long chains.
Now, I can very well remember when I first saw a coal fire, and how odd it looked to see what seemed to be burning stones.
If you have not, perhaps you would like to go with me to examine one that was opened a good many years ago, but contains such valuable things that the uses of all of them have not yet been found out, and their beauty is just beginning to be known.
All about we see men like our guide, working by the light of their little lamps.
Ferns and palms, mosses and trees and animals, all perfect, all beautiful, and yet all hidden away under this hill, and turned into shining black coal.
The sweetest perfumes floated through the air, while thousands of birds answered the music of fountains with their songs.
What should we have done, if everybody had kept on burning wood to this day?
The entrance is light, because it opens so wide; but we can see that the floor slopes downward, and the way looks dark and narrow before us.
Once there was a father who thought he would build for his children a beautiful home, putting into it every thing they could need or desire throughout their lives.
As it floated on the surface of the water (for oil and water will not mix, you know), the boys, for mischief, set fire to it, and a stream of fire rolled along down the river; proving to everybody who saw it, that a new light, as good as gas, had come from the coal.
Here are mosses and little leaves, and sometimes an odd looking little body that is not unlike some of the sea creatures we found at the beach last summer; and every thing is made of coal, nothing but coal.
"Is it Robert?" whispered Glenarvan.
All escape was thus hopeless, and Glenarvan having tried the walls for the twentieth time, was compelled to acknowledge that it was so.
CHAPTER twelve STRANGELY LIBERATED
Wilson and Olbinett joined their companions, and all united to dig through the wall-john with his dagger, the others with stones taken from the ground, or with their nails, while Mulrady, stretched along the ground, watched the native guard through a crevice of the matting.
"I did not speak for ourselves," said Glenarvan.
It was evidently the cue of both sides to be silent.
But softly as the name was breathed, Mary Grant, already awakened by the sounds in the hut, slipped over toward Glenarvan, and seizing the hand, all stained with earth, she covered it with kisses.
Robert disappeared through the opening out of the grotto.
I am not an advocate of irremediable measures."
Had they been seen?
Neither moon nor stars pierced the gloom.
john Mangles, before leaving the hut, disposed of all the evidences of their work, and in his turn slipped through the opening and let down over it the mats of the house, so that the entrance to the gallery was quite concealed.
The hours of this night, wretched as they were, slipped away.
Glenarvan, holding with one hand to a tuft of tetragonia, with the other holding his wife, waited with breathless anxiety.
Some minutes more passed, and the Major withdrew his hand from the stroke of a sharp blade.
"This rope," said he, "will only bear the weight of two persons; therefore let us go in rotation.
"Animal or man," answered the Major, "I will soon find out!"
Suddenly a terrific yell from a hundred throats rent the air.
He was now the object of their anxiety, and whose absence was a black shadow between them and their happiness.
But they all kept watchful guard on the hut confided to their care.
Glenarvan's voice, firm till now, faltered.
"Watch the savages outside," said Robert.
"There are only four awake; the rest are asleep."
While they looked they were seen.
Lady Helena repeated the evening prayer aloud, her companions, bare headed, repeated it after her.
"I discovered a deep hollow at the foot of the slope where those who come down can conceal themselves and wait for the rest."
"I will go first," said Robert.
If it is decreed that we die to morrow, let us die bravely, like Christian men, ready to appear without terror before the Supreme Judge.
Thick darkness had settled on the mountain.
"My darling Robert," said she, never doubting, "it is you! it is you!"
Soon they had reached a height of five hundred feet above Lake Taupo, and the cold of the morning, increased by the altitude, was very keen.
This done, the prisoners embraced each other.
God, who reads our hearts, knows that we had a noble end in view.
"Listen," said he, motioning them to stoop.
The prisoners redoubled their efforts.
The escape was commenced, and every precaution was taken.
"Be it as it may, we can face death!
"Yes, john; but we are unarmed."
The soil was light and friable, and below lay a bed of silicious tufa; therefore, even without tools, the aperture deepened quickly.
I stole this knife and rope out of the desert hut.
Let us attack these wretches!' But with these poor girls-"
The meal ended.
We must show these savages how Europeans can die."
After these words were said, a profound silence ensued.
"Wherever Paganel is, he cannot be in worse plight than ourselves.
Who does not turn his thoughts toward God in the hour of death?
They had one night in which to prepare for death.
Another half an hour and the glorious sun would rise out of the mists of the horizon.
The jailer may forget that he is on guard; the prisoner never forgets that he is guarded.
"I believe," said john, "that in the sight of God I have a right to fulfill that promise."
But the fugitives could not doubt that their escape had been discovered; and now the question was, would they be able to elude pursuit?
At last the sun appeared and sent his first rays on their path.
Then Glenarvan, taking his friends aside, said: "My dear friends, our lives and the lives of these poor women are in God's hands.
"No, my Lord!" said Robert, taken aback by the disappearance of his friend Paganel.
The captive thinks oftener of escaping than the jailer of preventing his flight, and hence we hear of frequent and wonderful escapes.
The misty summits began to pierce the morning mists.
My Lord, whichever of us survives the other will fulfill the wish of Lady Helena and Mary Grant."
The scratching became more and more audible; they could hear the little stones grate on a hard body and roll away.
"Is Paganel below?" asked Glenarvan.
Then Glenarvan going first and supporting his wife, began to descend backward.
Then shaking his head like one who sees he is mistaken, he went back to his companions, took an armful of dead wood, and threw it into the smouldering fire, which immediately revived.
john signaled to Glenarvan to resume his descent.
"Brave lad!" repeated Glenarvan.
Round his body was rolled a long coil of flax rope.
Sleep, which keeps all sorrow in abeyance, soon weighed down their eyelids; they slept in each other's arms, overcome by exhaustion and prolonged watching.
Glenarvan first, then Lady Helena, let themselves down along the rope, till they came to the spot where the perpendicular wall met the top of the slope.
The next thing was to descend the vertical wall to the slope below, and this would have been impracticable, but that Robert had brought the flax rope, which was now unrolled and fixed to a projecting point of rock, the end hanging over.
They had to fly.
Dim outlines of hills and mountains rose behind one another; but Glenarvan only thought how best to get lost among them. Time enough by and by to see about escaping from the labyrinth.
"My child, my child," murmured Lady Helena, "the savages did not kill you!"
Paganel was not there to take the lead.
john Mangles, inserting the blade of his poniard, avoided the knife which now protruded above the soil, but seized the hand that wielded it.
"Well, lose no more time," said the Major.
Where chance led them, but at any rate they were free.
Lord and Lady Glenarvan first; when they arrive at the bottom, three pulls at the rope will be a signal to us to follow."
They had reached half-way down the slope, when a voice was heard from the opening of the grotto.
Overcome as they were with horror and fatigue, they took their last meal together.
At this moment john raised the mat, and counted twenty five natives keeping guard on the Ware Atoua.
"Yes, little sister," said he, "it is I am here to save you all; but be very silent."
Glenarvan struck his forehead.
Glenarvan and Lady Helena immediately ventured out of the grotto.
"No, Robert!" answered Mary Grant.
It soon became evident that a man, or men, clinging to the sides of the "pah," were cutting a passage into its exterior wall.
Stern as the decree may seem, I will not repine.
Let us go."
Toward five o'clock, the day began to dawn, bluish clouds marbled the upper stratum of clouds.
Did you not get away together?"
"john, you have promised Mary what I promised Lady Helena.
"No, my Lord; but is he not here?" inquired Robert.
The rope was shaken three times, and in his turn john Mangles, preceding Mary Grant, followed in the dangerous route.
One of the warriors on guard, startled by an unusual sound, rose and drew nearer to the Ware Atoua.
Besides, a thick veil of fog, which, spread at his feet, prevented any distinct view of the valleys below.
They walked quickly, trying to avoid the points where they might be seen from the pah.
He was silent a moment, and having overcome his emotion, he said, addressing the young captain:
But death here, means not death only, it means torture, insult, perhaps, and here are two ladies-"
"Go, my boy," said Glenarvan, pressing Robert's hand.
She felt stronger and commenced her perilous descent.
john Mangles, before his friends trusted themselves to this flax rope, tried it; he did not think it very strong; and it was of importance not to risk themselves imprudently, as a fall would be fatal.
Some birds, suddenly awakened, flew away, uttering feeble cries, and the fugitives trembled when a stone loosened from its bed rolled to the foot of the mountain.
It was the hand of a woman or child, a European!
It came from the pah, whose direction Glenarvan did not know.
"Let us be off!" said he, in a decided tone.
We ought to have seen the lights of Auckland thirty six hours ago."
Their minds were so distracted at this change of route as to be quite unhinged.
Our lives would be worth little.
However, for that day at least, the yacht did not appear, and the sixth night from their departure from Twofold Bay came, without the fears of john Mangles being realized.
We would fight to the death, of course, but after that!
Their friends did their best to amuse them.
Besides, they were going to this new and ill reputed country without enthusiasm, without conviction, not even of their own free will, but solely at the bidding of destiny.
Think of Lady Glenarvan; think of Mary Grant!"
"And yet," said the young captain, "you must be longing to quit this vessel.
"john, my heart is broken; and sometimes despair nearly masters me.
"Why, john?"
"Look more to starboard."
Glenarvan shook his head in dissent.
"What then, my Lord?"
But as to getting alongside the DUNCAN!
Much as they had been interested in his dissertation on the Pampas, or Australia, his lectures on New Zealand fell on cold and indifferent ears.
STILL this wearisome voyage dragged on.
"You, my Lord?"
john came up to him and said, "Your Lordship is looking out for land?"
"It must be here on these coasts, skimming these very waves, playing the vile part of a pirate! It is here, john; I am certain of it, on the track of vessels between Australia and New Zealand; and I have a presentiment that we shall fall in with her."
"My yacht! the DUNCAN," said Glenarvan, hotly.
He could not stay in one place.
"God keep us from such a meeting!"
God forbid!
Then they returned to the narrow space, fitter for stowing cargo than accommodating passengers, especially ladies.
Will Halley is a brute, but I am keeping my eyes open, and if the coast looks dangerous, I will put the ship's head to sea again. So that, on that score, there is little or no danger.
We should be taken, delivered up to the mercy of those wretches, and Ben Joyce has shown us that he does not stop at a crime!
"I am not looking for the land."
They often braved the weather, and went on the poop till driven down again by the force of a sudden squall.
"Poor girls!" murmured Glenarvan.
"Keep up your heart, my Lord," said the young captain.
"Fly, john?"
"Yes, my Lord; we should try in vain!
He still looked, and for a moment his glass was pointed toward the horizon to windward.
"We must not look out for troubles.
There was every reason to fear such an engagement in these narrow seas, in which pirates could ply their trade without risk.
"Your Lordship forgets our position.
"Why, john?" replied Glenarvan.
And if your Lordship is bent on looking out for her, let it be in order to give her a wide berth."
The wind was fair, nevertheless, and blew steadily from the southwest; but the currents were against the ship's course, and she scarcely made any way.
"Not for myself, john, but for those I love-whom you love, also."
The heavy, lumpy sea strained her cordage, her timbers creaked, and she labored painfully in the trough of the sea.
"What is it, Coralie?" she asked the woman.
If I lived as luxuriously as my people do, and had servants and costly gowns, the good Pinkies would say that their Queen had more than they themselves-and it would be true.
We do not hate you, as you say the Blueskins do, nor are we savage or cruel; but we do not want you here and I am really puzzled what to do with you."
Meantime you will go home with Coralie, who will feed you and give you entertainment.
TOURMALINE THE POVERTY QUEEN
Did you suppose a palace would be like one of our handsome residences?" asked the woman, evidently surprised.
"Come!" commanded the woman who led the party; "you three must follow me to the presence of Tourmaline.
"Why?" asked Tourmaline, curiously.
The Queen gazed upon our friends with evident interest.
"Pretty wet!
"Majesty!" she exclaimed, flushing a deeper pink.
She says it makes her head ache to perform witchcraft and so she seldom indulges in it.
They tell a queer story of an escape from the Blueskins, so I decided to bring them to you, that you may determine their fate."
No banners floated from it; no flowers grew near it.
"How about witches?" asked Button Bright.
I even decree death, when such a punishment is merited.
"I did not choose to be the Queen," answered Tourmaline, simply.
"In that case," said Button Bright, "you're entitled to the best there is, to pay for your trouble.
In that case my subjects would justly grow envious of my superior station.
It is much more desirable to be a private citizen, happy and care free.
But, if there is no other way, I may be obliged to call upon Rosalie for help.
Pretty wet Was the journey, you can bet!"
"Just Tourmaline.
declared the parrot, in conclusion.
"A splendid palace!" exclaimed one of the Pinkies, and then they looked at one another in amazement and seemed to doubt that their ears had heard aright.
"I know of one witch," said Tourmaline, thoughtfully, "but she is not very obliging.
That is my reward."
"Here," said one of their guides, as the procession halted before the little stone building, "is the palace of Tourmaline, who is our Queen."
"Oh, there are fairies, of course, as there are everywhere," answered Tourmaline; "but none that we can call to our assistance, or command to do our bidding."
As they entered, the girl sighed and laid down her work.
"What pays you, then, for all your bother?" asked Trot.
The people must wait outside, for there is no room for them in the palace."
Your Sky Island ain't very big, so when we couldn't stay in the Blue Country, where ever'body hated us, or in the Fog Bank, which ain't healthy an' is too wet for humans to live in for long, we nat'rally were forced to enter the Pink Country, where we expected to find nice people."
"Thank you," said Trot.
"Oh, no," responded Tourmaline quickly; "that would indeed be very wrong.
So they followed her through the low archway, and in a room beyond, very simply furnished, sat a young girl engaged in darning a pair of pink stockings.
Button Bright told this, and then Trot related their adventures among the Blueskins and how the Boolooroo had stolen the umbrella and prevented them from going home again.
The open space which they entered was paved with pink marble and around it were two rows of large pink statues, at least life-size and beautifully sculptured.
"There is nothing majestic about me, as you know very well.
Her expression was patient and resigned as she faced her audience.
I'll look in the Great Book first.
"We wish so, too.
"No, your Majesty," he replied; "I'm only ----"
The Ruler, be it king or queen, has absolute power to rule, but no riches-no high station-no false adulation.
"Isn't there a law to cover this case?" asked Coralie.
"I know," answered Tourmaline; "but I hope such a responsibility will not fall upon my shoulders.
"But what can you do here?" asked Tourmaline.
"By no means," was the prompt reply.
Cap'n Bill finished the story by telling of their escape through the Fog Bank.
"The Ruler of a country ought to be treated with great respec'," declared Trot, a little indignantly, for she thought the pretty little queen was not being properly deferred to.
Your folks ought to treat you with great respect, as Trot says."
"If not," said the woman, "you must make a law.
It was her badge of office, and seemed very incongruous when compared with her poor raiment and simple surroundings.
If, with my great power, conferred upon me by the people, I also possessed great wealth, I might be tempted to be cruel and overbearing.
She was a beautiful girl of about seventeen years of age, not fat like all the rest of the Pinkies, but slender and well formed according to our own ideas of beauty.
"What shall I call her, then?" inquired Cap'n Bill.
Between them they told the story of how the Magic Umbrella had taken them to Sky Island, which they did not know, when they started, was anywhere in existence.
"I thought it would be better," said the girl.
"What! that little cabin?" exclaimed Trot.
To morrow morning come to me again and then I will decree your fate."
It had no ornamentation, being exceedingly plain in appearance.
"All the palaces I've seen were splendid."
That is her name, and it is sufficient," said the woman.
It is your duty."
In all our history you are the first people from outside our borders who have ever stepped a foot in our land.
A powerful ruler ought to be rich and to live in a splendid palace.
"Perhaps you are trying to ridicule me," she continued, regarding the sailor's face closely.
"They seem very ignorant, poor things!" said another, in reply.
"Of course.
"I have one great privilege.
"A misfortune of birth placed me here and I cannot escape my fate.
Coralie, do you consider 'majesty' a proper word to use when addressing a Queen?" she added, appealing to the Pinky woman.
She smiled-a little sadly-at Trot, seemed to approve Button Bright's open, frank face and was quite surprised because Cap'n Bill was so much bigger than her own people.
"These intruders are very peculiar people," remarked a man in the crowd.
No; our way is best.
"You are not like my people, the Pinkies, and there is no place for you in our country."
The whole scene was depressing; for it argued, at the first glance, at least a stagnation of industry, and perhaps of intellect.
It was one of those effects which a painter loves to represent, and mingled well with the struggling light which found its way between the boughs of the shady arch that vaulted the broad green alley.
The evil and remedy (such as it is) still exist.--But this is remote from our present purpose, and is only thrown out for consideration of the collectors under mr Dent's Dog Bill.
[Footnote: See Note seven.]
The windows were numberless, but very small; the roof had some nondescript kind of projections, called bartizans, and displayed at each frequent angle a small turret, rather resembling a pepper box than a Gothic watchtower.
In a few favoured instances, there appeared behind the cottages a miserable wigwam, compiled of earth, loose stones, and turf, where the wealthy might perhaps shelter a starved cow or sorely galled horse.
Stables and other offices occupied another side of the square.
They stood, without any respect for regularity, on each side of a straggling kind of unpaved street, where children, almost in a primitive state of nakedness, lay sprawling, as if to be crushed by the hoofs of the first passing horse.
Three or four village girls, returning from the well or brook with pitchers and pails upon their heads, formed more pleasing objects, and, with their thin short gowns and single petticoats, bare arms, legs, and feet, uncovered heads and braided hair, somewhat resembled Italian forms of landscape.
The children also, whose skins were burnt black, and whose hair was bleached white, by the influence of the sun, had a look and manner of life and interest. It seemed, upon the whole, as if poverty, and indolence, its too frequent companion, were combining to depress the natural genius and acquired information of a hardy, intelligent, and reflecting peasantry.
It had been built at a period when castles were no longer necessary, and when the Scottish architects had not yet acquired the art of designing a domestic residence.
The house, which seemed to consist of two or three high, narrow, and steep roofed buildings, projecting from each other at right angles, formed one side of the inclosure.
This dove cot, or columbarium, as the owner called it, was no small resource to a Scottish laird of that period, whose scanty rents were eked out by the contributions levied upon the farms by these light foragers, and the conscriptions exacted from the latter for the benefit of the table.
This work of art was the wonder of the country ten miles round.
In the centre of the exterior barrier was the upper gate of the avenue, opening under an archway, battlemented on the top, and adorned with two large weather beaten mutilated masses of upright stone, which, if the tradition of the hamlet could be trusted, had once represented, at least had been once designed to represent, two rampant Bears, the supporters of the family of Bradwardine.
Nor was the court without its ornaments.
Everything around appeared solitary, and would have been silent, but for the continued plashing of the fountain; and the whole scene still maintained the monastic illusion which the fancy of Waverley had conjured up.
Neither did the front indicate absolute security from danger.
The court was spacious, well paved, and perfectly clean, there being probably another entrance behind the stables for removing the litter.
This nether portal, like the former, opened in front of a wall ornamented with some rude sculpture, with battlements on the top, over which were seen, half hidden by the trees of the avenue, the high steep roofs and narrow gables of the mansion, with lines indented into steps, and corners decorated with small turrets.
The opening into the paved court yard corresponded with the rest of the scene.
But almost every hut was fenced in front by a huge black stack of turf on one side of the door, while on the other the family dunghill ascended in noble emulation.
Two battlemented walls, one of which faced the avenue, and the other divided the court from the garden, completed the inclosure.
This person, whom they call Gifted Gilfillan, has been long a leader among them, and now heads a small party, which will pass here to day or to morrow on their march towards Stirling, under whose escort Major Melville proposes you shall travel.
They take their name from their leader, Richard Cameron.'
The habit of inattention must be considered as the greatest bane of the democratic character.
But it must not be supposed that, in the midst of all their toils, the people who live in democracies think themselves to be pitied; the contrary is remarked to be the case.
When an aristocracy carries on the public affairs, its national pride naturally assumes this reserved, indifferent, and haughty form, which is imitated by all the other classes of the nation.
As at any instant these same advantages may be lost, their possessors are constantly on the alert, and make a point of showing that they still retain them.
As these privileges came to them by inheritance, they regard them in some sort as a portion of themselves, or at least as a natural right inherent in their own persons.
Life would have no relish for them if they were delivered from the anxieties which harass them, and they show more attachment to their cares than aristocratic nations to their pleasures.
There is one sort of ignorance which originates in extreme publicity.
It is remarkable that two nations, so recently sprung from the same stock, should be so opposite to one another in their manner of feeling and conversing.
An American, instead of going in a leisure hour to dance merrily at some place of public resort, as the fellows of his calling continue to do throughout the greater part of Europe, shuts himself up at home to drink.
Men living in democracies love their country just as they love themselves, and they transfer the habits of their private vanity to their vanity as a nation.
These persons then displayed towards each other precisely the same puerile jealousies which animate the men of democracies, the same eagerness to snatch the smallest advantages which their equals contested, and the same desire to parade ostentatiously those of which they were in possession.
All free nations are vainglorious, but national pride is not displayed by all in the same manner.
This is more especially the case amongst those free nations which form democratic communities.
When, on the contrary, social conditions differ but little, the slightest privileges are of some importance; as every man sees around himself a million of people enjoying precisely similar or analogous advantages, his pride becomes craving and jealous, he clings to mere trifles, and doggedly defends them.
They want something productive and substantial in their pleasures; they want to mix actual fruition with their joy.
The most slender eulogium is acceptable to them; the most exalted seldom contents them; they unceasingly harass you to extort praise, and if you resist their entreaties they fall to praising themselves.
It would seem as if, doubting their own merit, they wished to have it constantly exhibited before their eyes.
They stand unmoved in their solitary greatness, well assured that they are seen of all the world without any effort to show themselves off, and that no one will attempt to drive them from that position.
It is astonishing what imprudent language a public man may sometimes use in free countries, and especially in democratic States, without being compromised; whereas in absolute monarchies a few words dropped by accident are enough to unmask him forever, and ruin him without hope of redemption.
An Englishman calmly enjoys the real or imaginary advantages which in his opinion his country possesses. If he grants nothing to other nations, neither does he solicit anything for his own.
In despotic States men know not how to act, because they are told nothing; in democratic nations they often act at random, because nothing is to be left untold.
They prefer to these frivolous delights those more serious and silent amusements which are like business, and which do not drive business wholly from their minds.
In democracies men are never stationary; a thousand chances waft them to and fro, and their life is always the sport of unforeseen or (so to speak) extemporaneous circumstances.
I thought that the English constituted the most serious nation on the face of the earth, but I have since seen the Americans and have changed my opinion.
This is explained by what goes before.
Chapter fifteen: Of The Gravity Of The Americans, And Why It Does Not Prevent Them From Often Committing Inconsiderate Actions
Then there are in all classes a very large number of men constantly occupied with the serious affairs of the government; and those whose thoughts are not engaged in the direction of the commonwealth are wholly engrossed by the acquisition of a private fortune.
The former do not know-the latter forget; and the chief features of each picture are lost to them in a bewilderment of details.
Amongst such a people a serious demeanor ceases to be peculiar to certain men, and becomes a habit of the nation.
I believe the seriousness of the Americans arises partly from their pride.
Men who live in democratic countries do not value the simple, turbulent, or coarse diversions in which the people indulge in aristocratic communities: such diversions are thought by them to be puerile or insipid.
In democratic countries even poor men entertain a lofty notion of their personal importance: they look upon themselves with complacency, and are apt to suppose that others are looking at them, too.
An aristocratic class always differs greatly from the other classes of the nation, by the extent and perpetuity of its privileges; but it often happens that the only differences between the members who belong to it consist in small transient advantages, which may any day be lost or acquired.
Such is not the case with the English.
No men are fonder of their own condition.
Nor have they a greater inclination for the intellectual and refined amusements of the aristocratic classes.
She pointed into the gold cottonwood tree behind whose top we stood and said again, "What name?"
"It's no better than a badger hole; no proper dugout at all.
At that moment the father came out of the hole in the bank.
It would take me a long while to explain."
"If they're nice people, I hate to think of them spending the winter in that cave of Krajiek's," said grandmother.
We raced off toward Squaw Creek and did not stop until the ground itself stopped-fell away before us so abruptly that the next step would have been out into the tree tops.
In a moment we were running up the steep drawside together, Yulka trotting after us.
"Well, ma'm, it's politics.
Yulka curled up like a baby rabbit and played with a grasshopper.
Their agreement with him was made before they left the old country, through a cousin of his, who was also a relative of mrs Shimerda.
The road ran about like a wild thing, avoiding the deep draws, crossing them where they were wide and shallow.
"Very glad, very glad!" she ejaculated.
When she coaxed and insisted, I repulsed her quite sternly.
As he approached us, he began to make uncouth noises, and held up his hands to show us his fingers, which were webbed to the first knuckle, like a duck's foot.
Occasionally one of the horses would tear off with his teeth a plant full of blossoms, and walk along munching it, the flowers nodding in time to his bites as he ate down toward them.
Ambrosch, he make good farmer." He struck Ambrosch on the back, and the boy smiled knowingly.
She looked at me, her eyes fairly blazing with things she could not say.
My grandmother always spoke in a very loud tone to foreigners, as if they were deaf.
He wore no hat, and his thick, iron gray hair was brushed straight back from his forehead.
He was nineteen years old, short and broad backed, with a close cropped, flat head, and a wide, flat face.
They looked calm, somehow, and skilled. His eyes were melancholy, and were set back deep under his brow.
We were taking them some provisions, as they had come to live on a wild place where there was no garden or chicken house, and very little broken land.
Immediately she pointed to the bank out of which she had emerged and said, "House no good, house no good!"
The oldest son, Ambroz,--they called it Ambrosch,--came out of the cave and stood beside his mother.
Grandmother nodded consolingly.
He was born like that.
I did n't want her ring, and I felt there was something reckless and extravagant about her wishing to give it away to a boy she had never seen before.
Antonia reached him first, took his hand and kissed it.
The others are smart.
She made mrs Shimerda understand the friendly intention of our visit, and the Bohemian woman handled the loaves of bread and even smelled them, and examined the pies with lively curiosity, exclaiming, "Much good, much thank!"--and again she wrung grandmother's hand.
His face was ruggedly formed, but it looked like ashes-like something from which all the warmth and light had died out.
She shook grandmother's hand energetically.
Presently, against one of those banks, I saw a sort of shed, thatched with the same wine colored grass that grew everywhere.
His hazel eyes were little and shrewd, like his mother's, but more sly and suspicious; they fairly snapped at the food.
The land was growing rougher; I was told that we were approaching Squaw Creek, which cut up the west half of the Shimerdas' place and made the land of little value for farming.
Even from a distance one could see that there was something strange about this boy.
ON Sunday morning Otto Fuchs was to drive us over to make the acquaintance of our new Bohemian neighbors.
I'd have interfered about the horses-the old man can understand some German-if I'd 'a' thought it would do any good.
They could not speak enough English to ask for advice, or even to make their most pressing wants known.
We drove up to this skeleton to tie our horses, and then I saw a door and window sunk deep in the draw bank.
I told her, and she repeated the word, making it sound like "ice." She pointed up to the sky, then to my eyes, then back to the sky, with movements so quick and impulsive that she distracted me, and I had no idea what she wanted.
"Tatinek, Tatinek!" she shouted, and we ran to meet the old man who was coming toward us.
One son, Fuchs said, was well grown, and strong enough to work the land; but the father was old and frail and knew nothing about farming.
We clambered up to the front seat and jolted off past the little pond and along the road that climbed to the big cornfield.
Her face was alert and lively, with a sharp chin and shrewd little eyes.
We sat down and made a nest in the long red grass.
They made a gold ribbon across the prairie.
Antonia pointed up to the sky and questioned me with her glance.
I could hardly wait to see what lay beyond that cornfield; but there was only red grass like ours, and nothing else, though from the high wagon seat one could look off a long way.
"Name?
He was neatly dressed.
The door stood open, and a woman and a girl of fourteen ran out and looked up at us hopefully.
"Now, why is that, Otto?"
She was quick, and very eager.
She was not old, but she was certainly not young.
Grandmother looked interested.
Do it on your own time!"
"Hilda came to the beach with us," I say.
He looks at her, puts his head back and goes on sleeping.
When are you getting rid of these cats?
That's for three years.
The two stray kittens gradually make themselves at home.
Sorry I got sore."
Pop brings out the champagne, and the cork blows and hits the ceiling.
In that I can also choose what metropolitan area I want to be stationed in.
For one thing, Mom really likes them.
"I'll have to check some more," says Tom.
Hilda sits on the sofa, where Cat is curled up.
He says, "Hereafter I will only turn off your t v programs before they start, not in the middle."
"Doesn't pay enough?" Pop asks.
So that's what we've been talking about all evening.
I get the pillows comfortably arranged on the floor, with a big bottle of soda and a bag of popcorn within easy reach.
"I told Tom we shouldn't come so late," says Hilda.
"You're getting altogether too upset about these programs.
"Well, it's not just the pay.
So o k, go ahead, you can finish it."
It's not a western."
"Congratulations!" he says.
"Here's to Cat!
Pop fills little glasses for them and raises his to Tom and Hilda.
"HERE'S TO CAT!"
"Well, shove back the coffee cups, and I'll break out that bottle of champagne that's been sitting in the icebox since Christmas."
I say, "Well, o k
I jump up, tipping over the bottle of soda on the way.
"Pop, that's not fair!
That's the last straw.
"That's recreation, not a course.
He's taking the kid for a walk when a thunderstorm blows up.
Pop moves out of the doorway.
I hardly know what starts it, but a fight boils up, and we're both breathing fire like dragons on the loose.
There's still enough left for one big glass.
Stop it and behave yourself.
The program goes on till eleven o'clock, and Mom won't let me watch it on school nights.
I turn off the television set-I've lost track of what's happening, and it doesn't seem to be the grandfather who's the spook after all.
"So-he cares."
Tom stirs his coffee vigorously and takes one sip and puts the cup down.
There'll be another western on tomorrow night."
It's Tom, and Hilda is with him.
I go and retrieve my spilled bottle of soda.
"Goodness, who could that be so late?" says Mom.
"But anyway, you shouldn't get so sore about an old television program that you shout 'Mop it up yourself' at me."
"Huh.
Really.
She sneaks the kittens saucers of cream and bits of real hamburger when no one's looking, and she likes talking to them in the kitchen.
"Sure.
Pop says, "You sound like the recruiting officer himself.
"Do you good to listen to a real program for a change.
It's a real lemon-just a lot of preaching about government and citizenship.
Come in and sit down."
It's the first time Hilda has been to our house, and Tom introduces her around.
"Here, Davey old boy, we can do better than that tonight.
"Music!" he snorts.
"Yeah, it's about over by now." I'm still sore, and besides Pop's still standing in my door, so I figure there's a hitch in this somewhere.
"They might," he grunts.
I'll be lucky if I have time to breathe.
So we both try to do a little better, and a lot of things we used to argue and fight about, like my jazz records, we just kid each other about now.
I'm not fixing to start an annex to Kate's cat home!"
mr Palumbo comes back to the shop then, and Tom gets busy with the plants.
"Me?
Tom says, "Thanks" and looks at Hilda, and she blushes.
This is o k with the school-but not with pop
Pop doesn't look as surprised as I do.
Pop says "Hmm" this time, and we both stand and simmer down.
As long as there's a bone on the floor, the two of you worry it."
We want to get married."
"Hmm."
He switches the channel.
He scales his hat at the lot of them and roars down the hall to me, "Hey, Davey!
I've decided to enlist in the Army."
Pop looks at me prissily.
"Pop, it's a course.
I go home, wondering if I really am at all like pop
It's a quarter to eleven.
"It's your fault!
The job isn't getting me anywhere I want to go.
"Here's to you-a long, happy life!"
I go down to the flower shop to grouse to Tom.
She doesn't pick them up, but just having them in the room sure doesn't give her asthma.
I shout, "See?
You think the school signs me up for an hour of home record playing?"
It makes me think.
Then there's one of those moments of complete silence, with everyone looking embarrassed, before we all start to speak at once.
You're both impatient and curious, got to poke into everything.
Tom wouldn't even be standing here if it wasn't for Cat."
"The recruiting officer, as a matter of fact, tried to persuade me to shoot for officers' training and go into the Army as a career.
He just likes to boss everything I do."
The story starts off with some nature shots of a farm and mountains in the background and this little kid playing with his grandfather.
"Besides," says Tom, "half the reason you and your father are always bickering is that you're so much alike."
I hear the t v going for a few minutes, then Pop turns it off and goes in the kitchen to talk to Mom.
The second semester I switch to a music course.
Sometimes schools do let kids take a lot of soft courses, and then they're out on a limb later."
Tom drinks a little more coffee and then he goes on: "The trouble is, I can't get married on this flower shop job."
Just as I get the t v on and settle down, the doorbell rings.
Pop and I can go along real smooth and easy for a while, and I think: Well, he really isn't a bad guy, and I'm growing up, we can see eye to eye-all that stuff.
You know, I'd get drafted in a year or two, anyway.
As for keeping cats in my room, that's pretty well forgotten.
"Why does Pop have to come butting into my business at school?
"No, not if I enlist in the Army.
Right away when I bring home my new program, he says, "How come you're taking one less course this half?"
Knocks-that's something.
He does, and for once I win a round-I keep music for this semester.
Somehow or other Cat has taught them that he's in charge here, and he just chases them for fun now and again, when he's not busy sleeping.
Pop goes to the door.
Go get a sponge to mop up the soda."
It's funny about fights.
The only time we have any trouble from the cats is one evening when Pop comes home and the two kittens skid down the hall between his legs, with Cat after them.
Usually he just barges in.
"You're not going to loaf your way through school if I have anything to say about it."
"Well, I don't think you should turn a guy's t v program off in the middle without even finding out about it."
"Loaf!" I yelp.
It's after Valentine's Day, and business is slack and the boss is out.
We get a holiday Washington's Birthday, which is good because there's a t v program on Tuesday, the night before the holiday, that I hardly ever get to watch.
The Governor and the Mayor are on a t v debate about New York City school reorganization."
In fact, one thing this cat business seems to have established is that me and Pop fighting is the main cause of Mom's asthma.
Mop it up yourself!" I'm too mad now to care what I say. I charge down the hall to my room and slam the door.
And there is an old story about this, which I shall tell you.
But some of the birds were not like him, nor like the patient little Wren.
Of course, of course!
I don't know anything about housekeeping." And the poor silly things ruffled up their feathers and looked miserable as only a little bird can look when it is unhappy.
"O wise Mother Magpie, dear Mother Magpie," they cried, "teach us how to build our nests like yours, for it is growing night, and we are tired and sleepy."
"Ha, ha!
Did you ever notice how different are the nests which the birds build in springtime, in tree or bush or sandy bank or hidden in the grass?
And they all promised that they would.
"What silly birds they are!" she croaked.
You have seen what wonderful swinging baskets the Oriole makes for his baby cradle?
"Criss cross, criss cross, so," interrupted the Wood Pigeon.
Mother Magpie snapped her eyes at him and went on, "Next you must lay a feather on a bit of moss, to start the walls."
"Oh yes, oh yes!" croaked old Daddy Crow, interrupting her rudely.
Some do better than others, but none build like Mother Magpie.
Then all the other birds chirped eagerly, "Yes, yes!
She gathered turf and sticks, and with clay bound them firmly together in a stout elm tree.
Look there!" he cried.
About her house she built a fence of thorns to keep away the burglar birds who had already begun mischief among their peaceful neighbors.
But oh!
MOTHER MAGPIE'S KINDERGARTEN
Let us ask her to teach us!"
In that lovely garden where they lived the birds went fluttering about trying their new wings, so interested in this wonderful game of flying that they forgot all about preparing a home for the baby birds who were to come.
She turned toward the Wood Pigeon, who was a rattle pated young thing, and who was not having any success with the sticks which she was trying to place.
What a pickle the other birds were in!
Already she had found out a way, and was busily building a famous nest for herself.
And some of the birds, who were attentive and careful, soon saw how it was done, and started nice homes for themselves.
You are spoiling your nest.
"We all know that-anything more?" chirped the chorus of birds, trying to conceal how anxious they were to know what came next, for the nests were only half finished.
The lesson was but half finished, and most of them had not the slightest idea what to do next. That is why to this day many of the birds have never learned to build a perfect nest.
"Certainly, of course," screamed the Jackdaw.
Mother Magpie took two sticks in her beak and began like this: "First of all, my friends, you must lay two sticks crosswise for a foundation, thus," and she placed them carefully on the branch before her.
So, in a great company, they came fluttering, hopping, twittering up to the elm tree where Mother Magpie nestled comfortably in her new house.
But presently a sharp eyed Sparrow spied Mother Magpie sitting in her nest.
But Mother Magpie was thoroughly disgusted, and refused to go on with the lesson which had been so rudely interrupted by her pupils.
Now such sad things as this happen because in their youth the lazy father and mother birds did not learn their lesson when Mother Magpie had her class in nest making.
Tell us something new."
So, as she went on bit by bit, the silly things pretended that they had known all about it from the first-which was very unpleasant for their teacher.
Let us ask her to teach us."
When these things were all piled up before her she told every bird to do just as she did.
"I thought that was the way to begin."
Sometimes after a heavy wind you find on the ground under the nest poor little broken eggs which rolled out and lost their chance of turning into birds with safe, safe wings of their own.
It was like a great big kindergarten of birds playing at a new building game, with Mother Magpie for the teacher.
"I knew that came next. That is what I told the Parrot but a moment since."
You say you know all about it,--then go on and finish your nests by yourselves.
She popped into her new house and sat there comfortably, peering out through the window slits with her sharp little eyes.
What would they not give for a nest like mine!"
She was indeed a clever bird!
Some are wonderfully wrought, pretty little homes for birdikins.
Much luck may you have!" And away she flew to her own cosy nest in the elm tree, where she was soon fast asleep, forgetting all about the matter.
She began to show them how to weave the bits of things together into nests, as they should be made.
Indeed, it is not a nest at all, only the beginning of one.
And the queerest part of all is that the birds blamed the Magpie for the whole matter, and have never liked her since.
She was not the best-oh, no!--but she was the cleverest and wisest of all the birds; it seemed as if she knew everything that a bird could know.
But others are clumsy, and carelessly fastened to the bough, most unsafe cradles for the feathered baby on the treetop.
Mother Magpie hopped up and down on one leg, so angry she could hardly croak.
The Magpie said she would teach them if they would be a patient, diligent, obedient class of little birds.
The clumsiest nest of all is that which the Wood Pigeon tries to build.
"Oho!
All except Mother Magpie!
"Mother Magpie has found a way.
When the time came to lay their eggs the parents knew not what to do.
She made them perch about her in a great circle, some on the lower branches of the trees, some on the bushes, and some on the ground among the grass and flowers.
In the early springtime of the world, when birds were first made, none of them-except Mother Magpie-knew how to build a nest.
But the Wood Pigeon was in the worst case of them all.
Some of them were lazy and stupid and envious of Mother Magpie's cosy nest, which was already finished, while theirs was yet to do.
Well, it was the Magpie who taught him how, and he was the prize pupil, to be sure.
Kensington Gardens is almost the only place that has realised his idea of the forests of Spenser and Ariosto.
He was resolved to avoid any explanations until he heard from Lord Montfort.
IN MOMENTS of deep feeling, alike sudden bursts of prosperity as in darker hours, man must be alone.
And now all had ended so happily!
Ferdinand Armine had great tenderness of disposition, and somewhat of a meditative mind; schooled by adversity, there was little doubt that his coming career would justify his favourable destiny.
That was a mad life.
Was it not all a dream of his own creation, while his eye had been fixed in abstraction on that bright and flowing river?
What a pity, that instead of a princess in distress we meet only a nurserymaid!
As for Henrietta, it seemed to him that he never could have heart to meet her again, unless they were alone.
A beautiful bride awaited him, whom he had loved with intense passion, and who he had thought but an hour ago was another's.
About the time that Ferdinand directed his steps from these green retreats towards Berkeley Square, a servant summoned Miss Temple to her father.
'Only my lord with him,' was the reply.
It was barely a year since he had returned from Malta, but what an eventful twelvemonth!
Oh! could it indeed be true?
How many incidents, how many characters, how many feelings flitted over his memory!
Restless with impending joy, he sauntered to the bridge, and leant over the balustrade, gazing on the waters in charmed and charming vacancy.
Ferdinand Armine, who, two days back, deemed himself alone in the world!
With the exception of Constantinople, there is no city in the world that can for a moment enter into competition with it.
He could not flatter himself that he indeed merited such singular blessings; and yet with all his faults, which with him were but the consequences of his fiery youth, Ferdinand had been faithful, to Henrietta.
Everything that had occurred previously seemed of another life; all his experience was concentrated in that wonderful drama that had commenced at Bath, the last scene of which was now approaching; the characters, his parents, Glastonbury, Katherine, Henrietta, Lord Montfort, Count Mirabel, himself, and mr Temple!
In exactly ten minutes it is in the power of every man to free himself from all the tumult of the world; the pangs of love, the throbs of ambition, the wear and tear of play, the recriminating boudoir, the conspiring club, the rattling hell; and find himself in a sublime sylvan solitude superior to the cedars of Lebanon, and inferior only in extent to the chestnut forests of Anatolia.
But then there was Henrietta's letter.
'Is papa alone?' enquired Miss Temple.
Count Mirabel was the only person to whom he could abandon his soul, and Count Mirabel was still in his first sleep.
On every side the most charming retreats open to them, nor is there a metropolis in the world surrounded by so many rural villages, picturesque parks, and elegant casinos.
He might be enchanted, but that was the talisman.
So Ferdinand entered Kensington Gardens, and walked in those rich glades and stately avenues.
It seems to the writer of this history that the inhabitants of London are scarcely sufficiently sensible of the beauty of its environs.
It is here that we should get our speeches by heart, invent our impromptus; muse over the caprices of our mistresses, destroy a cabinet, and save a nation.
A noble fortune, which would permit him to redeem his inheritance, and rank him among the richest commoners of the realm, was to be controlled by one a few hours back a prisoner for desperate debts.
What man in the world had friends like Ferdinand Armine?
What a Neapolitan ball was his career then!
But here is the fitting and convenient locality to brood over our thoughts; to project the great and to achieve the happy.
In the present unsettled, though hopeful state of affairs, Ferdinand would not go home.
It requires some self communion to prepare ourselves for good fortune, as well as to encounter difficulty, and danger, and disgrace.
He seated himself on a bench and thought of Henrietta Temple! he took out her note, and read it over and over again.
It was one of those soft summer mornings which are so delightful in a great city.
His constancy to her was now rewarded. As for his friends, the future must prove his gratitude to them.'
Ferdinand felt his freedom as well as his happiness.
Ah! that was a name that a little disturbed him; and yet he felt confidence now in Mirabel's prescience; he could not but believe that with time even mr Temple might be reconciled!
On july twenty third eighteen eighty five, the General surrendered to a loathsome cancer, and the testimonials of devotion shown the honored dead; and the bereaved family throughout the civilized world, indicated the stronghold upon the hearts of the people held by the dead General.
Personally, at this early age, he detested war and was opposed to accepting the opportunity, but his father persuaded him to go, and his name was blunderingly registered as u s, instead of h u, hence he was ever after known as u s Grant.
They visited nearly all the countries of Europe, and part of those of Africa and Asia.
On july twenty fifth eighteen sixty six, he was made general of the United States army; the rank having been created for him, he was the first to hold it.
After various flanking movements and costly assaults, the problem of taking Lee narrowed itself down to a siege of Petersburg.
ULYSSES SIMPSON GRANT.
I propose to move upon your works at once." The fall of Fort Donelson and the capture of its garrison being the first substantial victory that had crowned the Union cause, together with the above described answer to General Buckner, brought the name of General Grant prominently before the country.
"Considering the strength of the rebel position, and the difficulty of storming his intrenchments, the battle of Chattanooga must be considered the most remarkable in history.
Time wore away, and on the ninth of April, eighteen sixty five, Grant captured the Confederate army under Lee, thus virtually ending the war.
On this trip the Grant party were the guests of nearly all the crowned heads of those foreign countries, everywhere receiving the most exalted honors it has ever been the pleasure of an American to enjoy, and on his return to the United States they were the recipients of an ovation in many of the principal cities of this country.
Having married a Miss Dent, of saint Louis, he accordingly moved onto a farm near that city.
When a man is energetic and determines to be somebody in the world-which is praiseworthy so long as that energy is guided by propriety and a just conception of right-there are always scores, hundreds, perhaps thousands of people who endeavor to depreciate that man's reward.
Indeed, if ever a General deserved honor, Grant had won it; he had opened the Mississippi to navigation, and had captured nearly one hundred thousand prisoners and arms."
When his public services were finished he started in company with his wife, son Jesse, and a few friends.
General Halleck in speaking of this battle said:
The scenes of his later days were clouded with the intrigues of a stock gambler, but the stain that the Grant Ward failure seemed likely to throw on the spotless reputation of General Grant was wiped away when the facts were brought to light, and a new lustre was added to his fame by the self sacrifice shown in the final settlement.
Grant perceived that his only hope lie in literally starving the Confederate army out by cutting off all resources as far as practicable.
He was now commander of all the Federal forces.
He at once inaugurated two campaigns to be carried on at once.
His success seems to have been the outgrowth of hard study and ability to perform the most exhaustive labor without fatigue.
At the next Republican Convention, Grant was nominated for President on the first ballot, and was elected over Seymour, and was re-elected a second term by an increased majority.
The capture of Lee was a far more difficult undertaking.
It will be remembered that Lee and McClellan each ranked second when they graduated.
Thomas l Hamer he was admitted at West Point in eighteen thirty nine.
Pittsburgh Landing followed and then Grant determined to take Vicksburg. All his generals declared the plan he proposed unmilitary and impossible, but after several unsuccessful attempts the Gibraltar of the Mississippi was captured, and this time twenty seven thousand prisoners taken.
Lee attempted to draw off attention toward Washington, but General Sheridan drove Early out of the Shenandoah Valley, devastating the country to such an extent that it was impossible to forage an army there should Lee attempt such a maneuver again.
In eighteen forty three he graduated, ranking twenty first in a class of thirty nine.
Now came the battle of Chattanooga.
After the war he was stationed at Detroit, and Sacketts Harbor, but this kind of inactivity was ill suited to the restless nature of Grant; he therefore resigned.
No other excuse can be assigned for the slander and vituperation which has from time to time been heaped upon the fair reputation of General u s Grant.
His first great victory was the capture of Fort Donelson with fifteen thousand prisoners.
One under Sherman, against Atlanta commanded by the skillful rebel General Johnson; the other under Meade, directed against Lee and the Confederate capitol.
General Grant proved to be a writer of no low order, and his autobiography is a very readable book.
After Grant had turned the Confederate right flank, Sherman was intercepted between Longstreet and Bragg, thus cutting Longstreet entirely out, and preventing another junction being possible.
When the news of the fall of Fort Sumter reached Galena he immediately raised a company and marched to Springfield where they tendered their services to the governor.
The Mexican war came on and Grant here distinguished himself, rising to the rank of captain.
Grant acted as mustering officer until, being commissioned colonel of the Twenty first Illinois Volunteers, he took the field.
Resolutions of thanks were passed in Ohio and New York, and Congress created Grant a Lieutenant General, a commission which had been held by no one since General Scott resigned.
At this time Grant was not taken with war, and probably evinced little interest in army tactics.
A person would think that, after a family had lived so long in a place, all the neighbors would be fond of them, yet it is not so.
You would think that, with six legs apiece and three joints in each leg, they might walk quite fast, yet they never did.
They thought he might be going to take a nap after his dinner. Then they all stood even closer together and stuck out their lower lips at him.
The Dragon Flies may be very good people-and even the Snapping Turtle says that they are-still, they are so peculiar that many of their neighbors do not like them at all.
The Dragon Flies have always lived near the pond.
Not the same ones that are there now, of course, but the great great great grandfathers of these.
She was often impatient, and said she could never go anywhere without one of the larvae tagging along.
"I tell you what let's do," said another Nymph.
The Minnow Mothers did not think it was so much in the way the eggs were laid, "although," said one, "I always lay mine close together, instead of scattering them over the whole pond." They thought the trouble came from bad bringing up or no bringing up at all.
"Horrid old thing!" said one larva.
Indeed, the lower lip of a Dragon Fly child might well frighten people, for it is fastened on a long, jointed, arm like thing, and has pincers on it with which it catches and holds its food.
"Our upper lips are so small they don't matter."
They always ate plain food and plenty of it, and they never ate between meals.
Sure enough, there he came through the shallow water, his wet back shell partly out of it and shining in the sunlight.
When they wanted to hurry, they breathed this water out so suddenly that it sent them quickly ahead.
THE DRAGON FLY CHILDREN AND THE SNAPPING TURTLE
"I wish I could sting him."
When they reached the shallow water, the Dragon Fly children stood close together, with the larvae in the middle and the Nymphs all around them. The Snapping Turtle was nowhere to be seen, so they had to wait.
"What can you expect," exclaimed one of them, "when Dragon Fly eggs are so carelessly laid?
Even when they are only larvae, or babies, they are not good playmates, for they have such a bad habit of putting everything into their mouths.
"Well, our lower lips anyway," answered the Nymph.
"Scared?
Most of the time, the Dragon Fly child keeps the joint bent, and so holds his lip up to his face like a mask.
Indeed, the Stickleback Father once told the little Sticklebacks that they should not stir out of the nest, unless they would promise to keep away from the young Dragon Flies.
I saw a Dragon Fly Mother laying some only yesterday, and how do you suppose she did it?
When they had to, they hurried in another way by taking a long leap through the water.
Who's afraid," answered he.
They had been short and plump, and now they were longer and more slender, and there were little bunches on their shoulders where the wings were growing under their skin.
Now most of the larvae were turning into Nymphs, which are half grown Dragon Flies.
Just flew around in the sunshine and visited with her friends, and once in a while flew low enough to touch the water and drop one in.
It is disgraceful!"
He came straight toward the Dragon Fly children, and they were glad to see that he did not look hungry.
"Well, you can't," said a Nymph, turning towards him so suddenly that he leaped.
"Aren't you scared?" whispered one larva to another.
Dah!
Their stomachs were as long as their bodies, and they were never really happy unless their stomachs were full.
They all put their queer little three cornered heads together, and there was an ugly look in their great staring eyes.
The Giant Water Bug (Belostoma), was the only bug who was not afraid of them when they made faces.
They thought he might run away when they did this.
Of course they breathed water like their neighbors, the fishes and the Tadpoles.
They knew that whenever they stuck out their lower lips at the small fishes and bugs, they swam away as fast as they could.
The Stickleback Mothers said that it was all the fault of the Dragon Fly Mothers.
But sometimes he straightens the joint and holds his lip out before him, and then its pincers catch hold of things.
They had breakfast from the time they awakened in the morning until the sun was high in the sky, then they had dinner until the sun was low in the sky, and supper from that time until it grew dark and they went to sleep: but never a mouthful between meals, no matter how hungry they might be.
"Let's all go together to the shallow water where he suns himself, and let's all stand close to each other, and then, when he comes along, let's stick out our lips at him!"
They thought it would scare the Snapping Turtle dreadfully.
"Oh, look!" cried a Nymph.
They were always slow children.
They had outgrown their old skins a great many times, and had to wriggle out of them to be at all comfortable.
They did not breathe it into their mouths, or through gills, but took it in through some openings in the back part of their bodies.
Like most growing children, the Dragon Fly larvae and Nymphs had to eat a great deal.
"We'll do it," exclaimed all the Dragon Fly children, and they started together to walk on the pond bottom to the shallow water.
Just you wait until I change my skin once more, and then won't I have a good time!
That laugh, now, when she doubles over at the hips-who ever heard it out of Galway?
A little attack of nerves, possibly."
Mainhall laughed.
She doesn't take up with anybody, you know.
If we had one real critic in London-but what can one expect?
He's another who's awfully keen about her.
He hated them when they presumed to be anything else.
Sometimes a little jolt like that does one good.
She hadn't much ambition then, and she was too fond of trifles.
She doubtless hasn't thought of me for years." He felt the enthusiasm of the house at once, and in a few moments he was caught up by the current of MacConnell's irresistible comedy.
It was youth and poverty and proximity, and everything was young and kindly.
When they reached their box the house was darkened and the orchestra was playing "The Cloak of Old Gaul." In a moment Peggy was on the stage again, and Alexander applauded vigorously with the rest.
The fact is, she's feeling rather seedy, poor child.
He had preconceived ideas about everything, and his idea about Americans was that they should be engineers or mechanics.
They met a good many acquaintances; Mainhall, indeed, knew almost every one, and he babbled on incontinently, screwing his small head about over his high collar.
I dare say it's quite true that there's never been any one else." Mainhall vouched for her constancy with a loftiness that made Alexander smile, even while a kind of rapid excitement was tingling through him.
MacConnell grunted.
She's really MacConnell's poetic motif, you see; makes the whole thing a fairy tale."
But I never thought she'd do anything.
"And you'll never bring Hilda out like this again.
"All the same," he lifted his glass, "here's to you, little Hilda.
"Hilda Burgoyne!" Alexander exclaimed mildly.
In the half light he looked about at the stalls and boxes and smiled a little consciously, recalling with amusement Sir Harry's judicial frown.
One of your countrymen, Alexander, by the way; an American student whom she met in Paris, I believe.
The nephew of one of the standard Victorian novelists, Mainhall bobbed about among the various literary cliques of London and its outlying suburbs, careful to lose touch with none of them.
I say!
When she began to dance, by way of showing the gossoons what she had seen in the fairy rings at night, the house broke into a prolonged uproar.
It's going famously to night, Mac.
After all, we were awfully young.
"And have I done anything so fool as that, now?" he asked.
"It's tremendously well put on, too.
She's at her best in the second act.
The ones who have any imagination do."
After he met Winifred Pemberton he seemed to himself like a different man.
Mainhall liked Alexander because he was an engineer.
"That's what I was saying," Mainhall lounged a little nearer and dropped into a tone even more conspicuously confidential.
Hilda had never replied to his letter.
Mainhall cut in impatiently.
As they sat down, a burst of applause drew Alexander's attention to the stage.
He had been in London more or less, but he had never happened to hear of her.
You see, one can't be jealous about things in general; but about particular, definite, personal things,"--here she had thrown her hands up to his shoulders with a quick, impulsive gesture-"oh, about those I should be very jealous.
After her dance she withdrew from the dialogue and retreated to the ditch wall back of Philly's burrow, where she sat singing "The Rising of the Moon" and making a wreath of primroses for her donkey.
There's everything in seeing Hilda while she's fresh in a part.
Sir Harry wrinkled his brows judiciously.
Do you know, Alexander,"--Mainhall looked with perplexity up into the top of the hansom and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved finger,--"do you know, I sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself.
Blinking up at the lights, Mainhall added in his luxurious, worldly way: "She's an elegant little person, and quite capable of an extravagant bit of sentiment like that.
"MacConnell, let me introduce mr Bartley Alexander.
He felt guilty and unhappy about her for a time, but after Winifred promised to marry him he really forgot Hilda altogether.
Myself, I always knew she had it in her.
Sir Harry Towne bowed and said that he had met mr Alexander and his wife in Tokyo.
A man writes to the top of his bent only once."
"Poor old Hugh," Mainhall murmured.
It's only lately, since MacConnell and his set have got hold of her, that she's come up.
For some reason he felt pleased and flattered by the enthusiasm of the audience.
I shouldn't wonder- But they've probably spoiled her, so that she'd be tiresome if one met her again."
I should torture myself-I couldn't help it." After that it was easy to forget, actually to forget.
Here comes Sir Harry Towne.
She's apt to grow a bit stale after a time.
He spoke with an extreme Oxford accent, and when he was talking well, his face sometimes wore the rapt expression of a very emotional man listening to music.
I shouldn't wonder if she could laugh about it with me now.
"I say, Sir Harry, the little girl's going famously to night, isn't she?"
She saves her hand, too.
When they entered the stage box on the left the first act was well under way, the scene being the interior of a cabin in the south of Ireland.
Of course, Hilda is Irish,--the Burgoynes have been stage people for generations,--and she has the Irish voice.
Sir Harry Towne, mr Bartley Alexander, the American engineer."
Miss Burgoyne and her donkey were thrusting their heads in at the half door. "After all," he reflected, "there's small probability of her recognizing me.
He had not thought of Hilda Burgoyne for years; indeed, he had almost forgotten her.
"Why, I haven't heard of her for-years."
And what an audience!
Just then they drove up to the Duke of York's, so Alexander did not commit himself, but followed Mainhall into the theatre.
She must care about the theatre a great deal more than she used to.
The playwright gave Mainhall a curious look out of his deep set faded eyes and made a wry face.
Bartley smiled and yawned and went to bed.
Perhaps she has me to thank for something, after all.
He bowed as the warning bell rang, and Mainhall whispered: "You know Lord Westmere, of course,--the stooped man with the long gray mustache, talking to Lady Dowle.
"Then you can't have heard much at all, my dear Alexander.
"He's hit terribly hard.
Let me introduce you.
He nodded curtly and made for the door, dodging acquaintances as he went.
"You see," he murmured in Alexander's ear, as the curtain fell on the first act, "one almost never sees a part like that done without smartness or mawkishness.
Lady Westmere is very fond of Hilda."
Dear me, Mac, the girl couldn't possibly be better, you know."
You'll never do anything like this again, mark me.
You've made things come your way, and I never thought you'd do it.
Alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze.
I won't promise.
And I've got nobody but you.
"It's the whole thing that troubles me, Hilda.
"I am not a man who can live two lives," he went on feverishly.
"There's something troubling you, Bartley.
"Yes, I know I'm cowardly. I'm afraid of myself.
"Don't cry, don't cry," he whispered.
Then came all those years without you, lonely and hurt and discouraged; those decent young fellows and poor Mac, and me never heeding-hard as a steel spring.
Come over to the fire; you're chilled through."
She looked about desperately from Bartley to the door, then to the windows, and back again to Bartley.
I thought it might be Sister Kate or Cousin Mike would be happening along.
I can't see you at all, anywhere.
"Oh, what a grand thing to happen on a raw day!
"I understand, Bartley.
She bit her lip and looked down at her hands, which were clasped tightly in front of her.
What I mean is that I want you to promise never to see me again, no matter how often I come, no matter how hard I beg."
Something of their troubling sweetness came back to Alexander, too.
At last Alexander brought out one word:--
"Yes, I was happy, wasn't I?" She pressed his hand gently in gratitude. "Weren't you happy then, at all?"
The stop at Queenstown, the tedious passage up the Mersey, were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience.
She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, as if to draw in again the fragrance of those days.
"It's too late to ask that.
I have thought about it until I am worn out."
Hilda held her face back from him and began to cry bitterly.
He put out his hand toward her as he looked away again into the fire.
But it's worse now.
He moved uneasily and his chair creaked.
Hilda took a quick, soft breath.
It's different now.
You ask me to stay away from you because you want me!
"It's got to be a clean break, Hilda.
What is it?"
She stood over him with her hands clenched at her side, her body rigid.
At that word "deception," spoken with such self contempt, the color flashed back into Hilda's face as suddenly as if she had been struck by a whiplash.
She looked at his heavy shoulders and big, determined head, thrust forward like a catapult in leash.
"When did you come, Bartley, and how did it happen?
"Just something Bartley.
But afterward. . ."
Bartley bent over and took her in his arms, kissing her mouth and her wet, tired eyes.
I will ask the least imaginable, but I must have SOMETHING!"
It tortures me every minute."
The sight of you, Bartley, to see you living and happy and successful-can I never make you understand what that means to me?" She pressed his shoulders gently.
Hilda sprang up like a flame.
The first was-sort of in play, wasn't it?"
I felt it in my bones when I woke this morning that something splendid was going to turn up.
If you come to me, I'll do as I see fit.
He pulled up a window as if the air were heavy.
The room was empty when he entered.
I will do anything you say-but that!
"Could you-could you sit down and talk about it quietly, Bartley, as if I were a friend, and not some one who had to be defied?"
If I'd met you later, if I hadn't loved you so well-but that's all over, long ago.
I'm growing older, and you've got my young self here with you.
Hilda's face quivered, but she whispered: "Yes, I think it must have been.
Keep away if you wish; when have I ever followed you?
He dropped back heavily into his chair by the fire.
Bartley bent lower over the fire.
The last two days of the voyage Bartley found almost intolerable.
Bartley gave a bitter little laugh, and Hilda looked up and read in the deepening lines of his face that youth and Bartley would not much longer struggle together.
Do you understand?
"It was myself I was defying, Hilda.
She leaned her head against his arm and spoke softly:--
I can do that."
I must have you to think of through the months and months of loneliness.
The shamefulness of your asking me to do that!
Bartley leaned his head in his hands and spoke through his teeth.
At least, tell me that you believe I thought I was making you happy."
I never dreamed it would be you, Bartley.
It's getting the better of me.
"I can't live with myself any longer," he answered roughly.
"We've tortured each other enough for tonight.
Hilda watched him with perplexity.
He looked at her and his haggard face softened.
"Each life spoils the other.
Do you hear me, Bartley? It's too late.
What must I do that I've not done, or what must I not do?" She listened intently, but she heard nothing but the creaking of his chair.
I was wrong.
"Please tell me one thing, Bartley.
I don't trust myself any more.
"What about us, Bartley?" she asked in a thin voice.
When Marie met him at the door, even her strong sense of the proprieties could not restrain her surprise and delight.
A coal fire was crackling in the grate and the lamps were lit, for it was already beginning to grow dark outside.
Alexander did not sit down.
I get nothing but misery out of either.
"After the very first.
There is this deception between me and everything."
Forget everything except that I am here."
She crept across to him, drawing her stool after her.
But why do you let me chatter on like this?
You've only to tell me now.
He had planned to stop in Liverpool; but, instead, he took the boat train for London.
"I meant to, but somehow I couldn't.
I landed at Liverpool this morning and came down on the boat train."
I wanted you always to be happy and handsome and successful-to have all the things that a great man ought to have, and, once in a way, the careless holidays that great men are not permitted."
It's abominable of you to ask me.
She slid to the floor beside him, as if she were too tired to sit up any longer.
I somehow believed that I could take all the bad consequences for you.
"You see, my mistake was in wanting you to have everything.
I carried it all lightly enough at first, but now I don't dare trifle with it.
You haven't spoken a word."
"When did you first begin to feel like this, Bartley?"
"You want to tell me that you can only see me like this, as old friends do, or out in the world among people?
Hilda watched him from her corner, trembling and scarcely breathing, dark shadows growing about her eyes.
He rose and pushed the chair behind him and began to walk miserably about the room, seeming to find it too small for him.
"Always.
He locked and unlocked his hands over the grate and spread his fingers close to the bluish flame, while the coals crackled and the clock ticked and a street vendor began to call under the window.
"Everything!"
Alexander groaned.
Hilda was pale by this time, and her eyes were wide with fright.
I must know about you.
And then you came back, not caring very much, but it made no difference."
But, if you come to me, I'll do as I see fit.
Emerging at Euston at half past three o'clock in the afternoon, Alexander had his luggage sent to the Savoy and drove at once to Bedford Square.
"I can't," he said heavily.
"Yes, yes," she hurried, pulling her hand gently away from him. Presently it stole back to his coat sleeve.
He ignored her question.
"So it's better to be at the mercy of a man you don't love?"
I saw that interview in the paper yesterday, telling where you were, and I thought I had to see you.
"Here, put your feet on this stool. You don't mean to say you walked down-and without overshoes!"
"Did you think I had forgotten you were in town, Hilda?
"What am I to do, Hilda?"
But when I came, I thought I had been mistaken."
Alexander flushed angrily.
"Won't you sit down?"
Hilda smiled up at him beautifully and put her hand on his sleeve.
Alexander hurried toward her and took her gently by the arm.
There was something about him that made Hilda wish herself at her hotel again, in the street below, anywhere but where she was.
Then, when your manager added two more weeks, I was already committed." He dropped upon the stool in front of her and sat with his hands hanging between his knees.
"I didn't know it before, Hilda, on my honor I didn't, but I believe it was because, deep down in me somewhere, I was hoping I might drive you to do just this.
I suppose I would better do it without telling you.
It was furnished with the cast off possessions of his bachelor days and with odd things which he sheltered for friends of his who followed itinerant and more or less artistic callings.
It was after nine o'clock and he was lighting a second pipe, when he thought he heard a sound at his door. He started and listened, holding the burning match in his hand; again he heard the same sound, like a firm, light tap.
Over the fireplace there was a large old-fashioned gilt mirror.
That's all.
If you'd sent me a note, or telephoned me, or anything!
Don't be any more angry than you can help.
But it's no use talking about that now.
His business often called him to New York, and he had kept an apartment there for years, subletting it when he went abroad for any length of time.
CHAPTER nine
I've been through this a hundred times to day.
But you won't let me write to you, and I had to see you after that letter, that terrible letter you wrote me when you got home."
She felt the strength leap in the arms that held her so lightly.
She looked up into his eyes, and hid her face in her hands.
"Of course I know, Bartley," she said at last, "that after this you won't owe me the least consideration.
"Who?"
And he threw it back at me a second time."
He was standing behind the table, turning over a pile of blueprints nervously.
It was to have reached you on the steamer.
Aren't you trying to frighten me?"
When Alexander came back from dinner he put more wood on his fire, made himself comfortable, and settled down at his desk, where he began checking over estimate sheets.
Only not Mac.
I told myself that if I were really thinking of you, and not of myself, a letter would be better than nothing.
"And I," she whispered,--"I felt that you were feeling that.
Let me take off your coat-and your boots; they're oozing water." He knelt down and began to unlace her shoes, while Hilda shrank into the chair.
Give me my things, please." She put her hand out toward the fender.
"They never did to me."
One of them.
Alexander sat down on the arm of her chair.
I was all right until I knew you were in town.
I think I have felt that you were coming." He bent his face over her hair.
He got up and went over to the window, threw it open, and leaned out.
Only I'll do it more completely.
"Is this the way you mean to answer it, Hilda?" he asked unsteadily.
But afterward I shan't have an opportunity to explain, for I shan't be seeing you again."
Alexander moved restlessly.
I'm going to marry."
Can't you see, Bartley, that I'm terribly frightened?
Marks on paper mean something to you." He paused.
"Are you joking, Hilda?"
She was afraid to look up at him.
On the last Saturday in April, the New York "Times" published an account of the strike complications which were delaying Alexander's New Jersey bridge, and stated that the engineer himself was in town and at his office on West Tenth Street.
"You see, you are different, Hilda.
When he looked over his shoulder she was lacing her boots.
Don't do anything like that rashly." His face grew troubled. "You wouldn't be happy.
I don't know what I ought to say, but I don't believe you'd be happy; truly I don't.
Did you write to me?
I've jumped up if the fire crackled.
Try him once again."
"I came to tell you that I'm willing to do as you asked me.
I've watched that door all day.
She tied the knot of the last lacing and put her boot heel down firmly. "No; I'm telling you what I've made up my mind to do.
Hilda hid her face in her hands.
I've been up in Canada with my bridge, and I arranged not to come to New York until after you had gone.
But we sail on Tuesday.
Then I wouldn't have come."
"Under such circumstances, infinitely!"
It's because they can't be at the mercy of the man they love any longer."
There is a letter for you there, in my desk drawer.
You are not that kind of woman.
The yellow light from the student's lamp fell on his hands and the purple sleeves of his velvet smoking jacket, but his flushed face and big, hard head were in the shadow.
"Sit down, Hilda; you're wet through.
Alexander's big work table stood in front of one of the three windows, and above the couch hung the one picture in the room, a big canvas of charming color and spirit, a study of the Luxembourg Gardens in early spring, painted in his youth by a man who had since become a portrait painter of international renown.
Besides his sleeping room and bath, there was a large room, formerly a painter's studio, which he used as a study and office.
"That's what I wanted to see you about, Bartley.
I'm too fond of him."
"Hilda you'd better think a while longer before you do that.
When Hilda rose he sat down on the arm of her chair and drew her back into it.
She closed her eyes; her lips and eyelids trembled.
"Indeed I'm not."
Only one.
"Try him again, Hilda.
He rose and crossed the room quickly.
Alexander started up and began to walk up and down the room.
He heard Hilda moving about behind him.
Alexander started to speak, but caught himself.
"Oh, it doesn't matter much!
He stood for a moment in awkward constraint, his pipe in his hand.
Good night; I'm going now." She turned and her hand closed on the door knob.
"I was afraid to take a cab.
He pointed to a chair by the fire and went back to his worktable.
"Come in," he said to Hilda at last, and closed the door behind her.
Then place the pan on a strong chair, or dresser, or table, of convenient height; pour into the sponge the remainder of the warm milk and water; stir into it as much of the flour as you can with the spoon; then wipe it out clean with your fingers, and lay it aside.

In three quarters hour look at it, and should it have swollen very much, and begin to crack, it will be light enough to bake.

INGREDIENTS.--To every two pounds. of flour allow one teaspoonful of tartaric acid, one teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of carbonate of soda, two breakfast cupfuls of cold milk.
If baked in tins or pans, rub them with a tiny piece of butter laid on a piece of clean paper, to prevent the dough from sticking to them.
TO MAKE YEAST FOR BREAD.
Look at it from time to time: when it has been laid for nearly an hour, and when the yeast has risen and broken through the flour, so that bubbles appear in it, you will know that it is ready to be made up into dough.

Put the flour into a pan, stir in the above ingredients, and let the dough rise, covered in a warm place. Knead it well, make it into rolls, let them rise again for a few minutes, and bake in a quick oven.

Strew plenty of flour on the top; throw a thick clean cloth over, and set it where the air is warm; but do not place it upon the kitchen fender, for it will become too much heated there.
Mix all these ingredients well together; make a hole in the middle of the flour, and pour in the milk, mixed with the egg, which should be well beaten; mix quickly, and set the dough, with a fork, on baking tins, and bake the buns for about twenty minutes.
The nations who make use of it grind it, in the primitive manner, between two stones, and make it into a diet which, cannot be properly called bread, but rather a kind of soft thin cake half baked.
"Ah, father," said Hansel, "I am looking at my white cat sitting upon the roof of the house, and trying to say good bye."
"Be quiet, Grethel," said he; "do not cry-I will help you." And as soon as their parents had gone to sleep, he got up, put on his coat, and, unbarring the back door, went out.
We are going into the forest to hew wood, and in the evening, when we are ready, we will come and fetch you again."
Oh! how horribly the witch howled; but Grethel ran away, and left her to burn to ashes.
They knocked at the door, and when the wife opened it, and saw Hansel and Grethel, she exclaimed, "You wicked children!
Why did you sleep so long in the wood?
As soon as it was noon they saw a beautiful, snow white bird sitting upon a bough, singing so sweetly that they stood still and listened to it.
Come in and stop with me, and no harm shall come to you;" and so saying she took them both by the hand, and led them into her cottage.
They waited so long, that at last their eyes closed from weariness, and they fell fast asleep.
"Had we only been eaten by the wild beasts in the wood, then we should have died together." But the old witch called out, "Leave off that noise; it will not help you a bit."
The next morning, before the sun arose, the wife went and awoke the two children.
Hansel thought the roof tasted very nice, and so he tore off a great piece; while Grethel broke a large round pane out of the window, and sat down quite contentedly.
"We cannot get over," said Hansel; "I can see no bridge at all." "And there is no boat either," said Grethel, "but there swims a white duck, I will ask her to help us over;" and she sang,
"You simpleton!" said the wife, "that is not a cat; it is only the sun shining on the white chimney." But in reality Hansel was not looking at a cat; but every time he stopped, he dropped a pebble out of his pocket upon the path.
When they had gone a little distance, Hansel stood still, and peeped back at the house; and this he repeated several times, till his father said, "Hansel, what are you looking at, and why do you lag behind?
A good meal of milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples and nuts, was spread on the table, and in the back room were two nice little beds, covered with white, where Hansel and Grethel laid themselves down, and were happy as could be.
"First, we will bake, however," said the old woman; "I have already heated the oven and kneaded the dough;" and so saying, she pushed poor Grethel up to the oven, out of which the flames were burning fiercely.
"Hansel, why do you stop and look about?" said the father, "keep in the path." "I am looking at my little dove," answered Hansel, "nodding a good bye to me." "Simpleton!" said the wife, "that is no dove, but only the sun shining on the chimney." But Hansel kept still dropping crumbs as he went along.
So he sprang out, like a bird from his cage when the door was opened; and they were so glad that they fell upon each other's neck, and kissed each other over and over again.
"We must be off now," said Hansel, "and get out of this enchanted forest;" but when they had walked for two hours they came to a large piece of water.
"Oh, you simpleton!" said she, "then we must all four die of hunger; you had better plane the coffins for us." But she left him no peace till he consented, saying, "Ah, but I shall miss the poor children."
Then Grethel gave her a push, so that she fell right in, and shutting the iron door bolted it.
See, I could even get in myself!" and she got up, and put her head into the oven.
HANSEL AND GRETHEL
Once upon a time there dwelt near a large wood a poor wood cutter, with his wife, and two children by his former marriage, a little boy called Hansel, and a girl named Grethel.
So a nice meal was cooked for Hansel, but Grethel got nothing else but a crab's claw.
Grethel wept bitterly, and said to Hansel, "What will become of us?"
Nevertheless he comforted Grethel, saying, "Do not weep; sleep in quiet; the good God will not forsake us."
He had little enough to break or bite; and once, when there was a great famine in the land, he could hardly procure even his daily bread; and as he lay thinking in his bed one night, he sighed, and said to his wife, "What will become of us? How can we feed our children, when we have no more than we can eat ourselves?"
The children, however, had heard the conversation as they lay awake, and as soon as their parents went to sleep Hansel got up, intending to pick up some pebbles as before; but the wife had locked the door, so that he could not get out.
But her husband felt heavy at heart, and thought, "It were better to share the last crust with the children." His wife, however, would listen to nothing that he said, and scolded and reproached him without end.
Will they not be sweet?" So Hansel reached up and broke a piece off the roof, in order to see how it tasted; while Grethel stepped up to the window and began to bite it.
"Little Duck, good little Duck, Grethel and Hansel, together we stand; There is neither stile nor bridge, Take us on your back to land."
"No, wife," replied he, "that I can never do; how can you bring your heart to leave my children all alone in the wood; for the wild beasts will soon come and tear them to pieces?"
"These are better than pebbles," said Hansel, putting as many into his pocket as it would hold; while Grethel thought, "I will take some home too," and filled her apron full.
We thought you were never coming home again." But their father was extremely glad, for it had grieved his heart to leave them all alone.
Hansel kept saying to Grethel, "We will soon find the way;" but they did not, and they walked the whole night long and the next day, but still they did not come out of the wood; and they got very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but the berries which they found upon the bushes.
"Dear good God, help us now!" she prayed.
Then they set fire to them; and as the flame burnt up high, the wife said, "Now, you children, lie down near the fire, and rest yourselves, whilst we go into the forest and chop more wood; when we are ready we will come and call you."
Take care, and remember your legs."
Soon they were so tired that they could not drag themselves along, then they lay down under a tree and again went to sleep.
It was now the third morning since they had left their father's house, and they still walked on; but they only got deeper, and deeper, and deeper into the wood, and Hansel felt that if help did not come very soon they must die of hunger.
When noon came, Grethel shared her bread with Hansel, who had strewn his on the path.
And now, as there was nothing to fear, they went back to the witch's house, where in every corner were caskets full of pearls and precious stones.
Just then the door opened, and a very old woman, walking upon crutches, came out.
On the way Hansel broke his in his pocket, and stopping every now and then, dropped a crumb upon the path.
"We will go in here," said Hansel, "and have a glorious feast.
"No," replied Grethel, "that will be too much for the Duck, she shall take us over one at a time."
Then they began to run, and rushing into the house, they fell upon their father's neck.
Now she ran to Hansel, and, opening the door, called out, "Hansel we are saved; the old witch is dead?"
Hansel and Grethel sat down by the fire, and when it was noon, each ate the piece of bread; and because they could hear the blows of an axe they thought their father was near; but it was not an axe, but a branch which he had bound to an old tree, so as to be blown to and fro by the wind.
This the good little bird did, and when both were happily arrived on the other side, and had gone a little way, they came to a well-known wood, which they knew the better every step they went, and at last they perceived their father's house.
Every morning the old witch came to the cage and said, "Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel whether you are getting fat." But Hansel used to stretch out a bone, and the old woman, having very bad sight, thought it was his finger, and wondered very much why he did not get fat.
Hansel and Grethel were so much frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands; but the old woman nodding her head, said, "Ah, you dear children, what has brought you here?
He who says A must say B too; and he who consents the first time must also the second.
I will eat a piece of the roof, and you can eat the window.
Witches have red eyes, and cannot see very far; but they have a fine sense of smelling, like wild beasts, so that they know when children approach them.
So the Duck came to them, and Hansel sat himself on, and bade his sister sit beside him.
When they awoke, it was quite dark, and Grethel began to cry.
All night long they walked on, and as day broke they came to their father's house.
Early in the morning the stepmother came and pulled them out of bed, and gave them each a slice of bread, which was still smaller than the former piece.
So early in the morning Grethel was compelled to go out and fill the kettle, and make a fire.
"Go back to the regiment," he said, smiling, "all will be needed."
Yet it looked very bad for us.
Nine o'clock came, and now we knew that the great assault was to be made.
Had He done so, all would have been killed on the morrow.
At last the chance came, and for my regiment it was an awful one-the battle of Iuka.
The moon shone so brightly the men in the lines, tired though they were, could scarcely sleep.
Iuka, the fiercest battle of the war, two hundred seventeen men out of four hundred eighty two of my regiment are shot-The awful Rebel charge at Corinth-Moonlight on the battlefield-Bushels of arms and legs-Tombstones for fireplaces-One of Grant's mistakes.
The cloud of Rebels we had seen divided itself into three columns.
The night before the battle of Corinth the Fifth Iowa Regiment lay across the Purdy road, in the bright moonlight.
My friend, with many others, was being carried out to die elsewhere.
Suddenly we heard something, almost like a distant whirlwind.
It was a strange, horrible sight,--but it was war.
Even a foe could feel pity to see brave men so cruelly slaughtered.
And so it was that within two weeks my regiment was placed outside the breastworks at Corinth, to wait and receive another awful assault.
The enemy had not had time to bury them.
While mothers and sisters at home were praying for the safety of these dear ones at the front, their spirits that night were leaving their torn bodies in the dark and ascending heavenward.
Indeed, we of the rank and file had little confidence in Grant in those days.
That evening an order came for us-Hamilton's Division-to assault the enemy's left flank at midnight.
Never will I forget the horrible scenes of that night.
The enemy lost more than one thousand men in trying to destroy that single brigade and its Ohio battery.
We now camped on the edge of the town and went on building still other and greater forts.
The woods were in their fairest foliage, and it seemed too lovely a day for war and bloodshed.
One morning before daylight while camped in the woods near Jacinto half expecting to be attacked, we heard that Price's army was in Iuka, some eighteen miles away, and that if we would hurry there and attack from one side, General Grant, with Ord's troops, would attack from another side.
Our own division, though fighting some, had lost but few men.
One daring Rebel was shot down and bayoneted clear behind the line of Company B, where he had broken through to seize the flag of my regiment.
These recklessly advanced on the forts, climbing over the fallen trees and bending their heads against the awful storm of grape and canister from all our cannon.
There were simply bushels of them, and the floor was running blood.
It was fought by a handful of the troops of General Rosecrans against half the army of General Price.
The bugles played occasionally as the men hurried along, but not a shot was fired.
There were no breastworks, yet that one little brigade of Hamilton's division stood there in the open and repulsed assault after assault.
That order was one of the mistakes of Grant's earlier days as a commander.
With a few lanterns our men then went about and tried to gather up the wounded; the dead were left till morning.
At another spot one hundred eighty two Rebel corpses lay in a row covered by tarpaulins.
My canteen was full of water and I pressed it to the lips of many a dying enemy-enemy no longer.
Our regiment now pursued the flying Rebels with great vigor.
That night I stood guard under an oak tree on the battlefield among the unburied dead.
My own regiment was in the advance.
Our grape shot had torn whole companies of men to pieces.
It was too late, for he was dying.
We looked for it against our own division, as we lay in the grass waiting.
Once in the night I slipped away from the bivouac and hurried to the old Tishimingo Hotel, to see a lieutenant of my company, who had been shot through the breast.
As I entered the building a cannonball from the enemy crashed through the house and killed four soldiers by the stairway.
Many of the wounded, even, had not yet been gathered up.
Another had taken his fine gold watch.
The Rebels were charging works that they themselves had built when they held the town during Halleck's siege. General Haccelman and many other of our officers had fallen.
There were seven hundred eighty two Union men lying there in their blood that long night, six hundred eight of them out of a single small brigade.
We reflected that at Shiloh he was miles away from the battlefield at the critical moment.
It was Lieutenant William Dodd, a classmate in school.
Rosecrans protested.
All that summer, after taking Corinth, we chased up and down the State of Mississippi, trying to get fair battle with the Rebel army.
At Corinth he was forty miles away, and now, when we had the enemy almost within our grasp, he suddenly called us back.
The burying party the next morning found nineteen dead Rebels lying together at one place.
The pursuit of the enemy was being pushed with vigor when the army was ordered to desist and return to camp.
Charge after charge was made upon our little line, and the Eleventh Ohio Battery, which the regiment was protecting, was taken and retaken three times.
At Iuka, Grant, though commander, did not even know a battle was going on.
Our own loss had been two thousand two hundred dead and wounded.
Not Balaklava, nor the Alma, saw such fighting.
Our brigade was fearfully outnumbered. Rosecrans, had ten thousand soldiers within five miles of the battlefield, yet let three or four small regiments and a battery do all the fighting.
How little anyone dreamed that before the sun set two hundred seventeen of that little command would be stretched dead or dying among the autumn leaves!
It was the storming of Fort Robinett.
It required months, and great events, to make Grant the hero of the army which he afterward became.
General Rogers, who had led a brigade into the hopeless pit, lay on his back, dead, with his flag in his hand.
They lay in heaps of dozens, even close up to the works.
God could not answer the prayers of the men in both armies that night.
Yes, it was "hell." I hastened back to the lines.
It was soon full day.
All the night we lay there under the brightest moonlight I ever saw.
How eagerly the regiment made the forward march on that beautiful autumn day!
Every house in town was full of our wounded and our dead lay everywhere.
Possibly the best friend I had in the world, save my kin, was killed at that bridge.
The town seemed full of the groans of dying men.
The order, more imperative than before, was repeated.
Instantly we changed direction a little and, without further firing, witnessed one of the greatest assaults of any war.
Under the same quiet moonlight, and only six hundred yards away from us, also lay the victorious Rebel army.
Brick was scarce, and in a few instances the men used the stone slabs from a graveyard close at hand.
That night the enemy slipped away, leaving hundreds and hundreds of his dead and wounded on the field.
There were only four hundred eighty two of my little regiment now marching there, hoping, almost praying, the enemy might only wait.
It was the Iowa, the Missouri, and the Ohio boys against the boys of Alabama and Mississippi, and the grass and leaves were covered with the bodies in blue and gray.
Five of my eight messmates of the day before were shot.
Fifteen officers of our little half regiment were dead or wounded.
Antietam, Gettysburg, the Wilderness, could show nothing like it. Only the setting sun put an end to what was part of the time a hand to hand conflict.
When the assault had failed and the noise of battle was stilled, I hurried down in front of Robinett.
They had time for reflection as they marched, and they knew now they were going to battle.
Poor Jimmy King! he survived the war only to be murdered later on a plantation in Mississippi.
Rosecrans is at present the hero of this army, and, with him leading it, the boys would storm Hades."
In one of the rooms I saw the floors, tables, and chairs covered with amputated limbs, some white and some broken and bleeding.
A perfect blaze of close range musketry, too, mowed them down like grass.
It was an astounding order, as it was in our power to destroy the defeated and flying columns.
It was a relief to me to get back into the moonlight and out of the horror, yet out there lay thousands of others in line, only waiting the daylight to be also mangled and torn like these.
For some reason the dead at Hatchie Bridge were not buried.
On inquiry for certain ones I learned that they were dead and lying out in the improvised graveyard near by.
Before the hour came, however, the move was decided to be too dangerous, and we changed our position to one nearer the forts.
When morning came the firing opened, and for all that day the battle raged fiercely at the left and center left, we getting the worst of it, too.
Many of the soldiers made huts for themselves.
His head was shot off by a cannonball just as his regiment was charging at the bridge.
My regiment rose to its feet, fired a few moments at scattering Rebels in our front, and were amazed to see a great black column, ten thousand strong, moving like a mighty storm cloud out of the woods and attacking the forts and troops at our left.
It was getting cooler now, and little fireplaces were built in the huts and tents.
Ten miles away, in another direction, lay General Grant and General Ord, with many other thousands, as silent as if paralyzed. An unlucky wind blew, they said, and the sound of our cannon, that was to have been the signal for them to attack also, was unheard by them.
It was just two o'clock when the regiment ran on to the army of the enemy, lying in line right across the road close to Iuka.
Sherman had saved the Union army from destruction there.
"It is not for the youngest and most childish one of us to make the plans," she said.
She was as completely unconscious as her sister.
"It's surely a terrible storm outside," said the merchant's eldest daughter, as the wind rattled the tiles of the roof and the rain beat in torrents against the doors and windows.
The eldest daughter blushed and hung her head.
The doors were strong and held securely.
"Be sure that you admit no one," commanded the merchant.
When the merchant had heard the whole story, he said: "After this we must all give ear to the wisdom of this little maid.
The little girl flew down the stairs and closed the doors of the store securely.
Now, outside this city there was a band of bold robbers.
Every year at a certain day of a certain month he went away to a distant city to collect money on an account.
"I am thinking that our dear father would be anxious if he knew that we had broken our promise so easily," said the youngest sister.
"I do not trust your promises," replied the little maid.
"We two are older and wiser than you are. It is for us to determine what shall be done.
"Oh, why didn't we keep our promise to our father!" cried the middle one.
His wife and daughters remained at home, and all went well until one sad day the wife died.
"Our father has always taught us to show mercy and kindness to the aged."
"He is old as well as poor," she said.
The youngest sister peeped through her long heavy eyelashes and watched the beggar.
If we decide to show mercy to this poor beggar it is not for you to oppose it."
The captain of the band had watched the merchant's departure, and when he was safely away the thief dressed himself in the disguise of an old beggar. When it was evening he led his band into a nearby street and in his disguise approached the merchant's house.
"Thanks to our youngest sister, we are safe."
"It was the youngest one who deceived me!" cried the robber chieftain. "I knew all the time that she did not want to let me in.
We can give this poor beggar some alms and send him away with a blessing."
"Great danger threatened us while you were away," she said.
"She may not be so wise as she appears.
She did not stir and he knew that the sleeping powder had thoroughly done its work.
"Then you can pull my charm out in safety."
She quickly ran upstairs and got the robber's sword which he had left on a chair in the dining room.
The beggar entered the room.
However, in spite of all she could say, the elder sisters opened the door and admitted the beggar.
The man went to the bed of the eldest sister and stuck a pin into her foot to see if she were completely unconscious.
The second daughter added.
Then she heard him go down the stairway and unbolt the heavy doors which led into the store.
The youngest one was so frightened that she could not sleep a single wink.
"I have left my charm behind!" he cried.
Soon she heard footsteps outside.
They were big and heavy, but her great fear gave her strength.
As soon as they had eaten, the girls went to their room, and the two eldest were overcome with sleep almost before they had time to get into bed.
The merchant's daughter at first did not answer; but, as he kept on calling to her, she finally asked him what it was that he wanted.
"Put your hand through the hole in the door," replied the little maid. "Then I'll give you your charm."
"It's in the fire," replied the girl.
"Our little sister was wiser than we were," said the middle daughter.
It was not until their little sister had shown them the robber's hand and the great sword that they were convinced that she had told them the truth.
"It is a fearful night to send away a beggar," said the eldest sister while they were eating.
"You are making it up."
She knew that the thief had brought back others with him.
"How do you know?" asked their father.
When they heard their sister's story they were filled with amazement.
She struck it with all her might with the great sword and cut it off.
"I cannot bear to go away," he said to them.
"Have pity upon a poor unfortunate one!" he called out.
That year the merchant looked forward to his journey with dread for he would have to leave his daughters alone.
Now it happened that there was a little hole in the door just large enough for a man's hand to enter.
"Do not be afraid to leave us, dear father," said his daughters. "Nothing will harm us while you are away."
"We can lock ourselves securely in the house and not let any one enter," said the three daughters.
I was suspicious of her from the first."
They gave him their promise and he started on his journey. Nevertheless, he went with an anxious heart.
The youngest one pretended that she, too, was asleep.
She was so terribly frightened that it was all she could do to keep her teeth from chattering.
Then he went to the bed of the second sister and did the same.
They led him into the kitchen to dry his clothes.
"You shall not come into my father's house."
She threw the apple away.
Long ago there lived a merchant who had three daughters.
In the morning the effect of the sleeping powder wore off and the two elder sisters awoke.
"I see that no harm befell you in my absence," he said as he embraced them fondly.
They gave him his supper in the kitchen and then they ate their own.
Let me enter, I pray you, to pass the night under your roof."
"Go throw vinegar on the fire and put it out," said the captain of the thieves.
"Pray let me enter to get it. I promise you I will do you no harm."
However, the question of leaving three such pretty girls unprotected was a thing not to be regarded lightly.
"My heart is filled with fear lest some evil may befall you during my absence."
"Pass the charm out to me, then," said the robber.
The eldest daughter frowned.
He knocked at the door.
"Remember our promise to our father!" cried the youngest one.
The robber thought that she was as completely overcome by the sleeping powder as the others.
"For shame!" cried the eldest.
At last it was daylight and the band of thieves had to flee.
It hurt terribly when he stuck the pin into the foot of the youngest, but she did not stir.
The second daughter peeped out of the window at the beggar.
"He'll find it difficult to get into our house again," she said to herself as she waited to see if the robber returned.
"I don't believe a word of it!" cried the oldest.
The cries and curses of the robbers filled the air.
"I am older and wiser than you are and I know that there are many evils which might come upon you. There are many bold thieves in this city, for instance, who would be only too ready to take advantage of my absence and rob my home of all I possess."
They tried in vain to break down the great doors.
"All my worries about you were foolish."
She saw to her surprise that he had laid aside the heavy ragged old coat which he had kept wrapped about him even while he ate. Underneath he was dressed like a robber with a sword, pistols and dagger.
He worried about the matter night and day.
"I had such a nightmare myself that I have a headache this morning."
Soon she heard footsteps.
When at last the merchant returned from the distant city where he had been to collect money he was delighted to find his house and his three daughters safe.
The leader of the band of thieves went up close to the keyhole and whispered: "Kind lady of the house, have pity on me."
The two eldest ate their apples, but the youngest could not eat that night.
While they were talking, the beggar had taken the apples which the girls were to eat for dessert and had sprinkled a sleeping powder over them.
Perhaps you can.
How quickly he disappeared!"
The weapon must still have been there.
"But the blood?
"Yes."
"So they tell me."
What do you make of it, Gryce?"
The task of the translator (and with all humility be it spoken) is one of some self denial.
Then, when I say, "Dear Song, I know," I add a stanza as it were handmaid to the others, wherein I say what I desire from this my poem.
The second begins here, "An Angel;" the third here, "Dear Song, I know." The first part is divided into four.
The poem begins here:--
Whereupon I declare that my tongue spake as though by its own impulse, and said, "Ladies that have intelligence in love." These words I laid up in my mind with great gladness, conceiving to take them as my commencement.
The second begins here, "And I declare;" the third here, "Wherefore I will not speak;" the fourth here, "With you alone." Then, when I say "An Angel," I begin treating of this lady: and this part is divided into two.
The third is, as it were, a handmaid to the preceding words.
In the first, I say to whom I mean to speak of my lady, and wherefore I will so speak.
In the third, I say what it is I purpose to speak so as not to be impeded by faintheartedness.
Thereafter, this sonnet bred in me desire to write down in verse four other things touching my condition, the which things it seemed to me that I had not yet made manifest.
And when I had come close up with them, and perceived that they had not among them mine excellent lady, I was reassured; and saluted them, asking of their pleasure.
And I said these four things in a sonnet, which is this:--
Through the sore change in mine aspect, the secret of my heart was now understood of many.
And as I was going that way by chance, (but I think rather by the will of fortune,) I heard one of them call unto me, and she that called was a lady of very sweet speech.
Then I, being almost put to shame because of her answer, went out from among them; and as I walked, I said within myself: "Seeing that there is so much beatitude in those words which do praise my lady, wherefore hath my speech of her been different?" And then I resolved that thenceforward I would choose for the theme of my writings only the praise of this most gracious being.
The second is the matter treated of.
But when I still spake not, one of them, who before had been talking with another, addressed me by my name, saying, "To what end lovest thou this lady, seeing that thou canst not support her presence?
The first part is a proem to the words following.
And that every vicious thought may be discarded herefrom, let the reader remember that it is above written that the greeting of this lady, which was an act of her mouth, was the goal of my desires, while I could receive it.
In the first, I tell what is understood of her in heaven.
And for that the occasion of what I then wrote may be found pleasant in the hearing, I will relate it as briefly as I may.
But albeit I spake not to her again, yet it behoved me afterward to write of another matter, more noble than the foregoing.

seventeen.
Organ of rut, not reason, is the lord Who from the body politic doth drain Lust for himself, instead of toil and pain, Leaving us lean as crickets on dry sward. Well too if he like Love would filch our hoard With pleasure to ourselves, sluicing our vein And vigour to perpetuate the strain Of life by spilth of life within us stored! Love's cheat yields joy and profit.

eighteen.
Repent; be wise! Man fights but ill with Him who rules the skies.
These things gave you birth: So have they mind and God.
twenty five.
But my bell hath broke Her silence.
twenty six.
Yield, thou deaf, blind, tainted beast, To the wise fervour of a blameless mind!
All crime is its own torment, bearing woe To mind or body or decrease of fame; If not at once, still step by step our name Or blood or friends or fortune it brings low. But if our will do not resent the blow, We have not sinned.
twenty three.
The choice of arms was thine; Yet art thou scoffed at by the crucified! He lives-thy loss.
She that was thine excellent lady hath been taken out of life." Then I began to weep very piteously; and not only in mine imagination, but with mine eyes, which were wet with tears.
A few days after this, my body became afflicted with a painful infirmity, whereby I suffered bitter anguish for many days, which at last brought me unto such weakness that I could no longer move.
In the first, speaking to a person undefined, I tell how I was aroused from a vain phantasy by certain ladies, and how I promised them to tell what it was.
Just then you woke me, of your complaisaunce."
The second part begins here, "Saying, 'Be now;'" the third here, "Then, while it was his pleasure." The third part divides into two.
And I remember that on the ninth day, being overcome with intolerable pain, a thought came into my mind concerning my lady: but when it had a little nourished this thought, my mind returned to its brooding over mine enfeebled body.
The second part begins here, "I was a thinking." The first part divides into two.
And as I said these words, with a painful anguish of sobbing and another prayer unto Death, a young and gentle lady, who had been standing beside me where I lay, conceiving that I wept and cried out because of the pain of mine infirmity, was taken with trembling and began to shed tears.
And so strong was my phantasy, that I wept again in very truth, and said with my true voice: "O excellent soul! how blessed is he that now looketh upon thee!"
After this empty imagining, it happened on a day, as I sat thoughtful, that I was taken with such a strong trembling at the heart, that it could not have been otherwise in the presence of my lady.
"And I became so humble in my grief, Seeing in her such deep humility, That I said: 'Death, I hold thee passing good Henceforth, and a most gentle sweet relief, Since my dear love has chosen to dwell with thee: Pity, not hate, is thine, well understood. Lo!
Then my heart that was so full of love said unto me: "It is true that our lady lieth dead;" and it seemed to me that I went to look upon the body wherein that blessed and most noble spirit had had its abiding place.
Whereby other ladies, who were about the room, becoming aware of my discomfort by reason of the moan that she made, (who indeed was of my very near kindred,) led her away from where I was, and then set themselves to awaken me, thinking that I dreamed, and saying: "Sleep no longer, and be not disquieted."
In the second, I tell what these ladies said to me after I had left off this wandering: and it begins here, "But uttered in a voice." Then, when I say, "I was a thinking," I say how I told them this my imagination; and concerning this I have two parts.
Wherefore come now unto me who do greatly desire thee: seest thou not that I wear thy colour already?" And when I had seen all those offices performed that are fitting to be done unto the dead, it seemed to me that I went back unto mine own chamber, and looked up towards Heaven.
Also, after I had recovered from my sickness, I bethought me to write these things in rhyme; deeming it a lovely thing to be known.
A short while after these words which my heart spoke to me with the tongue of Love, I saw coming towards me a certain lady who was very famous for her beauty, and of whom that friend whom I have already called the first among my friends had long been enamoured.
In the second, I say how I told them.
I do so desire to see thy face That I am like as one who nears the tomb; My soul entreats thee, Come.' Then I departed, having made my moan; And when I was alone I said, and cast my eyes to the High Place: 'Blessed is he, fair soul, who meets thy glance!' ...
The third tells how, after he had in such wise been with me a space, I saw and heard certain things.
Whereof I wrote this poem:--
In the first, I tell, in order, this imagination.
The second says how it appeared to me that Love spake within my heart, and what was his aspect.
"I smile at your question," was the answer of the Wind.
Alas! what he said was true; and before many days had passed, the shattered Carnations were rotted with lying in the wet and dirt on the ground.
The Convolvulus fared still worse.
Indeed, not a flower escaped his mischievous suggestions.
The white Lily still stood somewhat upright, though no friendly pole supported her juicy stem; but, alas! it was only by a painful effort she could hold herself in that position.
"I am not thinking about the garden, mamma," replied the young girl, without lifting up her face; "we can plant new flowers, and tie up even some of these afresh.
"Not more than mine does!" cried the proud white Lily, leaning as heavily as she could against the strip of matting that tied her to her stick.
Then the Wind took another frolic round the garden, and made up to the large white Lily, into whose refined ear he whispered a doubt as to the necessity or advantage of her thick powerful stem being propped up against a stupid, ugly stick!
Sometimes she takes a turn upon the ground; sometimes she enters a hedge, and plays at bo peep with the birds in the thorn and nut trees-twisting here, curling there, and at last, perhaps, coming out at the top, and overhanging the edge with a canopy of green leaves and pretty white flowers.
Making a sort of eddying circuit round the garden, he knocked over the Convolvulus pole, tore the strips from the stick that held up the white Lily, loosed all the Carnation flowers from their fastenings, broke the Rose Tree down, and levelled the Sweet Peas to the ground.
Really, with your natural grace and beauty, I think you might be trusted to yourself a little more!"
Now the Convolvulus was quite abashed by the words of the Wind, for she was conscious of feeling very conceited that morning, in consequence of having heard the gardener say something very flattering about her beauty; so she hung down her rich bell flowers rather lower than usual, and made no reply.
Before the day closed, the gardener came whistling from his farm work, to look over his pretty charges.
"Perhaps I am prejudiced; but as to be deprived of freedom would be to me absolute death, so my soul revolts from every shape and phase of slavery!"
But for the sight that awaited him he was not prepared at all. Struck dumb with astonishment, he never spoke at first, but kept lifting up the heads of the trailing, dirtied flowers in succession.
In short, in one half hour he desolated the pretty garden; and when his work was accomplished, he flew off.
To which the wicked Wind, seeing that his temptations had succeeded, replied, in great glee, that he would do his best; and so he went away, chuckling at the discontent he had caused.
But I cannot say so, now I see the result.
Presently, with sorrowing steps, she bent her way round the flower beds, weeping afresh at every one she looked at; and then she sat down upon the lawn, and hid her face in her hands. In this position she remained, until a gentle hand was laid upon her shoulder.
THE WIND AND THE FLOWERS
"This is a sad sight, indeed, my darling," said her mother's voice.
Then the white Lily called out to him in great wrath, and told him he mistook their characters altogether.
At length, one day before the fortnight was over, the house dog was heard to bark his noisy welcome, and servants bustled to and fro. The mistress had returned; and the young lady was with her, and hurried at once to her favourite garden.
And what is the matter with the beautiful straggling branches, that they are to be cut off as fast as they appear?
I have been watching your friend the gardener for some time to day; and now that he is gone at last, I am quite curious to hear what you think and feel about your unnatural bringing up."
Why must every single flower betied up by its delicate neck to a stick, the moment it begins to open?
By mrs Alfred Gatty
She came bounding towards the well-known spot with a song of joyous delight; but, on reaching it, suddenly stopped short, and in a minute after burst into a flood of tears!
"With my natural grace and beauty," repeated she to herself, "they might certainly trust me to myself a little more!"
Why not allow the healthy Rose Tree its free and glorious growth?
The Honeysuckle escaped no better; and the Carnation was ready to die of vexation, at finding that her coveted freedom had levelled her to the dirt.
Oh that she were once more climbing up the friendly fir pole!
Weeds meanwhile sprang up, and a dreary confusion reigned in the once orderly and brilliant little garden.
The Wind was scarcely gone before a sudden and heavy rain followed, so that all was confusion for some time.
My young plants require heat, or they would not live; and the pots we are kept in protect us from those cruel wire worms who delight to destroy our roots."
But towards the evening the weather cleared up, and our friends began to look around them.
He murmured among them all-laughed the trim cut Box edges to scorn-maliciously hoped the Sweet Peas enjoyed growing in a circle, and running up a quantity of crooked sticks-and told the flowers, generally, that he should report their unheard of submission and meek obedience wherever he went.
"You surely cannot suppose that in a natural state you would be forced to climb regularly up one tall bare stick such as I see you upon now.
I quite feel for you!
They only submitted to these degrading restraints because they could not help themselves; but if he would lend them his powerful aid, they might free themselves from at least a part of the unnatural bonds which enthralled them.
He really grieved to see it!
She felt the muddy weight as it soaked into her beautiful velvet bells, and could have cried for grief: she could never free herself from this nuisance.
Why not allow your silver tufts to luxuriate in a natural manner?
The garden beds sloped towards the south; and when our friend was laid on the earth-her pole having fallen-her lovely flowers were choked up by the wet soil which drained towards her.
He managed the affair very cleverly, it must be confessed.
She runs along and climbs about, just as the whim takes her.
Oh, Rose Tree, you know your own surpassing merits too well to make you think this possible!"
And so she did, and a new light seemed to dawn upon her as she recollected the spring and autumnal prunings she regularly underwent, and the quantities of little branches that were yearly cut from her sides, and carried away in a wheel barrow.
"Always this tying up and restraint!" pursued the Wind, with an angry puff.
I am not aware that I have any poor relations in this country, and I myself certainly require all the care that is bestowed upon me. This climate is both too cold and too damp for me.
It's all over with them, I fear;" and the gardener went his way.
Meanwhile, how fared it with the flowers?
And the Carnation began to think so, too; and her colour turned deeper as a feeling of indignation arose within her at the childish treatment to which she had been subjected.
"What a fuss is made about you, my dear little friends!" murmured the Wind, one day, to the flowers in a pretty villa garden.
Did that lovely creature suppose that Nature, who had done so much for her that the fame of her beauty extended throughout the world, had yet left her so weak and feeble that she could not support herself in the position most calculated to give her ease and pleasure?
What a difference in size, in colour and in fragrance!
"It is rather a silly thing to do," said Deucalion; "and yet there can be no harm in it, and we shall see what will happen."
And yet what could he mean by the bones of our mother?"
"Perhaps he meant the stones of the earth," said Pyrrha.
"Is there anything that you wish?" he asked.
"These men," he said to his mighty company, "are nothing but a source of trouble.
When they were good and happy, we felt afraid lest they should become greater than ourselves; and now they are so terribly wicked that we are in worse danger than before.
Once every year he had gone to the land of the Caucasus to talk with his father, who was hanging chained to the mountain peak.
"Let us go on down the mountain, and as we go, let us pick up the stones in our path and throw them over our shoulders behind us."
"But let us think a moment.
While they were talking and trying to think what they should do, they heard a voice behind them.
"Surely I do not know," said Deucalion.
Be sure that you are ready for it, my son."
Who is our mother, if it is not the Earth, from whom all living things have sprung?
He drew near, trembling and wondering, and knelt beside her.
The king, in hopes of preventing what the old fairy had foretold, immediately issued an edict by which he forbade all persons in his dominion from spinning or even having spindles in their houses under pain of instant death.
Then the prince took the princess by the hand; she was dressed in great splendour, but he did not hint that she looked as he had seen pictures of his great grandmother look; he thought her all the more charming for that.
The turn of the old fairy had now come, and she declared, while her head shook with malice, that the princess should pierce her hand with a spindle and die of the wound. This dreadful fate threw all the company into tears of dismay, when the young fairy who had hidden herself came forward and said:
When they left the castle the next day to return to the prince's home, they were followed by all the retinue of the princess.
The young prince at these words felt himself on fire.
He walked toward the castle, which appeared now at the end of a long avenue, but when he turned to, look for his followers not one was to be seen; the woods had closed instantly upon him as he had passed through.
His steps resounded as he passed over the marble pavement and up the marble staircase.
The son of the king was hunting one day when he discovered the towers of the castle above the tops of the trees, and asked what castle that was.
The king looked sorrowfully upon her.
"How do you do it?
The prince did not know what to believe, when finally an old peasant said:
It is true I cannot entirely undo what my elder has done.
Outside they met the prince's followers, who were overjoyed to see their master. He turned to show them the castle, but behold! there was no castle to be seen, and no wood; castle and wood had vanished, but the prince and princess went gayly away, and when the old king and queen died they reigned in their stead.
When at last the queen gave birth to a daughter the king was so overjoyed that he gave a great christening feast, the like of which had never before been known.
Once upon a time there was a king and a queen who grieved sorely that they had no children.
Give it to me that I may see if I can do it." She had no sooner taken up the spindle, than, being hasty and careless, she pierced her hand with the point of it, and fainted away.
At that moment, the enchantment being ended, the princess awoke, and, looking drowsily and tenderly at the young man, said:
But the faces of the men were rosy, and the goblets by them had a few drops of wine left.
"Be of good cheer, king and queen; your daughter shall not so die.
The king came forward to receive her and showed his grief.
All manner of answers were given to him.
Even the spits before the fire, laden with partridges and pheasants, went to sleep, and the fire itself went to sleep also.
"Have you come, my prince?
They passed into a hall of mirrors, where they supped, attended by the officers of the princess. The violins and haut boys played old but excellent pieces of music, and after supper, to lose no time, the grand almoner married the royal lovers in the chapel of the castle.
He asked all the fairies in the land-there were seven all told-to stand godmothers to the little princess, hoping that each might give her a gift, and so she should have all imaginable perfections.
It was the work of a moment.
She touched the governesses, maids of honour, women of the bedchamber, gentlemen, officers, stewards, cooks, scullions, boys, guards, porters, pages, footmen; she touched the horses in the stable with their grooms, the great mastiffs in the court yard, and even little Pouste, the tiny lap dog of the princess that was on the bed beside her.
He had not a moment's doubt that he was destined to this great adventure, and full of ardour he determined at once to set out for the castle.
The youngest, for her gift, decreed that she should be the most beautiful person in the world; the next that she should have the mind of an angel; the third that she should be perfectly graceful; the fourth that she should dance admirably well; the fifth, that she should sing like a nightingale; the sixth, that she should play charmingly upon every musical instrument.
He passed through one apartment after another, where were ladies and gentlemen asleep in their chairs or standing.
The lady in waiting became very impatient, and at length announced to the princess that they all waited for her.
The king and queen kissed their daughter farewell and left the castle, issuing a proclamation that no person whatsoever was to approach it.
A hundred years went by, and the kingdom was in the hands of another royal family.
"I am spinning, my fair child," said the old woman, who did not know her.
Her hand lay upon her breast, and he touched his lips to it.
He knew that she would not awake for a hundred years.
Before each was set a magnificent plate, with a gold knife and a gold fork studded with diamonds and rubies.
People came running in from all sides; they threw water in the princess's face and did all they could to restore her, but nothing would bring her to.
But he managed to assure her of his love, and they soon forgot all else as they talked and talked.
The sleep will last a hundred years, and at the end of that time a king's son will come to wake her."
The princess will pierce her hand with a spindle, but, instead of dying, she will only fall into a deep sleep.
The prince was overjoyed at the words, and at the tender voice and look, and scarcely knew how to speak.
The fairies now began to endow the princess.
She touched with her wand everybody that was in the castle, except the king and queen.
"What are you doing?" asked the princess.
The good fairy who had saved her life and turned her death into sleep was in the kingdom of Mataquin, twelve thousand leagues away, when this happened, but she learned of it from a dwarf who had a pair of seven league boots, and instantly set out for the castle, where she arrived in an hour, drawn by dragons in a fiery chariot.
That was needless, for in a quarter of an hour there had grown up about it a wood so thick and filled with thorns that nothing could get at the castle, and the castle top itself could only be seen from a great distance.
They marched down the long avenue, and the wood opened again to let them pass.
"How pretty it is!" exclaimed the princess.
So this is what she did.
The men had plainly fallen asleep.
He entered the guard room; there the guards stood drawn up in line with carbines at their shoulders, but they were sound asleep.
The good fairy was very wise and saw that the princess when she woke would find herself all alone in that great castle and everything about her would be strange.
"The water," said I, "and the forest's sound, Are combating within me my new faith In something which I heard opposed to this."
Its tresses, which so much the more dilate As higher they ascend, had been by Indians Among their forests marvelled at for height.
And saw their school diminished by the loss Not only of Elias, but of Moses, And the apparel of their Master changed;
For such a prayer, 'twas said unto me, "Pray Matilda that she tell thee;" and here answered, As one does who doth free himself from blame,
Nor even thus our way continued far Before the lady wholly turned herself Unto me, saying, "Brother, look and listen!"
And Beatrice, compassionate and sighing, Listened to them with such a countenance, That scarce more changed was Mary at the cross.
And so much power the stricken plant possesses That with its virtue it impregns the air, And this, revolving, scatters it around;
The ladies seven at a dark shadow's edge, Such as, beneath green leaves and branches black, The Alp upon its frigid border wears.
She, on the right-hand border of the car Still firmly standing, to those holy beings Thus her discourse directed afterwards:
I saw upon its right wing wheeled about The glorious host returning with the sun And with the sevenfold flames upon their faces.
Therefore my answer is with greater care, That he may hear me who is weeping yonder, So that the sin and dole be of one measure.
But so much more malignant and more savage Becomes the land untilled and with bad seed, The more good earthly vigour it possesses.
Think, Reader, if within myself I marvelled, When I beheld the thing itself stand still, And in its image it transformed itself.
When from the flesh to spirit I ascended, And beauty and virtue were in me increased, I was to him less dear and less delightful;
Underneath which had she devoutly stayed, I sooner should have tasted those delights Ineffable, and for a longer time.
"O thou who art beyond the sacred river," Turning to me the point of her discourse, That edgewise even had seemed to me so keen,
And lo! a sudden lustre ran across On every side athwart the spacious forest, Such that it made me doubt if it were lightning.
Thus Beatrice; and I, who at the feet Of her commandments all devoted was, My mind and eyes directed where she willed.
As soon as on my vision smote the power Sublime, that had already pierced me through Ere from my boyhood I had yet come forth,
But when I had approached so near to them The common object, which the sense deceives, Lost not by distance any of its marks,
The callow birdlet waits for two or three, But to the eyes of those already fledged, In vain the net is spread or shaft is shot."
And Beatrice: "Perhaps a greater care, Which oftentimes our memory takes away, Has made the vision of his mind obscure.
Then forth she drew me, and all dripping brought Into the dance of the four beautiful, And each one with her arm did cover me.
The ice, that was about my heart congealed, To air and water changed, and in my anguish Through mouth and eyes came gushing from my breast.
Even as in heaven star followeth after star, There came close after them four animals, Incoronate each one with verdant leaf.
But issues from a fountain safe and certain, Which by the will of God as much regains As it discharges, open on two sides.
Plumed with six wings was every one of them, The plumage full of eyes; the eyes of Argus If they were living would be such as these.
Up to my throat she in the stream had drawn me, And, dragging me behind her, she was moving Upon the water lightly as a shuttle.
Even as a cross bow breaks, when 'tis discharged Too tensely drawn the bowstring and the bow, And with less force the arrow hits the mark,
And now they seemed conducted by the white, Now by the red, and from the song of her The others took their step, or slow or swift.
Therefore I pass to what time I awoke, And say a splendour rent from me the veil Of slumber, and a calling: "Rise, what dost thou?"
My faculties were in so great confusion, That the voice moved, but sooner was extinct Than by its organs it was set at large.
But read ezekiel, who depicteth them As he beheld them from the region cold Coming with cloud, with whirlwind, and with fire;
The faculty that lends discourse to reason Did apprehend that they were candlesticks, And in the voices of the song "Hosanna!"
Whoever pillages or shatters it, With blasphemy of deed offendeth God, Who made it holy for his use alone.
Behold the company that circles her; The rest behind the Griffin are ascending With more melodious song, and more profound."
But us Virgilius of himself deprived Had left, Virgilius, sweetest of all fathers, Virgilius, to whom I for safety gave me:
But because she her wanton, roving eye Turned upon me, her angry paramour Did scourge her from her head unto her feet.
Some time did I sustain him with my look; Revealing unto him my youthful eyes, I led him with me turned in the right way.
Thou by so many circumstances only The justice of the interdict of God Morally in the tree wouldst recognize.
And if her speech were more diffuse I know not, Because already in my sight was she Who from the hearing of aught else had shut me.
While with amazement filled and jubilant, My soul was tasting of the food, that while It satisfies us makes us hunger for it,
Then, when the heart restored my outward sense, The lady I had found alone, above me I saw, and she was saying, "Hold me, hold me."
Alone she sat upon the very earth, Left there as guardian of the chariot Which I had seen the biform monster fasten.
Cast down the seed of weeping and attend; So shalt thou hear, how in an opposite way My buried flesh should have directed thee.
Over her snow white veil with olive cinct Appeared a lady under a green mantle, Vested in colour of the living flame.
Not only Rome with no such splendid car E'er gladdened Africanus, or Augustus, But poor to it that of the Sun would be,--
As soon as I was with her as I should be, She said to me: "Why, brother, dost thou not Venture to question now, in coming with me?"
Thou makest me remember where and what Proserpina that moment was when lost Her mother her, and she herself the Spring."
But since the lightning ceases as it comes, And that continuing brightened more and more, Within my thought I said, "What thing is this?"
In rear of all the group here treated of Two old men I beheld, unlike in habit, But like in gait, each dignified and grave.
Such had this man become in his new life Potentially, that every righteous habit Would have made admirable proof in him;
Note thou; and even as by me are uttered These words, so teach them unto those who live That life which is a running unto death;
They all were saying, "Benedictus qui venis," And, scattering flowers above and round about, "Manibus o date lilia plenis."
And my own spirit, that already now So long a time had been, that in her presence Trembling with awe it had not stood abashed,
A softly breathing air, that no mutation Had in itself, upon the forehead smote me No heavier blow than of a gentle wind,
Within which a Five hundred, Ten, and Five, One sent from God, shall slay the thievish woman And that same giant who is sinning with her.
Thereafter four I saw of humble aspect, And behind all an aged man alone Walking in sleep with countenance acute.

But still, that thou mayst feel a greater shame For thy transgression, and another time Hearing the Sirens thou mayst be more strong,
And the sun's face, uprising, overshadowed So that by tempering influence of vapours For a long interval the eye sustained it;
Purgatorio: Canto twenty nine
When forcibly my sight was turned away Towards my left hand by those goddesses, Because I heard from them a "Too intently!"
It me befell, that without perfect sound Began I: "My necessity, Madonna, You know, and that which thereunto is good."
As soon as she was where the grasses are. Bathed by the waters of the beauteous river, To lift her eyes she granted me the boon.
Truly from this time forward shall my words Be naked, so far as it is befitting To lay them open unto thy rude gaze."
With feet I stayed, and with mine eyes I passed Beyond the rivulet, to look upon The great variety of the fresh may.
Then backward did I turn me wholly round Unto my Poets, and saw that with a smile They had been listening to these closing words;
Already my slow steps had carried me Into the ancient wood so far, that I Could not perceive where I had entered it.
Mine eyes fell downward into the clear fountain, But, seeing myself therein, I sought the grass, So great a shame did weigh my forehead down.
And as my countenance was lifted up, Mine eye perceived those creatures beautiful Had rested from the strewing of the flowers;
Weeping I said: "The things that present were With their false pleasure turned aside my steps, Soon as your countenance concealed itself."
Even as children silent in their shame Stand listening with their eyes upon the ground, And conscious of their fault, and penitent;
Three maidens at the right wheel in a circle Came onward dancing; one so very red That in the fire she hardly had been noted.
For this I visited the gates of death, And unto him, who so far up has led him, My intercessions were with weeping borne.
The Good Supreme, sole in itself delighting, Created man good, and this goodly place Gave him as hansel of eternal peace.
And into ways untrue he turned his steps, Pursuing the false images of good, That never any promises fulfil;

And such as thou shalt find them in his pages, Such were they here; saving that in their plumage john is with me, and differeth from him.
When I was near unto the blessed shore, "Asperges me," I heard so sweetly sung, Remember it I cannot, much less write it.
Such self conviction stung me at the heart O'erpowered I fell, and what I then became She knoweth who had furnished me the cause.
Purgatorio: Canto thirty two
And if from smoke a fire may be inferred, Such an oblivion clearly demonstrates Some error in thy will elsewhere intent.
So was I standing; and she said: "If thou In hearing sufferest pain, lift up thy beard And thou shalt feel a greater pain in seeing."
peter and john and james conducted were, And, overcome, recovered at the word By which still greater slumbers have been broken,
And upward he extended both his wings Between the middle list and three and three, So that he injured none by cleaving it.
"Blessed art thou, O Griffin, who dost not Pluck with thy beak these branches sweet to taste, Since appetite by this was turned to evil."
Purgatorio: Canto thirty one
"Dante, because Virgilius has departed Do not weep yet, do not weep yet awhile; For by another sword thou need'st must weep."
Motionless halted, the veracious people, That came at first between it and the Griffin, Turned themselves to the car, as to their peace.
And I beheld the flamelets onward go, Leaving behind themselves the air depicted, And they of trailing pennons had the semblance,
The interval between these four contained A chariot triumphal on two wheels, Which by a Griffin's neck came drawn along;
So I gave way beneath that heavy burden, Outpouring in a torrent tears and sighs, And the voice flagged upon its passage forth.
May the desire come unto thee to draw Near to this river's bank," I said to her, "So much that I might hear what thou art singing.
Then back I turned my face to those high things, Which moved themselves towards us so sedately, They had been distanced by new wedded brides.
Even as the Blessed at the final summons Shall rise up quickened each one from his cavern, Uplifting light the reinvested flesh,
I heard them murmur altogether, "Adam!" Then circled they about a tree despoiled Of blooms and other leafage on each bough.
So that it overhead remained distinct With sevenfold lists, all of them of the colours Whence the sun's bow is made, and Delia's girdle.
And there appeared to me (even as appears Suddenly something that doth turn aside Through very wonder every other thought)
That soldiery of the celestial kingdom Which marched in the advance had wholly passed us Before the chariot had turned its pole.
And I: "As by a signet is the wax Which does not change the figure stamped upon it, My brain is now imprinted by yourself.
Beneath her veil, beyond the margent green, She seemed to me far more her ancient self To excel, than others here, when she was here.
Less than of rose and more than violet A hue disclosing, was renewed the tree That had erewhile its boughs so desolate.
In grace do us the grace that thou unveil Thy face to him, so that he may discern The second beauty which thou dost conceal."
To the left hand I turned with that reliance With which the little child runs to his mother, When he has fear, or when he is afflicted,
Then all the seven in front of her she placed; And after her, by beckoning only, moved Me and the lady and the sage who stayed.
I do not think there shone so great a light Under the lids of Venus, when transfixed By her own son, beyond his usual custom!
As soon as ever of my second age I was upon the threshold and changed life, Himself from me he took and gave to others.
Than I upraised at her command my chin; And when she by the beard the face demanded, Well I perceived the venom of her meaning.
Erect upon the other bank she smiled, Bearing full many colours in her hands, Which that high land produces without seed.
Thus singing they began; and afterwards Unto the Griffin's breast they led me with them, Where Beatrice was standing, turned towards us.
I saw the Lady, who erewhile appeared Veiled underneath the angelic festival, Direct her eyes to me across the river.
And when the car was opposite to me Thunder was heard; and all that folk august Seemed to have further progress interdicted,
But when I heard in their sweet melodies Compassion for me, more than had they said, "O wherefore, lady, dost thou thus upbraid him?"
In front of them the Tigris and Euphrates Methought I saw forth issue from one fountain, And slowly part, like friends, from one another.
And as a wasp that draweth back its sting, Drawing unto himself his tail malign, Drew out the floor, and went his way rejoicing.
Then to the wheels the maidens turned themselves, And the Griffin moved his burden benedight, But so that not a feather of him fluttered.
And turning to the pole which he had dragged, He drew it close beneath the widowed bough, And what was of it unto it left bound.
Reader! to trace their forms no more I waste My rhymes; for other spendings press me so, That I in this cannot be prodigal.
But by the largess of celestial graces, Which have such lofty vapours for their rain That near to them our sight approaches not,
By his default short while he sojourned here; By his default to weeping and to toil He changed his innocent laughter and sweet play.
Therefore, for that world's good which liveth ill, Fix on the car thine eyes, and what thou seest, Having returned to earth, take heed thou write."
Even as a painter who from model paints I would portray how I was lulled asleep; He may, who well can picture drowsihood.
Between her steps and mine were not a hundred, When equally the margins gave a turn, In such a way, that to the East I faced.
More hatred from Leander did not suffer For rolling between Sestos and Abydos, Than that from me, because it oped not then.
The first were horned like oxen; but the four Had but a single horn upon the forehead; A monster such had never yet been seen!
The lady chid me: "Why dost thou burn only So with affection for the living lights, And dost not look at what comes after them?"
Apart three paces did the river make us; But Hellespont, where Xerxes passed across, (A curb still to all human arrogance,)
Confusion and dismay together mingled Forced such a Yes! from out my mouth, that sight Was needful to the understanding of it.
The lady fair who drew me through the ford Followed with Statius and myself the wheel Which made its orbit with the lesser arc.
I will too, if not written, at least painted, Thou bear it back within thee, for the reason That cinct with palm the pilgrim's staff is borne."
Whence her I answered: "I do not remember That ever I estranged myself from you, Nor have I conscience of it that reproves me."
So high they rose that they were lost to sight; His limbs were gold, so far as he was bird, And white the others with vermilion mingled.
So I revived, and saw that piteous one Above me standing, who had been conductress Aforetime of my steps beside the river,
And one of them, as if by Heaven commissioned, Singing, "Veni, sponsa, de Libano" Shouted three times, and all the others after.
Now Helicon must needs pour forth for me, And with her choir Urania must assist me, To put in verse things difficult to think.
After this fashion round the tree robust The others shouted; and the twofold creature: "Thus is preserved the seed of all the just."
But with full ravishment the hours of prime, Singing, received they in the midst of leaves, That ever bore a burden to their rhymes,
"Ye are new comers; and because I smile," Began she, "peradventure, in this place Elect to human nature for its nest,
"Short while shalt thou be here a forester, And thou shalt be with me for evermore A citizen of that Rome where Christ is Roman.
Yet not from their upright direction swayed, So that the little birds upon their tops Should leave the practice of each art of theirs;
So pricked me then the thorn of penitence, That of all other things the one which turned me Most to its love became the most my foe.
So she moved onward; and I do not think That her tenth step was placed upon the ground, When with her eyes upon mine eyes she smote,
Nor prayer for inspiration me availed, By means of which in dreams and otherwise I called him back, so little did he heed them.
Thereafter saw I leap into the body Of the triumphal vehicle a Fox, That seemed unfed with any wholesome food.
Some apprehension keeps you marvelling; But the psalm 'Delectasti' giveth light Which has the power to uncloud your intellect.
Purgatorio: Canto twenty eight
It should not seem a marvel then on earth, This being heard, whenever any plant Without seed manifest there taketh root.
O Virgins sacrosanct! if ever hunger, Vigils, or cold for you I have endured, The occasion spurs me their reward to claim!
But wherefore so beyond my power of sight Soars your desirable discourse, that aye The more I strive, so much the more I lose it?"
Even so, when she had taken hold of me, The beautiful lady moved, and unto Statius Said, in her womanly manner, "Come with him."
Then by the way that it before had come, Into the chariot's chest I saw the Eagle Descend, and leave it feathered with his plumes.
The beautiful lady opened wide her arms, Embraced my head, and plunged me underneath, Where I was forced to swallow of the water.
"But," said Morrel, "the culprit-the murderer-the assassin."
But he stopped on the landing; he had not the courage to again visit the death chamber.
But in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight.
Villefort rose, half ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of grief.
"Sir," cried Morrel, seizing the moist hand of the paralytic, "they ask me who I am, and what right I have to be here.
The procureur?"
"Yes."
"no"
Villefort met them at the door of his study; having in a few words thanked the district doctor, he turned to d'Avrigny, and said,--"And now the priest."
"See, my father, see!"
He therefore approached the bed, and while his companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in chloride of lime, he uncovered the calm and pale face, which looked like that of a sleeping angel.
"no" said Villefort; "fetch the nearest."
"Yes," indicated the old man.
"Yes."
"Gentlemen," he said in a hoarse voice, "give me your word of honor that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves!" The two men drew back.
"Gentlemen," said Morrel, reading all that passed through the minds of the witnesses to the scene, "I know what I am saying, and you know as well as I do what I am about to say-Valentine has been assassinated!" Villefort hung his head, d'Avrigny approached nearer, and Noirtier said "Yes" with his eyes.
The district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead; he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face, and just unclosed the lips.
The terrible office he had held for twenty five years had succeeded in making him more or less than man.
Villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man, who, almost a stranger to him, called Noirtier his father.
"Yes, yes," continued Morrel; "recall the scene, for the words you thought were only given to silence and solitude fell into my ears.
"Oh," said Villefort, inexpressibly delighted to think that the inquiries were to be made by him alone,--"oh, be satisfied, I can understand my father." D'Avrigny took the young man's arm, and led him out of the room.
At the end of a quarter of an hour a faltering footstep was heard, and Villefort appeared at the door of the apartment where d'Avrigny and Morrel had been staying, one absorbed in meditation, the other in grief.
"I know it, sir; the servants who fled from the house informed me.
"Yes."
For some temperaments work is a remedy for all afflictions.
The doctor of the dead then laid his permit on the corner of the table, and having fulfilled his duty, was conducted out by d'Avrigny.
"But can he understand you?"
"no"
Valentine now requires only the ministrations of the priest."
"Thank you, sir," said d'Avrigny; "since you have commenced your sacred office, deign to continue it.
"Do you wish to see him?"
Take a last farewell, sir, of her sad remains; take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own, and then separate yourself from her forever.
I am stricken by fate.
"I am going, sir; and I do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than mine." D'Avrigny took the priest's hand, and without meeting Villefort, who was engaged in his study, they reached Valentine's room, which on the following night was to be occupied by the undertakers.
"I only wish to be alone.
It was something terrible to witness the silent agony, the mute despair of Noirtier, whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks.
I tell you that the dose has been double, the poison changed, and that this time it has succeeded.
"The doctor?"
As the doctors entered the street, they saw a man in a cassock standing on the threshold of the next door.
"My father has revealed the culprit's name; my father thirsts for revenge as much as you do, yet even he conjures you as I do to keep this secret.
D'Avrigny accosted the priest.
"Who are you, sir," he asked, "that forget that this is not the manner to enter a house stricken with death? Go, sir, go!" But Morrel remained motionless; he could not detach his eyes from that disordered bed, and the pale corpse of the young girl who was lying on it.
"Sir," said Villefort, striving to struggle against this triple force and his own emotion,--"sir, you are deceived; no one commits crimes here.
One could have thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding death.
The two doctors, therefore, entered the room alone.
"I tell you, sir, that two persons exist in you; the father has mourned sufficiently, now let the procureur fulfil his office."
Noirtier was near the bed, pale, motionless, and silent as the corpse.
"Alas," said d'Avrigny, "she is indeed dead, poor child!"
But you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left this earth-she has nothing more to do with the adoration of men.
"Oh, you rave, sir," exclaimed Villefort, in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was taken.
And the cry issued from his pores, if we may thus speak-a cry frightful in its silence. D'Avrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful restorative.
"And I say that murders are committed here," said Morrel, whose voice, though lower in tone, lost none of its terrible distinctness: "I tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four months.
"Is there any particular priest you wish to pray with Valentine?" asked d'Avrigny.
"It is a young girl."
"Go!--do you hear?" said Villefort, while d'Avrigny advanced to lead Morrel out.
Villefort continued: "He knows me, and I have pledged my word to him.
We have before stated that all the servants had fled.
Is it not so, father?"
Morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him.
"Yes," replied Noirtier.
Maximilian.
Tell them-oh, tell them, that corpse belongs to me!"
Noirtier wishes to speak."
"Yes," replied Noirtier with an expression of sinister joy.
His glance, at first wandering, fixed itself upon Morrel.
You will excuse me, will you not?
"I was about to offer myself, sir," said the priest; "it is our mission to forestall our duties."
At length, happier than the young man, who sobbed without weeping, tears glistened in the eyes of Noirtier.
"Do you wish me to leave?" said Morrel, sadly.
"And will you direct us?" exclaimed the young man.
"See what they have done!" cried Morrel, with one hand leaning on the back of the chair, and the other extended towards Valentine.
Do you not, father?"
"Ah," said the priest, in a marked Italian accent; "yes, I have heard that death is in that house."
"You can come," he said, and led them back to Noirtier. Morrel looked attentively on Villefort.
mr Procureur," said Morrel with increasing vehemence, "no mercy is allowed; I denounce the crime; it is your place to seek the assassin." The young man's implacable eyes interrogated Villefort, who, on his side, glanced from Noirtier to d'Avrigny.
"Yes," replied Noirtier.
The eyes of Noirtier glistened, and d'Avrigny approached.
"Alas, alas, sir, have pity on me!"
"Do not alarm yourself, sir; justice will be done," said Villefort.
"Sir," he said, "are you disposed to confer a great obligation on an unhappy father who has just lost his daughter?
CHAPTER nine.
One must appeal to immense opposing forces, in order to thwart this natural, all too natural PROGRESSUS IN SIMILE, the evolution of man to the similar, the ordinary, the average, the gregarious-to the IGNOBLE-!
Be natural!
The three friends were astounded.
I declared myself quite willing, for it was necessary to brazen it out, after having ventured as far as I had done.
I confess candidly that I deceived them, as the Papa Deldimopulo used to deceive the Greeks who applied to him for the oracles of the Virgin.
In every one of the seventy two parishes of the city of Venice, there is a large public house called 'magazzino'.
We would very often spend the whole night rambling about the city, inventing and carrying into execution the most impertinent, practical jokes.
I played the violin in one of the numerous bands engaged for the balls which were given for three consecutive days in the Soranzo Palace.
The young woman's husband was a weaver by trade, and so were his two friends.
Our chief, a noble Venetian belonging to the Balbi family, said to us, "It would be a good joke to carry off those three blockheads, and to keep the pretty woman in our possession." He immediately explained his plan, and under cover of our masks we entered their room, Balbi at the head of us.
Whenever we could contrive to get into a church tower we thought it great fun to frighten all the parish by ringing the alarm bell, as if some fire had broken out; but that was not all, we always cut the bell ropes, so that in the morning the churchwardens had no means of summoning the faithful to early mass.
I rubbed it with all my strength, but he told me in a sort of indistinct whisper that the numbness was spreading all along the left side, and that he was dying.
An invincible self love would have prevented me from declaring myself unworthy of their friendship either by my ignorance or by my pride; and I should have been guilty of great rudeness if I had ceased to visit them.
We took our three prisoners to a large boat.
By scraping my violin I earned enough to keep myself without requiring anybody's assistance, and I have always thought that the man who can support himself is happy.
It was during the Carnival of seventeen forty five, after midnight; we were, all the eight of us, rambling about together with our masks on, in quest of some new sort of mischief to amuse us, and we went into the magazzino of the parish of the Holy Cross to get something to drink.
We intend only to take some refreshment at the Rialto, and then we will take you home in safety."
I jumped out of the gondola, and found myself on the very spot where three years before I had taught Razetta such a forcible lesson; I enquired for a surgeon at the first coffee house, and ran to the house that was pointed out to me.
I accepted gratefully, and sat down near him.
I threw myself at his feet to assure him of my gratitude, and embraced him calling him my father.
But what I could not, and probably never shall, understand, was the reason for which the Fathers, who were not so simple or so ignorant as our Evangelists, did not feel able to deny the divinity of oracles, and, in order to get out of the difficulty, ascribed them to the devil.
Our chief, as a matter of right, claims the privilege of opening the ball; and by dint of sweet words he overcomes the very natural repugnance she feels at consummating the sacrifice in so numerous company.
"Whoever you may be, I am indebted to you for my life.
Not one of us knew where Balbi wanted to take the three poor devils.
The offer of that reward would have made us tremble if our leader, precisely the one who alone had no interest in turning informer, had not been a patrician.
The complaint was candidly written and contained nothing but the truth, but the criminal portion of the truth was veiled by a circumstance which must have brought a smile on the grave countenances of the judges, and highly amused the public at large: the complaint setting forth that the eight masked men had not rendered themselves guilty of any act disagreeable to the wife.
The nobility, the merchants, even workmen in good circumstances, are never seen in the 'magazzino', for cleanliness is not exactly worshipped in such places.
"Never fear; you shall see him again to morrow."
I kept silent, looking very modest, but hardly able to control my mirth, whilst the doctor was staring at me with a mixture of astonishment and of spite, evidently thinking me some bold quack who had tried to supplant him.
They were in despair; they had enquired about the accident from the gondoliers, and having been told that I knew more than they did, they loaded me with questions which I answered.
You need not think of the future; think only of enjoying yourself, and take me as your adviser in everything that may happen to you, in everything you may wish to undertake, and you may be certain of always finding me your friend."
With an education which ought to have ensured me an honourable standing in the world, with some intelligence, wit, good literary and scientific knowledge, and endowed with those accidental physical qualities which are such a good passport into society, I found myself, at the age of twenty, the mean follower of a sublime art, in which, if great talent is rightly admired, mediocrity is as rightly despised.
This sententious answer struck them with astonishment, as I expected it would, and they looked at each other in great surprise.
We soon manage to reconcile her to her fate by the gallantry of our proceedings; encouraged by a good supper and by the stimulus of wine, prepared by our compliments and by a few kisses, she realizes what is in store for her, and does not seem to have any unconquerable objection.
He wrote the question, and gave it to me; I read it, I could not understand either the subject or the meaning of the words, but it did not matter, I had to give an answer.
"The hermit," remarked the senator, "has without informing you of it, linked an invisible spirit to the calculus he has taught you, for simple numbers can not have the power of reason.
When the play was over, I went with them to the drinking booth, which we often left intoxicated to spend the night in houses of ill fame.
Two days afterwards, our nocturnal orgy began to be talked of.
Yet there are a few private rooms which contain a table surrounded with benches, in which a respectable family or a few friends can enjoy themselves in a decent way.
We take off our masks, and the sight of eight young, healthy faces seems to please the beauty we had so unceremoniously carried off.
He entreated me to tell him the truth.
I might be told that if I had wished to follow the rules of pure morality I ought either to have declined intimate intercourse with them or to have undeceived them.
I was compelled by poverty to become a member of a musical band, in which I could expect neither esteem nor consideration, and I was well aware that I should be the laughing stock of the persons who had known me as a doctor in divinity, as an ecclesiastic, and as an officer in the army, and had welcomed me in the highest society.
It would be hard to say who was the more astonished: the doctor, when he saw an unknown young man, whom he must have taken for an impostor, declared more learned than himself; or I, when I saw myself transformed into a physician, at a moment's notice.
Your first protectors wanted to make you a priest, a doctor, an advocate, a soldier, and ended by making a fiddler of you; those persons did not know you.
The city was alive with complaints, and we laughed at the useless search made by the police to find out those who disturbed the peace of the inhabitants.
We did the same with physicians, whom we often sent half dressed to some nobleman who was enjoying excellent health.
I Turn Out A Worthless Fellow-My Good Fortune-I Become A Rich Nobleman
Their infatuation encouraging me, I spoke like a learned physician, I dogmatized, I quoted authors whom I had never read.
I was greatly frightened; I opened the curtain, took the lantern, and found him almost insensible, and the mouth drawn on one side.
After they had assured themselves of the reality of my cabalistic science by questions respecting the past, they decided to turn it to some use by consulting it upon the present and upon the future.
With all these oddities, the three friends were truly intelligent and even witty, and, at the beginning of my acquaintance with them, I could not reconcile these antagonistic points.
After this, the boatman is ordered to take us to Saint Genevieve, where we land, after paying for the boat.
It is the sum I used to receive from my father when I was your age.
An hour later, two noblemen, friends of the senator, came in, one a few minutes after the other.
I knocked as hard as I could; the door was at last opened, and I made the surgeon follow me in his dressing gown as far as the gondola, which was waiting; he bled the senator while I was tearing my shirt to make the compress and the bandage.
But, although believing fully in my oracles, they were too kind hearted to think them the work of the devil, and it suited their natural goodness better to believe my answers inspired by some heavenly spirit.
He received it with many thanks, and enquired where I lived.
People can likewise eat in the 'magazzino', but they must obtain what they want from the pork butcher near by, who has the exclusive sale of eatables, and likewise keeps his shop open throughout the night.
I certainly did not act towards them with a true sense of honesty, but if the reader to whom I confess myself is acquainted with the world and with the spirit of society, I entreat him to think before judging me, and perhaps I may meet with some indulgence at his hands.
He was celebrated in Venice not only for his eloquence and his great talents as a statesman, but also for the gallantries of his youth.
Three or four months afterwards the chevalier Nicolas Iron, then one of the inquisitors, astonished me greatly by telling me the whole story, giving the names of all the actors.
You possess a real treasure, and you may derive great advantages from it."
I examined him closely, and found him hardly able to breathe.
I grant that my profession was not a brilliant one, but I did not mind it, and, calling prejudices all the feelings which rose in my breast against myself, I was not long in sharing all the habits of my degraded comrades.
There was no cowardly traitor amongst us, although we were all poor; but fear had its effect, and our nocturnal pranks were not renewed.
My brother Francois alone exempted himself from paying the tribute, saying that he was ill, the only excuse which could render his refusal valid, for we had established as a law that every member of our society was bound to do whatever was done by the others.
They were not only good Christians and faithful to the Church, but even real devotees and full of scruples.
"How so?"
He had been very extravagant with women, and more than one of them had committed many follies for him.
He sails all along the canal, gets out of it, takes several turnings, and in a quarter of an hour, we reach Saint George where Balbi lands our prisoners, who are delighted to find themselves at liberty.
I know you and appreciate you.
I understood that he was seized with an apoplectic stroke, and called out to the gondoliers to land me at once, in order to procure a surgeon to bleed the patient.
"Where is my husband?"
In the evening one of the two friends told me that if I had any business to attend to I could go, because they would both pass the night on a mattress near the patient.
The rank of Balbi quieted my anxiety at once, because I knew that, even supposing one of us were vile enough to betray our secret for the sake of the reward, the tribunal would have done nothing in order not to implicate a patrician.
All visitors were sent away by my advice, and the two noblemen and myself were the only persons in the sick man's room.
The incarnation of the Word, they would say, was a trifle for God, and therefore easy to understand, and the resurrection was so comprehensible that it did not appear to them wonderful, because, as God cannot die, Jesus Christ was naturally certain to rise again.
Unwilling to hurt his vanity by telling him that he was mistaken, I took the wild resolution of informing him, in the presence of his two friends, that I possessed a certain numeral calculus which gave answers (also in numbers), to any questions I liked to put.
They did not know who I was, and did not like to ask me; whilst I thought it better to preserve a modest silence.
In taking his handkerchief out of his pocket he let a letter drop on the ground.
God had evidently instructed your guardian angel to bring you to me.
The waiter of the magazzino came to be paid, and our chief gave him what was due, enjoining silence under penalty of death.
The three plaintiffs had not been able to leave the island of Saint George until day break, and the husband, on reaching his house, had found his wife quietly asleep in her bed.
They were not married, and, after having renounced all commerce with women, they had become the enemies of the female sex; perhaps a strong proof of the weakness of their minds.
If the question was so obscure that I could not make out the sense of it, it was natural that I should not understand the answer.
Through the friendship of those three men, I was certain of obtaining consideration and influence in my own country.
Your apartment is ready, you may send your clothes: you shall have a servant, a gondola at your orders, my own table, and ten sequins a month.
"Doctor, the person who has delivered me from your mercury, which was killing me, is a more skilful physician than you;" and, saying these words, he pointed to me.
He did not tell me whether any one of the band had betrayed the secret, and I did not care to know; but I could clearly see the characteristic spirit of the aristocracy, for which the 'solo mihi' is the supreme law.
We took good care to be careful, for if we had been discovered we stood a very fair chance of being sent to practice rowing at the expense of the Council of Ten.
What extraordinary things will sometimes occur from mere chance, or from the force of circumstances!
I must confess that I was very glad of it, and I told my patient that a proper diet was all he needed, and that nature, assisted by the approaching fine season, would do the rest.
They joined together to address a complaint to the Council of Ten.
But a prejudiced mind cannot reason well, and the faculty of reasoning is the most important of all. I often laughed when I heard them talk on religious matters; they would ridicule those whose intellectual faculties were so limited that they could not understand the mysteries of religion.
My readers may imagine whether we felt inclined to laugh when the charming creature bade us good night, thanking us all with perfect good faith!
As for the Eucharist, transubstantiation, the real presence, it was all no mystery to them, but palpable evidence, and yet they were not Jesuits.
A few minutes afterwards he asked me to rub his left arm, which, he said, was so benumbed that he could not feel it.
He had gambled and lost a great deal, and his brother was his most bitter enemy, because he was infatuated with the idea that he had tried to poison him.
"Do not weep, my beauty," says Balbi to her, "we will not hurt you.
Taking everything upon myself, I ordered a servant to hurry out for a physician, who came in a short time, and ordered the patient to be bled again, thus approving the first bleeding prescribed by me.
On the third day, towards the end of the dancing, an hour before day break, feeling tired, I left the orchestra abruptly; and as I was going down the stairs I observed a senator, wearing his red robes, on the point of getting into a gondola.
The said lady having been handsomely entertained by the eight masked men, had been escorted to her house, where she had been politely requested to excuse the joke perpetrated upon her husband.
I felt that in my first profession, as I was not blessed with the vocation necessary to it, I should have succeeded only by dint of hypocrisy, and I should have been despicable in my own estimation, even if I had seen the purple mantle on my shoulders, for the greatest dignities cannot silence a man's own conscience.
Our scandalous proceedings often exposed us to the greatest danger.
There is also another consideration, dear reader, and as I love you I will tell you what it is.
She, doubtless, thinks the offering agreeable, for, when I present myself as the priest appointed to sacrifice a second time to the god of love, she receives me almost with gratitude, and she cannot conceal her joy when she finds out that she is destined to make us all happy.
I saw how easy it must have been for the ancient heathen priests to impose upon ignorant, and therefore credulous mankind.
I told him, and he insisted upon my coming with him in the gondola saying that he would leave me at my house.
"And I, sir," I said, "will remain near his bed in this arm chair, for if I went away the patient would die, and he will live as long as I am near him."
"Not exactly," returned Kaliko.
"In the Metal Forest."
King Kaliko
"Oh, no; I'm quite sure he didn't.
"So I think I will assemble the chief nomes of my kingdom in this throne room and tell them that I am their new King. Then I can ask them to assist us in searching for the secret passages.
"Don't worry," replied Quox.
"I hope he doesn't work too hard," said Shaggy.
"The Ugly One?
"He doesn't work at all.
"Do you suppose Ruggedo destroyed them?"
"Me?" stammered the Chamberlain, greatly surprised by the question. "Well, I couldn't be a worse King, I'm sure."
"However," said Shaggy, "they are gone, that is certain, so we cannot help them or be helped by them.
All the trees are gold and silver and the ground is strewn with precious stones, so it is a sort of treasury."
Kaliko hesitated.
Quox did not have much to say until the conversation was ended, but then he turned to Kaliko and asked:
But is my dear brother well?" he added anxiously.
Next instant Shaggy was himself again and Quox said to him grumblingly:
"That's funny," remarked Betsy thoughtfully.
"Please get off my left toe, Shaggy Man, and be more particular where you step."
They fell into the big pit in the passage, and we put the cover on to keep them there; but when the executioners went to look for them they had all disappeared from the pit and we could find no trace of them."
"Of course not," said he, jumping up from the throne, where he had seated himself.
Betsy laughed and Shaggy seemed rather hurt; but Polychrome relieved his embarrassment by saying softly: "One can be ugly in looks, but lovely in disposition."
"Hooray!" cried Betsy; "I'm glad of that.
They agreed that it did, but no one could explain the mystery.
But to disappear like that seems like magic; now, doesn't it?"
"Where is that?"
Very willingly," replied Kaliko.
"True," agreed Kaliko.
"Of course," said Kaliko.
Portrait painting is a bad pursuit for an emotional artist as it destroys his personality and his sympathy; however, even for the emotional artist there is hope, as a portrait can be converted into a picture 'by adding to the likeness of the sitter some dramatic interest or some picturesque adjunct'!
As for etchings, they are of two kinds-British and foreign.
It is really impossible not to be touched by so charming a description.
We fully admit that it is extremely amusing and, no doubt, mr Quilter is quite earnest in his endeavours to elevate art to the dignity of manual labour, but the extraordinary vulgarity of the style alone will always be sufficient to prevent these Sententiae Artis from being anything more than curiosities of literature. mr Quilter has missed his chance; for he has failed even to make himself the Tupper of Painting.
That there is a difference between colour and colours, that an artist, be he portrait painter or dramatist, always reveals himself in his manner, are ideas that can hardly be said to occur to him; but mr Quilter really does his best and bravely faces every difficulty in modern art, with the exception of mr Whistler.
And then the picture he draws of the ideal home, where everything, though ugly, is hallowed by domestic memories, and where beauty appeals not to the heartless eye but the family affections; 'baby's chair there, and the mother's work basket . . . near the fire, and the ornaments Fred brought home from India on the mantel board'!
A 'JOLLY' ART CRITIC
Painting, he tells us, is 'of a different quality to mathematics,' and finish in art is 'adding more fact'!
mr Quilter is entirely free from affectation of any kind.
Sculpture he regards as 'Painting's poor relation'; so, with the exception of a jaunty allusion to the 'rough modelling' of Tanagra figurines he hardly refers at all to the plastic arts; but on painters he writes with much vigour and joviality.
To many, no doubt, he will seem to be somewhat blatant and bumptious, but we prefer to regard him as being simply British.
Far from it.
On the whole, the book will not do.
After listening so long to the Don Quixote of art, to listen once to Sancho Panza is both salutary and refreshing.
Sententiae: Artis: First Principles of Art for Painters and Picture Lovers.
By Harry Quilter, m a (Isbister.)
He rollicks through art with the recklessness of the tourist and describes its beauties with the enthusiasm of the auctioneer.
There is a healthy bank holiday atmosphere about this book which is extremely pleasant.
About artists and their work mr Quilter has, of course, a great deal to say.
He was unhappily conscious of his total exhaustion.
He could feel with acute sensitivity, hear, and see clearly when he opened his eyes.
"Don't talk like an idiot!"
A red haired mountain of a man, with an apparently inexhaustible store of energy.
"One minute," a voice said, and the time buzzer sounded.
But as soon as the scores began to mount and eliminations cut into their ranks, there was complete silence after dark.
The slap of the button on flesh and the arc of steel that reached out and ended on Irolg's chest over his heart.
The other voice snapped with a harsh urgency, clearly used to command.
That was really all that counted now.
All you need is a touch to win!"
STEPHEN CRANE
At last.
He reacted-but his blade just met air.
"That's all he needs too," Brion grunted, opening his eyes to look at the wiry length of the man at the other end of the long mat.
You're being a fool!"
For my Mother and Father-
This is physically impossible when conscious.
Whoever said you could was making a big mistake and there is going to be trouble-"
"How do we stand?" he asked the handler who was kneading his aching muscles.
This was allowed.
No, not walking, falling.
"Out!" was the single snarled word of the response.
Only his heart and lungs worked on at a strong, measured rate.
Then the powerful twist that thrust it aside.
Working with this as a clue, Brion had developed a self hypnotic technique that allowed him to tap this reservoir of unknown strength-the source of "second wind," the survival strength that made the difference between life and death.
His eyes closed and he was only distantly aware of his handlers catching him as he fell, carrying him to his bench. While they massaged his limp body and cleansed the wound, all of his attention was turned inward.
The force of his rush was so great that the guards on their weapons locked, and their bodies crashed together.
Berserkers and juramentados continue to fight and kill though carved by scores of mortal wounds.
Just thrust and parry, and victory to the stronger.
There was silence then and, still wondering, Brion was once more asleep.
"Ten seconds."
Particularly so on this last night, when only two of the little cubicles were occupied, the thousands of others standing with dark, empty doors.
Of course not.
When the buzzer sounded he pulled his foil from his second's startled grasp, and ran forward.
He had a standing order with off planet agents for archaic chess books, the older the better.
He didn't attempt to attack, just let Brion wear himself out against the firm shield of his defense.
The contestants in the Twenties needed undisturbed rest, therefore nights in the dormitories were as quiet as death.
And when he attacked, it was always there to beat him aside.
The month of continuous mental and physical combat had taken its toll.
It would be hard to stay on his feet, much less summon the strength and skill to fight and win a touch.
If anything, he was pressing the attack.
"Four four.
Except that something was wrong and it was like walking through warm glue.
The nagging memory of the previous night loomed up then, and he turned it over and over in his mind, examining it from all sides.
Walking on his knees.
Thrust-thrust-and each time the parrying sword a little slower to return.
Someone spoke his name.
Brion saw something close to panic on his opponent's face when the man finally recognized his error.
Death seemed an inescapable part of this kind of strength. But there was another type that could easily be brought about in any deep trance-hypnotic rigidity.
He must have drawn his gun, because the intruder said quickly, "Put that away.
With each passing second the power drew at the basic reserves of life, draining it from his body.
Now stand aside!"
Self hypnosis was an accepted tool.
The buzzer's whirr triggered his muscles into complete relaxation.
The words were whispered but clear-two voices, just outside the thin metal of his door.
Brion had carefully conditioned the reflex in himself.
Brion wasn't tiring.
In and under the guard.
Common as the phenomenon seemed to be in the textbooks, it proved impossible to duplicate.
Others had died before during the Twenties, and death during the last round was in some ways easier than defeat.
Every man who entered the Twenties had his own training tricks. Brion had a few individual ones that had helped him so far.
"I'm not to go in there?" says the ex bank clerk, drawing back in dismay from the cloud of foul faces which lowered upon him.
"Hold on to me, Miss Nancy," said the giant, "I'm big enough to carry double."
Kirkland only breathed harder, and looked round for mr North, but mr North had gone.
"Fretted hisself to sleep, yer reverence," said Hailes, in accents of parental concern.
"Oh, mr North!
If he was dying, I can't."
His flogging wouldn't have killed a flea."
mr North!" cried a voice, "for the love of God, let me out of this place!"
CHAPTER thirteen.
"mr North!
I won't have my men knocked up with flogging these rascals.
He had hardly uttered the words, when the boy flung himself beneath the log.
The Commandant, roused from slumber, told mr North that Kirkland might stop where he was, and that he'd thank the chaplain not to wake him up in the middle of the night because a blank prisoner set up a blank howling.
"Oh," he said, "that such a wretch as I should live!"
"It's no good being in the mopes, you know."
"Now then, Miss Nancy," said one of the men, "what's the matter with you!" Kirkland shuddered, and his pale face grew crimson.
"Do him good, curse him!
"A prisoner refractory, your reverence," said the watchman.
Oh, for God's sake, mr North!"
"Your blessed hide'll feel for this, see if it don't."
I'll blank soon cure you of that!" and forthwith ordered him to the chain gang for "insubordination".
"What have you been doing to get into this scrape?"
"You'll see if you won't remember this day."
But Kirkland kept steadily on for the river.
But Kirkland could do nothing but cry,--"Oh, mr North!
Get in." So Kirkland, aged twenty two, and the son of Methodist parents, went in.
"Would you see me perish, body and soul, in this place?
"What's the matter here?" he asked.
North rushed away to the Commandant, and the instant his back was turned, Hailes, the watchman, flung open the door, and darted into the dormitory.
Just as he reached it, however, the figure of mr North rose from behind a pile of stones.
mr North, I'm sorry you should have had the trouble to come here, but will you let me go to sleep?"
"But, mr Troke-"
If you fall, we must fall over you, and then you're done for."
So, doubtless, it was, and might have been, had not an untoward accident occurred.
North returned to the prison disconsolately, found the dutiful Hailes at his post, and all quiet.
"Troke-pick out some likely man, will you?
About dawn the next morning, mr North-who, amongst other vagaries not approved of by his bishop, had a habit of prowling about the prison at unofficial hours-was attracted by a dispute at the door of the dormitory.
"Let him out, watchman!" said North.
"Good evening, sir."
"I order you, sir!" North cried, indignant.
"Wants to come out."
mr North!
Rufus Dawes, among whose sinister memories this yard was numbered, sighed.
"Poor young chap!
Kirkland belonged to a Methodist family and owned a piety utterly out of place in that region.
"Very sorry, your reverence; but your reverence knows that I daren't do such a thing." "mr
"Yes, sir," said Troke.
Kirkland jumped for the jetty, missed his footing, and fell into the arms of the chaplain.
"What do they do if you try to bolt?" whispered Kirkland.
I'll be down in the morning myself if I can."
Kirkland, ghastly pale, bleeding, with his woollen shirt torn, and his blue eyes wide open with terror, was clinging to the bars.
"You young vermin-you shall pay for this," cries Troke.
"What, Kirkland!" cried North, who was ignorant of the vengeance of the Commandant.
"Impertinent young beggar!" said Burgess.
North!" screamed Kirkland.
"What's become of Kirkland?" he asked.
His name was Kirkland, and he belonged to what were known as the "educated" prisoners.
His face was of a greenish tint, and wore an expression of bewildered horror.
"Kill you," returned Dawes, in a tone of surprise at so preposterous a question.
If the scourger won't do his duty, tie him up, and give him five and twenty for himself.
You can guess what that unhappy boy has suffered."
"They won't do it."
"Silence!" cried Troke.
Kirkland was put into a separate cell that night; and Troke, by way of assuring him a good night's rest, told him that he was to have "fifty" in the morning.
Hold up, my lad.
"Can't sir, without an order from the Commandant."
Must stop that.
Oh, mr North!
"I can't.
"Cheer up, man!" said Dawes, touched with momentary pity.
Oh, you ministers of Christ-wolves in sheep's clothing-you shall be judged for this!"
For God's sake, mr North!" and beat on the bars with white and sweating hands.
Troke reported the ex bank clerk that night to Burgess, and Burgess, who was about to go to dinner with the new chaplain, disposed of his case out of hand.
"There's more trouble with you bloody aristocrats than enough.
"Oh, mr North," says Kirkland, "why did you stop me?
The toil was severe, and the companionship uncouth, but despite his blistered hands and aching back, he had not experienced anything so very terrible after all.
"Halt! you young fool," roared Troke, raising his carbine.
"But, my good sir," protested North, restraining his impulse to overstep the bounds of modesty in his language to his superior officer, "you know the character of the men in that ward.
What does he care?"
The work of the gang that afternoon was the carrying of some heavy logs to the water side, and Rufus Dawes observed that Kirkland was exhausted long before the task was accomplished.
"Have you ever been in that-that place I was in last night?" asked Kirkland.
"Thank God!" said Kirkland.
"Stow your gaff," says Troke, with another oath, and impatiently striking the lad with his thong-"I can't argue here all night.
"I suppose so.
Tell Macklewain to be ready-or stay, I'll tell him myself-I'll break the young devil's spirit, blank him."
Fifty lashes, Troke.
That last fellow you had ought to have been tied up himself.
"Tried to bolt, eh!
March!"
"You blank blank, is that your blank game?
"Let him out!" cried North again, stamping his foot.
Rufus Dawes nodded.
So fierce was the glamour of the place, however, that when locked into his cell, he felt ashamed for that sigh, and strove to erase the memory of it.
Lie quiet!"
In the morning, Rufus Dawes, coming to his place on the chain gang, was struck by the altered appearance of Kirkland.
He had been a clerk in a banking house, and was transported for embezzlement, though, by some, grave doubts as to his guilt were entertained.
This, of course, was mere bravado on the part of the Commandant.
Then he began to walk up and down, to fling himself on the sofa, to read, to pray.
"Whom is he going to flog now?"
"Hullo, North! what's the matter?"
"You have not been long in the colony, mr Meekin.
That, at all times debasing, at this particular time it was infamous; that a vice, unworthy of any man, was doubly sinful in a man of education and a minister of God.
"No, no, it will pass.
He saw in the darkness the brandy bottle-vulgar and terrible apparition!
He saved her life, you know."
The dinner went off successfully.
"Abandoned, indeed, by God and man-almost."
"I hope he is," said North.
"Fifty lashes."
"If you please," said Meekin gravely.
Everything must give way to that.
Good night, once more."
He went into his bedroom and flung himself on the bed, but only to toss from side to side.
He has the strangest fits at times.
"Do you know Captain Frere?"
Sleep would not come to him.
He mixed a teaspoonful of this in a pannikin of water and drank it.
"I'll report this to the Government," said North, aghast.
"Look here, mr North, I don't interfere with what you do to the prisoner's souls; don't you interfere with what I do to their bodies."
"I have a headache." His manner of speech and action was so awkward that a silence fell upon the party, caused by each one wondering why mr North should grow confused, and drum his fingers on the table, and stare everywhere but at the decanter.
"You don't mean to say he's going to flog Kirkland?"
He seems to me to be truly penitent for his offences-a misguided, but not a hypocritical man, if my knowledge of human nature goes for anything."
Burgess-desirous, perhaps, of favourably impressing the chaplain whom the Bishop delighted to honour-shut off his blasphemy for a while, and was urbane enough.
"So Captain Frere thinks.
"This is murderous."
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon that bank!
We can't do anything without evidence."
It relieved him for a while.
"mr Meekin-dr
So they went on to the verandah, and looked down upon the lights of the prison, and listened to the sea lapping the shore.
"The Government may go to----, and you, too!" roared Burgess.
I shall find my portmanteau in my room, you said."
Besides, he's not the sort of creature to complain.
Sometimes a party comes over with a recommendation from the Governor, and I show them over the place; but, as a rule, we see no one but ourselves."
There lurked something that fascinated him.
A romantic story, Captain Burgess.
Unless it's a cancer in the stomach, I don't know what it can be."
"Ha!" said North, looking wildly round upon them.
"You'll find us rough, mr Meekin," he said, "but you'll find us 'all there' when we're wanted. This is a little kingdom in itself."
Here attention was called by the strange behaviour of mr North.
"Well, he'll be put into the hospital for a week or so to morrow," said Macklewain, "and that'll give him a spell."
"It has made me heartsick."
In the midst of his arguments he found himself at the cupboard, with the bottle at his lips, in an attitude that was at once ludicrous and horrible.
North knew well that he would never dare to attempt any such act of violence, but the insult stung him like the cut of a whip.
"A great rascal," put in North.
The two men looked at each other, and presently Burgess's eyes fell before those of the chaplain.
"Not at this moment, sir," said Burgess, with dignity.
To see him rolling on the sofa in agony, to see his white face, his parched lips, and his contracted brow, to hear his moans and muttered prayers, one would have thought him suffering from the pangs of some terrible disease.
"I must keep my wits for to morrow.
The taste of the liquor maddened him for more.
"That's Macklewain's business."
Macklewain shook his head seriously.
"I wouldn't trust him."
Meekin, too, will suspect.
I have seen him, and his condition of mind is pitiable."
He had no cancer.
I should say so!" returned Burgess, with a laugh, modelled upon Maurice Frere's own.
"Captain Burgess, Macklewain tells me you are going to flog Kirkland."
He attempted suicide to day-unhappy creature."
Good night.
"Complain!
"Very few.
He raised it to his lips and eagerly drank.
He opened the book again, and forced himself to read, but his eyes wandered to the cupboard.
"Captain Frere takes a deep interest in all relating to convict discipline," went on Meekin, unheeding the interruption, "and is anxious that mrs Frere should see this place."
"You're a dismissed officer of the Government, sir.
"You won't have a nip of brandy before you start?" asked Burgess.
Help me!
"Thank you, none," said North, filling a tumbler with water.
"Yes, it is very complete," he said; "almost too complete.
CHAPTER fourteen.
"Oh, this must be stopped," cried North, in great alarm.
The lad has been cruelly punished already.
"Then, Captain Burgess," cried North, his pale face flushing, "I tell you the boy's blood will be on your head.
The Reverend Meekin was not accustomed to clergymen who wore black neckties, smoked clay pipes, chewed tobacco, and drank neat brandy out of tumblers.
"There were a few matters I noticed in Hobart Town that did not quite please me-the frequent use of profane language for instance-but on the whole I was delighted with the scheme.
"Frere!
"That young butler fellow of his." "What, Kirkland?" cried North.
mr NORTH'S DISPOSITION.
In vain he repeated texts of Scripture and scraps of verse; in vain counted imaginary sheep, or listened to imaginary clock tickings.
"Well now!" said Meekin, with asperity, "I don't agree with you. Everybody seems to be against that poor fellow-Captain Frere tried to make me think that his letters contained a hidden meaning, but I don't believe they did.
"Damn your impertinence, sir!" burst out Burgess.
"He can't stand it.
I struggle, but I am weak.
Meekin-ever softly at his ease-was the first to speak.
"Perhaps you'll have the goodness to allow me to be the best judge of that," returned Macklewain, drawing up his little body to its least insignificant stature.
"Captain Burgess, you have no right to mock at my office."
"A nice example to set.
"He was put into the long dormitory," said North; "you know what sort of a place that is.
North returned home in great agitation.
He's too weak."
The boy's made his bed, and he must lie on it."
"Well, how's Forrest?" cried Burgess.
"That's better."
"I suppose severity is necessary," returned Meekin; "though to my ears a flogging sounds a little distasteful.
I'll teach my prisoners to attempt suicide!"
"Do you persist in having this boy flogged?"
"Macklewain, have a glass of wine." But Macklewain was tired, and wanted to get home.
"I thought it was a little paradise," said Meekin.
"Or like Sancho Panza's island," said North.
It is so complete."
I am a minister of God, sir, and I forbid you to commit this crime."
"No?
The Reverend Meekin eyed his clerical brother with horror.
It was as though he had reached the crisis of a disease which had been for days gathering force. "I must have a teaspoonful," he said, "to allay the craving."
"And let us hope poor mr North will succeed in his labour of love," said Meekin, shutting the little gate, "and save the unfortunate Kirkland.
"Yes, yes.
"They shall not flog that boy," he said.
It is a brutal punishment."
"Pray, don't hurry," said Meekin politely.
I hope you will be comfortable."
"If the boy has anything to complain of, why don't he complain?
"Miss Vickers, a charming young person.
"We've got the fellows here, you know."
"The condition of those dormitories is infamous."
"Cancer in the stomach!
"Good night, sir.
"Well, sir, what of that?" said Burgess.
"My dear sir," replied North, alive to the importance of conciliating the surgeon, "you haven't seen him lately.
Still he could not sleep.
Captain Burgess was shutting his verandah window when North hurried up.
I doubt-forgive me for expressing myself so freely-if you quite know of our convict system."
"I must also be thinking of repose," said Meekin; "the journey-though most enjoyable-has fatigued me."
"Then don't you interfere with me, sir."
"I saw them tried at Hobart Town," said Meekin.
"mr Meekin, here's the gate, and your room is on the right hand.
mr North sighed again.
I'll be back shortly."
mr Meekin expressed some alarm; but dr Macklewain re assured him. "That sort of nonsense must be stopped," said he.
"An admirable one!
Twice he paused on the way to the sitting room, and twice was he driven on by a power stronger than his will.
He saw its amber fluid sparkle. He heard it gurgle as he poured it out.
He got up at length, went into the kitchen, and found a packet of red pepper.
They are going to Sydney, where Captain Frere has some interest, and Frere thinks of taking Port Arthur on his way down."
He made a stride towards the Commandant, as though to seize him by the throat, but, checking himself in time, stood still, with clenched hands, flashing eyes, and beard that bristled.
"It's a punishment for brutes," said Burgess, and laughed, pleased with the nearest approach to an epigram he ever made in his life.
"Pray help yourself to wine."
He reached it at length, and opening the cupboard, pulled out what he sought.
"I was quartered with him at Sarah Island.
"Captain Burgess," protested North, "I assure you that he does not deserve punishment.
"Fool that I am."
"Well, that's just what I'm flogging him for.
I heard something about it, too."
The Reverend mr North, in this cool atmosphere, seemed to recover himself, and conversation progressed with some sprightliness.
"There is something wrong about him, but I can't make out what it is.
No, I say.
Good night."
His staff, you know, mr North.
"I'll go back and see Burgess," said North.
"Confound it-another of my best men," grumbled Burgess.
How delightful the grass smells!
Burgess, white with rage, rang the bell that summoned his convict servant.
He tried to drown himself this morning."
North pursed up his lips.
"Oh! there's no fear of him," said Burgess cheerily; "if he grows uproarious, we'll soon give him a touch of the cat."
"If Burgess flogs him I'll report it to the Governor," cries North, in great heat.
"A spasm.
"Nothing," said North, recovering himself with an effort.
He wept, he prayed, he fought with his desire as with a madness.
"Captain Frere says that the scenery is delightful." "So it is," returned North, looking askance, "but the prisoners are not delightful."
"Oh, God, give me strength!
He is just married, you know."
"The devil he is!
"Up at daylight, I suppose, again."
He'd rather kill himself."
This seems a very pleasant place, and I think I shall enjoy myself very much.
Macklewain, I want to speak with you a moment."
dear me, how dreadful!" says Meekin.
I'll report this to the Government.
"Ah! Doctor, we all have our crosses, have we not?
I can't help it.
I wonder Burgess didn't give him a hundred."
Their vanguard, confined with difficulty for three centuries beyond the Eastern Alps, at the expense of sanguinary wars, had been adopted wherever it was practicable, into the service of the Empire; and the heart's core of the Roman legion was composed of Gothic officers and soldiers.
I can only say that I have laboured honestly and industriously to discover the truth, even in its minutest details, and to sketch the age, its manners and its literature, as I found them altogether artificial, slipshod, effete, resembling far more the times of Louis Quinze than those of Sophocles and Plato.
And the new blood, at the era of this story, was at hand.

PREFACE
But now the main body had arrived.
They brought before the minds of churchmen a thousand new questions which must be solved, unless the Church was to relinquish for ever her claims as the great teacher and satisfier of the human soul.
He dare not tell how evil people were; he will not be believed if he tells how good they were.
By Charles Kingsley
How iniquitous was the conduct of the sons of Theodosius, in refusing the usual bounty, by which the Goths were bribed not to attack the Empire!--The whole pent up deluge burst over the plains of Italy, and the Western Empire became from that day forth a dying idiot, while the new invaders divided Europe among themselves.
So thought many then, and, as I believe, not unwisely.
That very peculiar turn of the Graeco Eastern mind, which made them the great thinkers of the then world, had the effect of drawing them away from practice to speculation; and the races of Egypt and Syria were effeminate, over civilised, exhausted by centuries during which no infusion of fresh blood had come to renew the stock.
For a time had arrived, in which no teacher who did not put forth the most lofty pretensions to righteousness could expect a hearing.
A picture of life in the fifth century must needs contain much which will be painful to any reader, and which the young and innocent will do well to leave altogether unread.
HYPATIA
For somewhat more than four hundred years, the Roman Empire and the Christian Church, born into the world almost at the same moment, had been developing themselves side by side as two great rival powers, in deadly struggle for the possession of the human race.
Monastic isolation from family and national duties especially fitted the fathers of that period for the task, by giving them leisure, if nothing else, to face questions with a lifelong earnestness impossible to the more social and practical Northern mind.
The Egyptian and Syrian Churches, therefore, were destined to labour not for themselves, but for us.
In the present case that disadvantage is doubled; for while the sins of the Church, however heinous, were still such as admit of being expressed in words, the sins of the heathen world, against which she fought, were utterly indescribable; and the Christian apologist is thus compelled, for the sake of decency, to state the Church's case far more weakly than the facts deserve.
This is a LibriVox recording.
And their strength was felt at once.
Here and there an abuse was lopped off; or an edict was passed for the visitation of prisons and for the welfare of prisoners; or a Theodosius was recalled to justice and humanity for a while by the stern rebukes of an Ambrose.
The fifteen years before the time of this tale had decided the fate of Greece; the last four that of Rome itself.
It has to represent a very hideous, though a very great, age; one of those critical and cardinal eras in the history of the human race, in which virtues and vices manifest themselves side by side-even, at times, in the same person-with the most startling openness and power.
And He who excited the craving, was also furnishing that which would satisfy it; and was teaching mankind, by a long and painful education, to distinguish the truth from its innumerable counterfeits, and to find, for the first time in the world's life, a good news not merely for the select few, but for all mankind without respect of rank or race.
How can he, whose sphere lies above the stars, stoop every moment to earth?
The inexpressible must be expressed, the work must be done if it cost me the squaring of the circle.
'Yes.
Strange! that men should be content to grovel, and be men, when they might rise to the rank of gods!
Foolish!--foolish of me, a philosopher.
I quite agree that there are very great practical inconveniences of this kind in the new-I mean the Catholic faith; but the world is full of inconveniences.
If those Christians would but lend me their money, instead of building alms houses and hospitals with it, they might burn the Jews' quarter to morrow, for aught I care.
But while we are in this prison house of matter, we must wear our chain; even wear it gracefully, if we have the good taste; and make the base necessities of this body of shame symbolic of the divine food of the reason.
'Why not?
We shall conquer yet!'
If there is faith in Pythagoras, the symbol should be an expanding series of the powers of three; and yet that accursed binary factor will introduce itself.
For aught I know or care, the plot may be an exactly opposite one, and the Christians intend to murder all the Jews.
'Ah, so they say-Your excellent father has vanished.
On the left of the garden stretched the lofty eastern front of the Museum itself, with its picture galleries, halls of statuary, dining halls, and lecture rooms; one huge wing containing that famous library, founded by the father of Philadelphus, which hold in the time of Seneca, even after the destruction of a great part of it in Caesar's siege, four hundred thousand manuscripts.
'Recollect that you are a Christian,' answered Hypatia, half smiling.
Listen!
But there is my father, pacing up and down in the library.'
Does your excellency, or this proud bishop, govern Alexandria?'
How the finances of the provinces would go on without their kind assistance, I dare not think.
He was a Greek, also, but of a more common, and, perhaps, lower type; dark and fiery, thin and graceful; his delicate figure and cheeks, wasted by meditation, harmonised well with the staid and simple philosophic cloak which he wore as a sign of his profession.
'Well, my dear lady, and has not the villainous demagogue got the whole mob on his side?
'Ah, that your excellency but saw the great duel which depends on you alone!

I will ask the prefect to find out who she is, and get rid of her, before she fascinates me with that evil eye.
However, I got rid of them; quoted all the geographical lies I had ever heard, and a great many more; quickened their appetite for their fool's errand notably, and started them off again.
Did not you work the sum out once, Hypatia?'
But how go on the schools?'
The oracles are dumb.

But I must take some notice of the letter.'
Six new pupils in the mathematical school this morning.
In an age when, as has been well and often said, emperors and consulars crawl to the tombs of a tent maker and a fisherman, and kiss the mouldy bones of the vilest slaves?

'To tell you the truth, he had some forty stout countrymen of his with him, who might have been troublesome to a perplexed prefect; not to mention that it is always as well to keep on good terms with these Goths.
'Ah, Fairest Wisdom, don't mention that horrid word out of the lecture room.
In theory it is all very well; but in poor imperfect earthly practice, a governor must be content with doing very much what comes to hand.

And as for the great brute himself, he has rank enough in his way,--boasts of his descent from some cannibal god or other,--really hardly deigned to speak to a paltry Roman governor, till his faithful and adoring bride interceded for me.
'Consciousness of innocence?
School after school, they had all walked, and taught, and sung there, beneath the spreading planes and chestnuts, figs and palm trees.
Really, after the sack of Rome, and Athens cleaned out like a beehive by wasps, things begin to look serious.
'Let them go.
'That it never will be, as long as Hypatia lives to illuminate the earth; and, as far as I am concerned, I promise you a clear stage and-a great deal of favour; as is proved by my visiting you publicly at this moment, before I have given audience to one of the four hundred bores, great and small, who are waiting in the tribunal to torment me.
'And why should that disturb me?
He paced impatiently up and down the chamber, while his keen, glittering eyes and restless gestures betokened intense inward thought.... 'I have it....
'Well, I will eat, and be ashamed of eating.
Why not, among a people whose God is the crucified son of a carpenter?
I plead guilty myself.
Here is the precious document-do look at it, in pity.
It grows!
What am I to do?'
The statues there are broken.

'And to whom, pray?'

If the gods have deserted their oracles, they have not deserted the souls who aspire to them.
'Why, if anything did happen, after all, conceive the missives which would be sent flying off to Constantinople against me!'
You philosophers, however raised above your own bodies you may be, must really not forget that we poor worldlings have bones to be broken.'
There it towered up, the wonder of the world, its white roof bright against the rainless blue; and beyond it, among the ridges and pediments of noble buildings, a broad glimpse of the bright blue sea.
Well, there will be less loss to the empire if I have to crucify a dozen or two, as I positively will, the next riot.
There is fruit, with lentils and rice, waiting for you in the next room; and bread, unless you despise it too much.'
Thank the gods, there she moves away!
It is really a great comfort to a statesman that the masses are so well aware that they deserve hanging, and therefore so careful to prevent any danger of public justice depopulating the province.
I see her everywhere-till the last month at least-and here she is again!
That is my bitterest grief! to see those who have been pretending in the morning lecture room to worship every word of mine as an oracle, lounging in the afternoon round Pelagia's litter; and then at night-for I know that they do it-the dice, and the wine, and worse.
To show oneself superior to the herd, by seeing boundless depths of living glory in myths which have become dark and dead to them....

But out of the lecture room I prefer a practical expedient for instance, Cyril writes to me here-plague on him! he would not let me even have a week's hunting in peace that there is a plot on the part of the Jews to murder all the Christians.
The place seemed fragrant with all the riches of Greek thought and song, since the days when Ptolemy Philadelphus walked there with Euclid and Theocritus, Callimachus and Lycophron.

Addison's note was a fiction, in which unconnected fragments of his lucubrations were purposely jumbled together, in as odd a manner as he could, in order to produce a laughable effect.
It must, indeed, be allowed, that the structure of his sentences is expanded, and often has somewhat of the inversion of Latin; and that he delighted to express familiar thoughts in philosophical language; being in this the reverse of Socrates, who, it was said, reduced philosophy to the simplicity of common life.

The disposition to derision and insult, is awakened by the softness of foppery, the swell of insolence, the liveliness of levity, or the solemnity of grandeur; by the sprightly trip, the stately stalk, the formal strut, and the lofty mien; by gestures intended to catch the eye, and by looks elaborately formed as evidences of importance.'

It can be accounted for only in this way; that by reading and meditation, and a very close inspection of life, he had accumulated a great fund of miscellaneous knowledge, which, by a peculiar promptitude of mind, was ever ready at his call, and which he had constantly accustomed himself to clothe in the most apt and energetick expression.

"Why have you thrown that away?" asked Boris.
Berg and Boris, having rested after yesterday's march, were sitting, clean and neatly dressed, at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to them, playing chess.
"I say, Berg, my dear fellow," said Rostov, "when you get a letter from home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk everything over with, and I happen to be there, I'll go at once, to be out of your way!
"It's a lackey's job!"
So far everything's all right, but I confess I should much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front."
You know, of course, that His Imperial Highness rode with our regiment all the time, so that we had every comfort and every advantage.
But our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemy's fire!
Still I remained silent.
Boris made a grimace.
After reading a few lines, he glanced angrily at Berg, then, meeting his eyes, hid his face behind the letter.
I am speaking of the staff in general."
Berg, who had obtained his captaincy during the campaign, had gained the confidence of his superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money matters very satisfactorily.
But that's not the point...
Our stories have some weight, not like the stories of those fellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything!"
Both had changed greatly since they last met and both were in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them.
In the middle of his story, just as he was saying: "You cannot imagine what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack," Prince Andrew, whom Boris was expecting, entered the room.
"Go across to our hosts: they invited you," added Boris.
Berg held a smoking pipe between his knees.
"He would drink with you.
"I only sent you the note yesterday by Bolkonski-an adjutant of Kutuzov's, who's a friend of mine.
It was not a matter of life but rather of death, as the saying is.
On the twelfth of November, Kutuzov's active army, in camp before Olmutz, was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two Emperors-the Russian and the Austrian.
He looked intently and inquiringly into his friend's eyes, evidently trying in vain to find the answer to some question.
In spite of Prince Andrew's disagreeable, ironical tone, in spite of the contempt with which Rostov, from his fighting army point of view, regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer was evidently one, Rostov felt confused, blushed, and became silent.
"As for us, Count, we get along on our pay.
What dinners and balls!
At that moment the door opened.
"Eh, is she pretty?" he asked with a wink.
"Well, how are you going to get out of that?" he remarked.
Berg returned, and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three officers became animated.
"Why?"
They spoke of the sayings and doings of their commander, the Grand Duke, and told stories of his kindness and irascibility.
Besides, to tell everything as it really happened, it would have been necessary to make an effort of will to tell only what happened.
I did not think he would get it to you so quickly....
"This letter would be of great use to you."
"I say, send for some wine."
Do go somewhere, anywhere... to the devil!" he exclaimed, and immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking amiably into his face, evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his words, he added, "Don't be hurt, my dear fellow; you know I speak from my heart as to an old acquaintance."
With a pleasant smile Berg related how the Grand Duke had ridden up to him in a violent passion, shouting: "Arnauts!" ("Arnauts" was the Tsarevich's favorite expression when he was in a rage) and called for the company commander.
He wanted to pinch him, push him, do anything but kiss him-a thing everybody did.
Yes, yes!" said Boris, with a smile.
The Guards, just arrived from Russia, spent the night ten miles from Olmutz and next morning were to come straight to the review, reaching the field at Olmutz by ten o'clock.
"Of whom you imagine me to be one?" said Prince Andrew, with a quiet and particularly amiable smile.
"Yes, many stories!
"Why not?" inquired Boris.
They had not met for nearly half a year and, being at the age when young men take their first steps on life's road, each saw immense changes in the other, quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken those first steps.
I can't tell you.
Were you there?"
The next day it was not even mentioned in the Orders of the Day.
"What nonsense!
"As to your business," Prince Andrew continued, addressing Boris, "we will talk of it later" (and he looked round at Rostov).
His hearers expected a story of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement, he had flown like a storm at the square, cut his way in, slashed right and left, how his saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted, and so on.
They had come by easy stages, their knapsacks conveyed on carts, and the Austrian authorities had provided excellent dinners for the officers at every halting place.
"Come to me after the review and we will do what is possible."
Boris rose to meet Rostov, but in doing so did not omit to steady and replace some chessmen that were falling.
He had on a shabby cadet jacket, decorated with a soldier's cross, equally shabby cadet's riding breeches lined with worn leather, and an officer's saber with a sword knot.
I quite understand," said Berg, getting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice.
"Why?"
"I want nothing, and I won't be anyone's adjutant."
"I did not expect you today," he added.
"Oh dear, what a beast I am!" muttered Rostov, as he read the letter.
He ordered his horse at once and, coldly taking leave of Boris, rode home.
He asked him to tell them how and where he got his wound.
I can't."
"Indeed?
"Yes, stories!" repeated Rostov loudly, looking with eyes suddenly grown furious, now at Boris, now at Bolkonski.
"Oh, you damned dandies!
"He is a very, very nice, honest, and pleasant fellow," answered Boris.
Glancing, however, at Boris, he saw that he too seemed ashamed of the hussar of the line.
"Dear me, how you have changed!"
The German landlady, hearing Rostov's loud voice, popped her head in at the door.
Well, how are you?
Been under fire already?" asked Boris.
What receptions we had in Poland!
Clean and fresh as if you'd been to a fete, not like us sinners of the line," cried Rostov, with martial swagger and with baritone notes in his voice, new to Boris, pointing to his own mud bespattered breeches.
The Pavlograds held feast after feast, celebrating awards they had received for the campaign, and made expeditions to Olmutz to visit a certain Caroline the Hungarian, who had recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses.
Berg took the opportunity to ask, with great politeness, whether, as was rumored, the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be doubled.
That's what keeping one's head means.
I can tell you for myself..."
Boris inquired what news there might be on the staff, and what, without indiscretion, one might ask about our plans.
"And Berg too!
However," he added rising, "you know my name and where to find me, but don't forget that I do not regard either myself or you as having been at all insulted, and as a man older than you, my advice is to let the matter drop.
And so he told them all that.
But notwithstanding this, Boris embraced him in a quiet, friendly way and kissed him three times.
The Guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip, parading their cleanliness and discipline.
"Well, as you see.
"And we too have had a splendid march.
Prince Andrew, who liked to help young men, was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed toward Boris, who had managed to please him the day before, he wished to do what the young man wanted.
"Now I'm very glad, very glad indeed, that my brother has distinguished himself so.
It's true that all you women are crybabies," remarked Petya, pacing the room with large, resolute strides.
Petya paced the room in silence for a time.
Sonya became thoughtful.
Him-I just shut my eyes and remember, but Boris...
"Don't come in," she said to the old count who was following her.
I'm not going to."
"What!
"no"
And so it was decided to send the letters and money by the Grand Duke's courier to Boris and Boris was to forward them to Nicholas.
Not a word about himself....
No!" (She shut her eyes.) "No! there's nothing at all."
Not till midwinter was the count at last handed a letter addressed in his son's handwriting.
Her face wore the proud expression of a surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation and admits the public to appreciate his skill.
"If I'd been in Nikolenka's place I would have killed even more of those Frenchmen," he said.
"Shall you write to him?" she asked.
Anna Mikhaylovna, though her circumstances had improved, was still living with the Rostovs.
She felt that Sonya was speaking the truth, that there was such love as Sonya was speaking of.
"Thank God!" said Sonya, crossing herself.
Vera, Natasha, Sonya, and Petya now entered the room, and the reading of the letter began.
You won't?
On retiring to her own room, she sat in an armchair, her eyes fixed on a miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox, while the tears kept coming into her eyes.
"Do you remember him?" Natasha suddenly asked, after a moment's silence.
"I remember Nikolenka too, I remember him well," she said.
Not forgetting anyone.
Anna Mikhaylovna, practical woman that she was, had even managed by favor with army authorities to secure advantageous means of communication for herself and her son.
She rushed to Sonya, hugged her, and began to cry.
"A letter from Nikolenka!
"Hold your tongue, Petya, what a goose you are!"
"Auntie, darling, do tell me what it is!"
"My dear friend?" said she, in a tone of pathetic inquiry, prepared to sympathize in any way.
"And I should be ashamed to write to Boris.
"It's not that I don't remember-I know what he is like, but not as I remember Nikolenka.
When she saw the count, she stretched out her arms to him, embraced his bald head, over which she again looked at the letter and the portrait, and in order to press them again to her lips, she slightly pushed away the bald head.
"Do I remember Nicholas?"
Then I will go and tell at once."
Now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero, would it be right to remind him of herself and, as it might seem, of the obligations to her he had taken on himself?
"Petya, you're a stupid!" said Natasha.
"I don't know.
"No, Sonya, but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly, remember everything?" said Natasha, with an expressive gesture, evidently wishing to give her words a very definite meaning.
Bold as she was, Natasha, who knew how sensitive her mother was to anything relating to Nikolenka, did not venture to ask any questions at dinner, but she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on her chair regardless of her governess' remarks.
Sonya smiled.
I think if he writes, I will write too," she said, blushing.
I don't remember him a bit."
The count sobbed yet more.
"What nasty brutes they are!
"From all he says one should be glad and not cry."
And how he has remembered everybody!
"But I don't remember Boris.
"A little wound, but he has been made an officer; he is well now, he wrote himself," said she through her tears.
But Natasha had not yet felt anything like it.
"Nothing, my dear."
"What a style!
It was long since the Rostovs had news of Nicholas.
The count put his ear to the keyhole and listened.
Natasha smiled through her tears.
Anna Mikhaylovna opened the door.
"I'm not a goose, but they are who cry about trifles," said Petya.
Anna Mikhaylovna, with the letter, came on tiptoe to the countess' door and paused.
"Why should you be ashamed?"
How charmingly he describes!" said she, reading the descriptive part of the letter.
"But perhaps she deceived you.
About some Denisov or other, though he himself, I dare say, is braver than any of them.
"Nicholas!" was all Sonya said, instantly turning white.
"No, dearest, sweet one, honey, I won't give up-I know you know something."
She had opportunities of sending her letters to the Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich, who commanded the Guards.
"And what a soul!
I always said when he was only so high-I always said...."
After dinner, she rushed head long after Anna Mikhaylovna and, dashing at her, flung herself on her neck as soon as she overtook her in the sitting room.
She believed it could be, but did not understand it.
He says nothing about his sufferings.
Let us go to Mamma."
"Well, I don't know.
"No, on my true word of honor," said Natasha, crossing herself, "I won't tell anyone!" and she ran off at once to Sonya.
"Come later." And she went in, closing the door behind her.
Not a word!
Natasha looked at Sonya with wondering and inquisitive eyes, and said nothing.
Her son's growth toward manhood, at each of its stages, had seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed the millions of human beings who grew up in the same way.
In the spring he was taken to Montreal or Quebec for trial, and was honorably acquitted.
Maurice Gerald was not the man-nor Louise Poindexter the woman-to shun such a consummation.
He had no suspicion-not the slightest.
The noose settled over the cutwater of the skiff; and closing around the stem, enabled him to tow the tiny craft to the side on which he stood.
It was a glance of inquiry, ending in a look of chagrin, with some muttered phrases that rendered it more emphatic.
They are but lukewarm lovers who can content themselves with a dialogue carried on at bowshot distance.
Her ready obedience had almost influenced him to regret the prohibition. Walking in confidence by day, and sleeping in security by night, he fancied, it might be recalled.
In an instant after he stood upon the bank; at the convexity of the river's bend, and directly opposite the spot where a skiff was moored, under the sombre shadow of a gigantic cotton tree.
If he be abroad there's a good chance of his seeing me on the open ground; not that I should care a straw, if it were only myself to be compromised.
It is also known that at the same place it traversed a stretch of open prairie, with only a piece of copsewood midway between two extensive tracts of chapparal.
Leaping out, he secured it as it had been before, against the drift of the current; and then, taking stand under the shadow of the cotton tree, he appeared to await either a signal, or the appearance of some one, expected by appointment.
Becoming satisfied that no one was there, he raised the loop end of his lazo-for it was this he carried over his arm-and giving it half a dozen whirls in the air, cast it across the stream.
The sagittary correspondence could not last for long.
He could well concede so much to her caprice: since her staying at home could be no disadvantage to the cause that had prompted him to the stern counsel.
By Saint Patrick, I see no alternative but risk it!
No; I must chance it in the clear light.
Here goes?"
CHAPTER THIRTY ONE.
Saying this, with a swift but stealthy step, the dismounted horseman glided across the treeless tract, and soon readied the escarpment of the cliff, that formed the second height of land rising above the channel of the Leona.
For a short while he stood gazing across the stream, with a glance that told of scrutiny.
It is already known, that this road passed the hacienda of Casa del Corvo, at some distance from the house, and on the opposite side of the river.
"No use waiting for that beauty to go to bed?
Twice had they stood together in that garden grove-twice had they exchanged love vows-under the steel grey light of the stars; and a third interview had been arranged between them.
On reaching the copse he dismounted; led his horse in among the underwood; "hitched" him, by looping his bridle rein around the topmost twigs of an elastic bough; then detaching a long rope of twisted horsehair from the "horn" of his saddle, and inserting his arm into its coil, he glided out to the edge of the "island," on that side that lay towards the hacienda.
Little suspected the proud planter-perhaps prouder of his daughter than anything else he possessed-that she was daily engaged in an act of rebellion-the wildest against which parental authority may pronounce itself.
Its very monstrosity would have disarmed him, had the thought been suggested.
He did not stay ten seconds in this conspicuous situation; but by a path that zigzagged down the bluff-and with which he appeared familiar-he descended to the river "bottom."
Could he have but dreamt it when slumbering upon his soft couch, the dream would have startled him from his sleep like the call of the eternal trumpet!
His own daughter-his only daughter-of the best blood of Southern aristocracy; beautiful, accomplished, everything to secure him a splendid alliance-holding nightly assignation with a horse hunter!
The droll conceit, which has so oft amused the nocturnal inebriate of great cities, appeared to produce a like affect upon the night patroller of the prairie; and for a moment the shadow, late darkening his brow, disappeared.
Hearts brimful of passion must beat and burn together-in close proximity-each feeling the pulsation of the other. "If there be an Elysium on earth, it is this!"
She don't go down for hours; and there's not the sign of a cloud.
A STREAM CLEVERLY CROSSED.
He did not find such as have deserved a place in history.
It was Garcilaso de la Vega, the prince of Spanish poesy, the Spanish Petrarch, according to his fellow countrymen.
Montmorency signed a similar one for Piedmont.
The dauphin, Henry, and his brother Charles, Duke of Orleans, arriving boot and spur from Provence, came up at this moment, shouting likewise, "Hurrah! for the emperor and the king!" "Charles the fifth dropped on his knees," says the narrator, and embraced the two young princes affectionately.
In those days of war and discord, fraught with violence, there was no man who was more personally rough and violent than Montmorency.
He was a man of capacity, who had the gift of resolutely continuing a moderate course of policy, well calculated to gain time, but insufficient for the settlement of great and difficult questions.
Charles put the ring on his finger; and, taking from his neck the collar of the order (the Golden Fleece) he was wearing, he put it upon the king's neck.
For two months Charles the fifth prosecuted this campaign without a fight, marching through the whole of Provence an army which fatigue, shortness of provisions, sickness, and ambuscades were decimating ingloriously.
Queen Eleanor, before long, went and tapped at his door, and sent word to the king that the emperor was awake.
Queen Mary of Hungary, his sister and deputy in the government of the Low Countries, advised a local truce; his other sister, Eleanor, the Queen of France, was of the same opinion; Francis the first adopted it; and the truce in the north was signed for a period of three months.
Francis, with the Cardinal de Lorraine and the Constable de Montmorency, soon arrived.
"Well, brother," said the king, "how do you feel?
Have you rested well?" "Yes," said Charles; "I had made such cheer that I was obliged to sleep it off."
It was Charles the fifth who tackled them.
At last he decided upon retreating.
In fifteen sixty two, at the battle of Dreux, he was aged and so ill that none expected to see him on horseback.
Francis did the converse with his own collar. Only seven of the attendants remained in the emperor's chamber; and there the two sovereigns conversed for an hour, after which they moved to the hall, where a splendid supper awaited them.
Pope Paul the third. (Alexander Farnese), who, on the thirteenth of October, fifteen thirty four, had succeeded Clement the seventh., came forward as mediator.
"Go hang me such a one," he would say, according to Brantome.
On entering the chamber, he found the emperor still lying down and chatting with his sister the queen, who was seated beside him on a chair.
He did accept his disgrace; he retired first to Chantilly, and then to Ecouen; and there he waited for the dauphin, when he became King Henry the second., to recall him to his side and restore to him the power which Francis the first, on his very death bed, had dissuaded his son from giving back.
"You don't see, then," said Clement the seventh's ambassador, "that she brings France three jewels of great price, Genoa, Milan, and Naples?" When this language was reported at the court of Charles the fifth, it caused great irritation there.
Montmorency made up his mind to defend, on the whole coast of Provence, only Marseilles and Arles; he pulled down the ramparts of the other towns, which were left exposed to the enemy.
They all repaired together to the house prepared for their reception, and, after dinner, the emperor, being tired, lay down to rest on a couch.
The ungratefulnesses of kings are sometimes as capricious as their favors.
The tower was taken, and Charles the fifth avenged his poet's death by hanging twenty five of these patriot peasants, being all that survived of the fifty who had maintained the defence.
Angad's Counsel.
Guha And Bharat.
Lakshman's Speech.
Tidings Of Sita.

Sampati's Story.
Rough variety: Very dense and wiry. HEIGHT-Not exceeding sixteen inches.
It is useless to lay down any hard and fast rule as to colour.
But puppies are usually sent out to walk, and may easily be procured to be kept and reared until they are old enough to be entered to their work. Doubtless the rearing of a Harrier puppy is a great responsibility, but it is also a delight to many who feel that they are helping in the advancement of a great national sport.
EARS-Long, set on low, fine in texture, and hanging in a graceful fold close to the cheek.
Either is a good workable size, and such hounds should be able to slip along fast enough for most people.
NOSE-Black, broad, and nostrils well expanded.
Beagle owners, like the masters of Foxhound kennels, have never been very partial to the ordinary dog shows, and so the development of the up-to-date Beagle, as seen at recent shows, is somewhat new.
There is nothing to surpass the beauty of the Beagle either to see him on the flags of his kennel or in unravelling a difficulty on the line of a dodging hare.
Then they seemed to spring from every part of the country.
Dorsetshire used to be the great county for Beagles.
Sixty years ago such hounds were common enough, but possibly through the adoption of the more prevalent plan of beating coverts, and Spaniels being in more general use, the vocation of the Beagle in this particular direction died out, and a big rough coated Beagle is now very rarely seen.
COLOUR-Any recognised hound colour.
STERN-Moderate length, set on high, thick and carried gaily, but not curled over the back.
There was the Cheshire, the Christ Church (Oxford), mr t Johnson's, the Royal Rock, the Thorpe Satchville, the Worcestershire, etc, and of late there have been many more that are as well known as packs of Foxhounds.
Nevertheless, in general appearance the Harrier and the Foxhound are very much alike, the one obvious distinction being that of size.
COAT-Smooth variety: Smooth, very dense and not too fine or short.
It is quite possible, therefore, that the Beagle was crossed with the Welsh, Southern or Otterhound, to get more size and power, as there certainly was a Welsh rough coated Beagle of good eighteen inches, and an almost identical contemporary that was called the Essex Beagle.
Then how quick he is in his casts! and when he is fairly on a line, of course he sticks to it, as the saying is, "like a beagle."
It is so much a matter of individual taste.
Opinions differ as to what standard of height it is advisable to aim at.
NECK-Moderately long, slightly arched, the throat showing some dewlap.
BODY-Short between the couplings, well let down in chest, ribs fairly well sprung and well ribbed up, with powerful and not tucked up loins. HIND QUARTERS-Very muscular about the thighs, stifles and hocks well bent, and hocks well let down.
It is just as it should be, and if more people take up "beagling" it may not be in the least surprising.
As in the case of the Foxhound, the Harrier is very seldom kept as a companion apart from the pack.
If you want to hunt your Harriers on foot, sixteen inches is quite big enough-almost too big to run with; but if you are riding to them, twenty inches is a useful height, or even nineteen inches.
The uses of the Beagle in the early days of the last century, however, were a good deal diversified.
SHOULDERS-Clean and slightly sloping.
The downs there were exactly fitted for them, and years ago, when roe deer were preserved on the large estates, Beagles were used to hunt this small breed of deer.
In eighteen ninety six one became well acquainted with many packs that had apparently held aloof from the dog shows.
DESCRIPTION OF THE BEAGLE: HEAD-Fair length, powerful without being coarse; skull domed, moderately wide, with an indication of peak, stop well defined, muzzle not snipy, and lips well flewed.
FEET-Round, well knuckled up, and strongly padded.
Pocket Beagles must not exceed ten inches.
EYES-Brown, dark hazel or hazel, not deep set nor bulgy, and with a mild expression.
If a stout runner can keep within fairly easy distance of a pack of well bred Beagles on the line of a lively Jack hare, he is in the sort of condition to be generally envied.
In neatness he is really the little model of a Foxhound.
mr Cranes' Beagles were noted at the time, and also those of a Colonel Harding.
For whether things exist, or do not exist, whenever we contemplate their essence, we see that it involves neither existence nor duration; consequently, it cannot be the cause of either the one or the other.
Corollary.--Hence it follows that God is not only the cause of things coming into existence, but also of their continuing in existence, that is, in scholastic phraseology, God is cause of the being of things (essendi rerum).
Wherefore, if the idea of God expressed in the attribute thought, or, indeed, anything else in any attribute of God (for we may take any example, as the proof is of universal application) follows from the necessity of the absolute nature of the said attribute, the said thing must necessarily be infinite, which was our first point.
Whatsoever follows from any attribute of God, in so far as it is modified by a modification, which exists necessarily and as infinite, through the said attribute, must also exist necessarily and as infinite.
But, in so far as it possesses the idea of God, it is supposed finite.
Furthermore, a thing which thus follows from the necessity of the nature of any attribute cannot have a limited duration.
We have now granted, therefore, thought not constituting the idea of God, and, accordingly, the idea of God does not naturally follow from its nature in so far as it is absolute thought (for it is conceived as constituting, and also as not constituting, the idea of God), which is against our hypothesis.
Proof.--Conceive, if it be possible (supposing the proposition to be denied), that something in some attribute of God can follow from the absolute nature of the said attribute, and that at the same time it is finite, and has a conditioned existence or duration; for instance, the idea of God expressed in the attribute thought.
For if it can, suppose a thing, which follows from the necessity of the nature of some attribute, to exist in some attribute of God, for instance, the idea of God expressed in the attribute thought, and let it be supposed at some time not to have existed, or to be about not to exist.
Therefore the idea of God expressed in thought, or anything which necessarily follows from the absolute nature of some attribute of God, cannot have a limited duration, but through the said attribute is eternal, which is our second point. Bear in mind that the same proposition may be affirmed of anything, which in any attribute necessarily follows from God's absolute nature.
This will be made still clearer by the following corollary.
God is the efficient cause not only of the existence of things, but also of their essence.
All things which follow from the absolute nature of any attribute of God must always exist and be infinite, or, in other words, are eternal and infinite through the said attribute.
The essence of things produced by God does not involve existence.
Corollary.--Individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of God, or modes by which the attributes of God are expressed in a fixed and definite manner.
Proof.--The proof of this proposition is similar to that of the preceding one.
Every mode, which exists both necessarily and as infinite, must necessarily follow either from the absolute nature of some attribute of God, or from an attribute modified by a modification which exists necessarily, and as infinite.
For that of which the nature (considered in itself) involves existence is self-caused, and exists by the sole necessity of its own nature.
When the first list was made out, to be submitted to the President, a difficulty was found to exist, which had not occurred either to Colonel Cooper or myself.
He had been appointed neither as a Whig nor as a Democrat, but merely as the fittest candidate for the place in the estimation of the chief of the bureau to which it belonged.
Although warmly attached to mr Pierce personally, and entertaining the highest estimate of his character and political principles, private and personal reasons led me to decline the offer.
I assured the General that this was altogether immaterial, adding that it was "a very pretty quarrel" as it stood, and that I had no desire to effect a settlement of it on any inferior issue.
The officers of these regiments were chosen partly by selection from those already in service in the regular army and partly by appointment from civil life.
Under former administrations of the War Office it had not been customary to make removals or appointments upon political grounds, except in the case of clerkships.
Thenceforward, however, I was but little troubled with any pressure for political appointments in the department.]
This was followed by an invitation to attend the ceremony of his inauguration, which took place on the fourth of March, eighteen fifty three.
The Quartermaster General, on hearing of this conversation, hastened to inform me that it was all a mistake-that the appointee to the office had been confounded with his father, who was a well-known Whig, but that he (the son) was a Democrat.
The Chief Clerk, who had been removed by my predecessor, had peculiar qualifications for the place; and, although known to me only officially, he was restored to the position.
While in Washington, on this visit, I was induced by public considerations to reconsider my determination and accept the office of Secretary of War. The public records of that period will best show how the duties of that office were performed.
To this usage I not only adhered, but extended it to include the clerkships also.
After some further discussion of the question, the visitors withdrew, dissatisfied with the result of the interview.
I further gave them to understand that the same principle of selection would be followed in similar cases, so far as my authority extended.
This, as I am happy to remember, was the only occasion in which the current of my official action, while Secretary of War, was disturbed in any way by sectional or political considerations.
Inquiries were made with regard to gunpowder, which subsequently led to the use of a coarser grain for artillery.
CHAPTER four.
The only discrimination made was in the more prompt and thorough equipment of the parties for the extreme northern line, and this was only because that was supposed to be the most difficult of execution of all the surveys.
Under instructions from the President, the list was therefore revised and modified in accordance with this new element of geographical distribution.
During my administration of the War Department, material changes were made in the models of arms.
"Certainly not," I answered.
The arguments which I had used as a Senator were "the military necessity for such means of transportation, and the need of safe and rapid communication with the Pacific slope, to secure its continuance as a part of the Union."
In the organization and equipment of these parties, and in the selection of their officers, care was taken to provide for securing full and accurate information upon every point involved in the determination of the route.
This was, that the officers selected purely on their military record did not constitute a roster conforming to that distribution among the different States, which, for political considerations, it was thought desirable to observe-that is to say, the number of such officers of Southern birth was found to be disproportionately great.
A day or two afterward, certain Democratic members of Congress called on me and politely inquired whether it was true that I had appointed a Whig to a position in the War Office.
The hoosier had played the mischief with the gravity of the whole party; even the old maid had to put her handkerchief to her face, and the young lady's eyes were filled with tears for half an hour afterward.
"'No,' says the gentleman.
"'Swearin',' says the old preacher, 'is a terrible bad practice, and there ain't no use in it, nohow.
We had a good team,--spanking horses, fine coaches, and one of them drivers you read of.
"'Yours is a great beef country, I believe,' says the old gentleman.
'There's very little grazing here, and the range is pretty much wore out.'
There was myself, and an old gentleman with large spectacles, gold headed cane, and a jolly, soldering iron looking nose; by him was a circus rider, whose breath was enough to breed yaller fever and could be felt just as easy as cotton velvet!
The old preacher listened to him with evident signs of displeasure, twistin' and groanin' till he couldn't stand it no longer.
It's astonishin' to hear what wonderful things he has seen.
"'This ain't no great stock country,' says he to the old gentleman with the cane.
The old gentleman with the cane took a part in the conversation, and the hoosier listened, without ever opening his head.
"'Ah!' says the old gentleman with the cane.
"'Well, sir, it ain't anything else.
A man that's got sense enuff to foller his own cow bell with us ain't in no danger of starvin'.
"We rolled along for some time.
I never enjoyed traveling so well as in the slow coaches.
In the course of his argument he undertook to prove the Scriptures to be true, and told us all about the miracles and prophecies and their fulfilment.
The Bible says, Swear not at all, and I s'pose you know the commandments about swearin'?'
A cross old woman came next, whose look would have given any reasonable man the double breasted blues before breakfast; alongside of her was a rale backwoods preacher, with the biggest and ugliest mouth ever got up since the flood.
I never was better amused in my life.
He was at Sodom and Gomorrow, and seen the place whar Lot's wife fell.'
"'Well, sir,' says 'Indiany,' 'all I've got to say is, if she'd dropped in our parts, the cattle would have licked her up afore sundown!'
"'Right out in the open air?' he asked.
"Then there was nothing said again for some time.
Such a corps, such a time, you never did see.
Well, there was nine 'insiders,' and I don't believe there ever was a stage full of Christians ever started before, so chuck full of music.
I'm gwine down to Orleans to see if I can't git a contract out of Uncle Sam to feed the boys what's been lickin' them infernal Mexicans so bad.
BY DANFORTH MARBLE
"'Is it possible!' says the old gentleman.
"The old gentleman with the cane didn't say nothing, and the preacher gave a long groan.
"'I've just heard of a gentleman,' says the preacher, 'that's been to the Holy Land and went over the Bible country.
The young lady smiled through her veil, and the old lady snapped her eyes and looked sideways at the speaker.
'Indiany,' he stuck his mug out of the window and criticized the cattle we now and then passed.
"I'm sorry," said Dan, as he knocked the ashes from his regalia, as he sat in a small crowd over a glass of sherry, at Florence's, New York, one evening,--"I'm sorry that the stages are disappearing so rapidly.
"'No, sir,' says the old gentleman.
He shut his mouth right in the middle of what he was sayin', and looked at the preacher, while his face got as red as fire.
I was wishing somebody would give the conversation a start, when 'Indiany' made a break.
I've made a good many passages over the Alleghanies, and across Ohio, from Cleveland to Columbus and Cincinnati, all over the South, down East, and up North, in stages, and I generally had a good time.
"'What!' says the hoosier, 'real genewine, good salt?'
"'Don't make much beef here, I reckon,' says the hoosier.
"'Yes, sir; he seen the salt, standin' thar to this day.'
"'Yes, standin' right in the open field, whar she fell.'
"'My friend,' says he, 'you must excuse me, but your conversation would be a great deal more interesting to me-and I'm sure would please the company much better-if you wouldn't swear so terribly.
"When I passed over from Cleveland to Cincinnati, the last time, in a stage, I met a queer crowd.
The scene is wholly enchanting, and such a view from some sheltered sunny corner in a garden which blazes with masses of red and golden flowers tends to feelings of inexpressible satisfaction with all things.
The water gained in spite of every effort.
The large green tent was put up and proper supports made for it.
Through Stormy Seas
The engine room staff and Anderson's people on the engines; scientists were stowing their laboratories; the cook refitting his galley, and so forth-not a single spot but had its band of workers.
Oates and Atkinson with intermittent assistance from others were busy keeping the ponies on their legs.
Even our poor animals will get rest and sleep in spite of the violent motion.
Yesterday he was developing plates with the developing dish in one hand and an ordinary basin in the other!
Meanwhile the huts were erected on the waste ground beyond the harbour works.
I think Priestley is the most seriously incapacitated by sea sickness-others who might be as bad have had some experience of the ship and her movement.
Thank God, the gale is abating.
We are not out of the wood, but hope dawns, as indeed it should for me, when I find myself so wonderfully served.
Bowers attacked the ship's stores, surveyed, relisted, and restowed them, saving very much space by unstowing numerous cases and stowing the contents in the lazarette.
The outlook appeared grim.
Everything was overhauled, sorted, and marked afresh to prevent difficulty in the South.
To use the pump it was necessary to go ahead.
To Town Hall to see Mayor.
Kinsey will act as my agent in Christchurch during my absence; I have given him an ordinary power of attorney, and I think have left him in possession of all facts.
Tales of ponies down came frequently from forward, where Oates and Atkinson laboured through the entire night.
Meares with some helpers had constantly to be rescuing these wretched creatures from hanging, and trying to find them better shelter, an almost hopeless task.
Everything seems to have gone without a hitch.
The seas continually break on the weather bulwarks and scatter clouds of heavy spray over the backs of all who must venture into, the waist of the ship.
Ponting busy with cinematograph.
The first three weeks of November have gone with such a rush that I have neglected my diary and can only patch it up from memory.
On one occasion I was waist deep when standing on the rail of the poop.
We have managed to wedge in all the dog biscuits, the total weight being about five tons; Meares is reluctant to feed the dogs on seal, but I think we ought to do so during the winter.
The ship was over two feet by the stern, but this will soon be remedied.
The stream which was visible and audible inside the stern has been entirely stopped.
All in good spirits except one or two sick.
The seas were continually breaking over these people and now and again they would be completely submerged.
'Occasionally a heavy sea would bear one of them away, and he was only saved by his chain.
Without steam the leak can now be kept under with the hand pump by two daily efforts of a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes.
Meanwhile we have been thinking of a way to get at the suction of the pump: a hole is being made in the engine room bulkhead, the coal between this and the pump shaft will be removed, and a hole made in the shaft.
When the ship came out of dock she presented a scene of great industry.
The bilge pump is dependent on the main engine.
Our meals are simple enough, but it is really remarkable to see the manner in which our two stewards, Hooper and Neald, provide for all requirements, washing up, tidying cabin, and making themselves generally useful in the cheerfullest manner.
There are generally one or two on watch, which eases matters, but it is a squash.
Awoke to much motion.
The sea is still mountainously high, but the ship is not labouring so heavily as she was.
We walked over the hills to Sumner.
We managed to get three tons of ice, one hundred sixty two carcases of mutton, and three carcases of beef, besides some boxes of sweetbreads and kidneys, into this space.
Soon we were plunging heavily and taking much water over the lee rail.
We stayed with the Kinseys at their house 'Te Han' at Clifton.
CHAPTER one
Lashley, to his neck in rushing water, stuck gamely to the work of clearing suctions.
It blew very hard and the sea got up at once.
We are not taking any corn.
From four o'clock last night the wind freshened with great rapidity, and very shortly we were under topsails, jib, and staysail only.
With so much water coming on board, it is impossible to open the hatch over the shaft.
What was to be done?
All these cases are covered with stout tarpaulin and lashed with heavy chain and rope lashings, so that they may be absolutely secure.
Things for the moment appeared very black.
The dates seem unimportant, but throughout the period the officers and men of the ship have been unremittingly busy.
The dogs sit with their tails to this invading water, their coats wet and dripping.
Not a single one has lost his good spirits.
His interest in the expedition is wonderful, and such interest on the part of a thoroughly shrewd business man is an asset of which I have taken full advantage.
We came home in the Harbour Tug; two other tugs followed the ship out and innumerable small boats.
Williams had to confess he was beaten and must draw fires.
At such times they had to cling for dear life to some fixture to prevent themselves being washed overboard, and with coal bags and loose cases washing about, there was every risk of such hold being torn away.'
A great mass of people assembled.
Ship pitching with south westerly swell.
His kindness to us was beyond words.
The extra consists of five tons of hay, five or six tons of oil cake, four or five tons of bran, and some crushed oats.
Anton is suffering badly from sea sickness, but last night he smoked a cigar.
Found all well on board.
Wilson, mrs Evans, and k left at Heads and back in Harbour Tug.
Far away beyond the plains are the mountains, ever changing their aspect, and yet farther in over this northern sweep of sea can be seen in clear weather the beautiful snow capped peaks of the Kaikouras.
If anything more craft following us than at Lyttelton-mrs
Another dog has just been washed overboard-alas!
It is a pathetic attitude, deeply significant of cold and misery; occasionally some poor beast emits a long pathetic whine.
The Voyage Out
Pennell 'swung' the ship for compass adjustment, then 'away.'
Abaft the fore hatch is the ice house.
Williams is working in sweltering heat behind the boiler to get the door made in the bulkhead.
Miller's men were building horse stalls, caulking the decks, resecuring the deckhouses, putting in bolts and various small fittings.
There are four ponies outside the forecastle and to leeward of the fore hatch, and on the whole, perhaps, with shielding tarpaulins, they have a rather better time than their comrades.
A third sledge stands across the break of the poop in the space hitherto occupied by the after winch.
Miller made the excellent job in overcoming this difficulty which I expected, and since the ship has been afloat and loaded the leak is found to be enormously reduced.
Bright sunshine.
Rhodes met us Timaru.
We left Port Chalmers with four hundred sixty two tons of coal on board, rather a greater quantity than I had hoped for, and yet the load mark was three inches above the water.
The sacks containing this last, added to the goods already mentioned, make a really heavy deck cargo, and one is naturally anxious concerning it; but everything that can be done by lashing and securing has been done.
Below one knows all space is packed as tight as human skill can devise-and on deck!
From this moment, about four a m, the engine room became the centre of interest.
The afterguard were organised in two parties by Evans to work buckets; the men were kept steadily going on the choked hand pumps-this seemed all that could be done for the moment, and what a measure to count as the sole safeguard of the ship from sinking, practically an attempt to bale her out!
Meanwhile our good friend Miller attacked the leak and traced it to the stern.
We manage somehow to find a seat for everyone at our cabin table, although the wardroom contains twenty four officers.
'You know how carefully everything had been lashed, but no lashings could have withstood the onslaught of these coal sacks for long'; they acted like battering rams.
We found the false stem split, and in one case a hole bored for a long stem through bolt which was much too large for the bolt.
Wilson joined train.
The Final Preparations in New Zealand
The ship a queer and not altogether cheerful sight under the circumstances.
Within five days she was in dock.
Some four or five tons of fodder and the ever watchful Anton take up the remainder of the forecastle space.
Before the ship left dock, Bowers and Wyatt were at work again in the shed with a party of stevedores, sorting and relisting the shore party stores.
Found all well.
'There was nothing for it but to grapple with the evil, and nearly all hands were labouring for hours in the waist of the ship, heaving coal sacks overboard and re lashing the petrol cases, etc, in the best manner possible under such difficult and dangerous circumstances.
The carcases are stowed in tiers with wooden battens between the tiers-it looks a triumph of orderly stowage, and I have great hope that it will ensure fresh mutton throughout our winter.
Oates has gradually persuaded us that this is insufficient, and our pony food weight has gone up to forty five tons, besides three or four tons for immediate use.
They must perforce be chained up and they are given what shelter is afforded on deck, but their position is not enviable.
We have run one hundred ninety miles to day: a good start, but inconvenient in one respect-we have been making for Campbell Island, but early this morning it became evident that our rapid progress would bring us to the Island in the middle of the night, instead of to morrow, as I had anticipated.
The amount of water which was being made, with the ship so roughly handled, was most uncertain.
Later in the day the wind has veered to the westward, heading us slightly.
And Geraint came to where Arthur was, and saluted him. "Heaven protect thee," said Arthur, "and the welcome of Heaven be unto thee.
Then they set forth towards the court of Arthur.
And that night they went to sleep.
And Arthur gave away the maiden to Geraint.
And the day after the followers of Arthur intended to go away.
And so they came to the palace.
And he greets thee well, as an uncle should greet his nephew, and as a vassal should greet his lord.
And that day and that night were spent in the utmost enjoyment.
And thereupon her fame increased, and her friends became more in number than before.
"I am, lord," said he, "and I have met with much trouble and received wounds unsupportable." Then he told Arthur all his adventure.
And the steward of the household so ordered her.
And the neighboring chiefs, knowing this, grow insolent towards him, and covet his land and possessions.
And unto him he represents that it were better for him to spend the flower of his youth and the prime of his age in preserving his own boundaries, than in tournaments which are productive of no profit, although he obtains glory in them."
Now this is how Arthur hunted the stag.
And they passed that day and that night in the utmost enjoyment.
"It is too soon for you to go away yet," said he; "stay with me until I have finished receiving the homage of my chief men, who have agreed to come to me." And they remained with him until he had done so.
And the head of the stag was given to Enid.
And Kadyriath came to them to know what were their requests.
"Rightly did I judge," said she, "concerning the head of the stag, that it should not be given to any until Geraint's return; and behold, here is a fit occasion for bestowing it.
And they all said that it would be the fulness of joy and honor to them for Geraint to come and receive their homage.
And the next day the ambassadors were permitted to depart, and they were told that Geraint should follow them.
And Guenever was sorry when she saw the condition he was in, even though he was accompanied by the churlish dwarf.
And there was great rejoicing and gladness throughout the whole court, and through all the country, concerning Geraint, because of the greatness of their love to him, and of the greatness of the fame which he had gained since he went from amongst them, and because he was come to take possession of his dominions, and to preserve his boundaries.
"Heaven prosper you!" said Arthur; "and whence do you come?"
And they were not long in giving, so eager was every one to bestow gifts, and of those who came to ask gifts, none departed unsatisfied.
And Arthur told Geraint the cause of the mission, and of the coming of the ambassadors to him out of Cornwall.
--Enid.
And every one asked that which he desired. And the followers of Arthur began to make gifts, and immediately the men of Cornwall came, and gave also.
Miserable and broken is the armor that he wears, and the hue of blood is more conspicuous upon it than its own color." "Knowest thou his name?" said she.
And that day and that night were spent in abundance of feasting.
And from that time she became his wife.
He was the chief physician.
And Geraint went to bear them company, and Enid also, as far as Diganwy; there they parted.
"I know not who they are," said he, "But I know," said Guenever; "this is the knight whom Geraint pursued, and methinks that he comes not here by his own free will.
And in the court they had ample entertainment, and a multitude of gifts, and abundance of liquor, and a sufficiency of service, and a variety of games.
CHAPTER six
And Geraint greets thee well; and in greeting thee he compelled me to come hither to do thy pleasure for the insult which thy maiden received from the dwarf." "Now where did he overtake thee?"
And the last dog that was let loose was the favorite dog of Arthur; Cavall was his name.
And experienced guides, and the chief men of his country, went with him.
"At the place where we were jousting and contending for the sparrow hawk, in the town which is now called Cardiff.
Then Arthur came to them.
One wished that it should be given to the lady best beloved by him, and another to the lady whom he loved best.
And a year, and a second, and a third, he proceeded thus, until his fame had flown over the face of the kingdom.
And they came to the court.
"Lord," said he, "behold, yonder is Guenever, and none with her save only one maiden." "Command Gildas, the son of Caw, and all the scholars of the court," said Arthur, "to attend Guenever to the palace." And they did so.
And the next day Arthur satisfied all the claimants upon Geraint with bountiful gifts.
And he saluted Arthur, and Arthur gazed a long time upon him and was amazed to see him thus.
And at the second turn the stag came toward the hunting party of Arthur.
And Guenever caused a watch to be set upon the ramparts for Geraint's coming.
And after midday they beheld an unshapely little man upon a horse, and after him a dame or a damsel, also on horseback, and after her a knight of large stature, bowed down, and hanging his head low and sorrowfully, and clad in broken and worthless armor.
"Lady," said he, "at the gate there is a knight, and I saw never a man of so pitiful an aspect to look upon as he.
"Right gladly shall it be so," said Arthur.
"Yes," said he, "and it was not to my advantage; and that was not his fault, but mine, lady.
So he received the homage of such as were there.
And thereupon we encountered each other, and he left me, lady, as thou seest." "Sir," said she, "when thinkest thou that Geraint will be here?" "To morrow, lady, I think he will be here with the maiden."
And to do honor to Geraint, all the chief men of the country were invited that night to visit him.
And if he live, he shall do such satisfaction as shall be judged best by the men of the court.
Then they all set forth, holding converse together concerning the head of the stag, to whom it should be given.
But Geraint has overtaken him, and avenged the insult to the maiden to the uttermost." And thereupon, behold, a porter came to the spot where Guenever was.
And Geraint from that time forth loved the hunt, and the tournament, and hard encounters; and he came victorious from them all.
Then Geraint sent ambassadors to the men of Cornwall to ask them this.
And Arthur considered that it would go hard with him to let Geraint depart from him, and from his court; neither did he think it fair that his cousin should be restrained from going to protect his dominions and his boundaries, seeing that his father was unable to do so.
And the maiden took up her abode in the palace, and she had many companions, both men and women, and there was no maiden more esteemed than she in the island of Britain.
"Well," said Arthur, "go and divest yourselves of your accoutrements, and take food, and refresh yourselves after your fatigues; and before you go from hence you shall have an answer." And they went to eat.
And I do not believe that any will begrudge it her, for between her and every one here there exists nothing but love and friendship." Much applauded was this by them all, and by Arthur also.
"will I grant to him, since it is as insulting to thee that an insult should be offered to me as to thyself." "Thus will it be best to do," said Arthur; "let this man have medical care until it be known whether he may live.
The men and the dogs were divided into hunting parties, and the dogs were let loose upon the stag.
"Lady," said he, "Geraint, the son of Erbin, thy best and most valiant servant, greets thee." "Did he meet with thee?" she asked.
And Arthur caused Morgan Tud to be called to him.
And when it was time for them to go to sleep they went.
Said Geraint, "I think I shall have enough of knighthood with me." And they set forth.
Behold, a good earldom, together with myself, will I bestow upon thee; be therefore happy and joyful." "I declare to Heaven," said she, "that henceforth I shall never be joyful while I live." "Come," said he, "and eat." "No, by Heaven, I will not." "But, by Heaven, thou shalt," said he.
And he became acquainted with valiant and mighty men, until he had gained as much fame there as he had formerly done elsewhere.
"Heaven prosper thee!" said Geraint; "and whence dost thou come?"
"Behold then, chieftain, this is most expedient for thee to do to save me from all reproach; come here to morrow and take me away as though I knew nothing thereof." "I will do so," said he.
Then Geraint went to see Erbin.
And thus also he slew the fourth.
And he had a small blue pitcher in his hand, and a bowl on the mouth of the pitcher.
And he did not choose the pleasantest and most frequented road, but that which was the wildest and most beset by thieves and robbers and venomous animals.
Take heed, therefore, unto thy possessions until my return."
"Behold what thou must do," said he; "take the four horses and drive them before thee, and proceed forward as I bade thee just now.
Piercing and loud and thrilling was the cry that Enid uttered.
"I will," said he, "and Heaven reward thee for it."
Then he offered her a goblet of liquor.
Then the third set upon him, and he killed him in like manner.
And Geraint looked upon Enid, and he was grieved for two causes; one was to see that Enid had lost her color and her wonted aspect; and the other, to know that she was in the right.
Meanwhile Geraint followed the giants, and overtook them.
Then they all sat down according to their precedence in honor.
These tidings came to Erbin.
Then all left the board and fled away.
And at the beginning of the night Enid slept a little; and at midnight she arose, and placed all Geraint's armor together so that it might be ready to put on.
And he rode forward.
And although fearful of her errand, she came to the side of Geraint's bed; and she spoke to him softly and gently, saying, "My lord, arise, and clothe thyself, for these were the words of the earl to me and his intention concerning me." So she told Geraint all that had passed.
And as they journeyed thus, they heard an exceeding loud wailing near to them.
And she came and stood over him where he had fallen.
One morning in the summer time they were upon their couch, and Geraint lay upon the edge of it.
And when he reached the place where she was he fell down lifeless from his horse.
"Not I, by my confession unto Heaven," said she; "there is nothing more hateful unto me than this." And she knew not what she should do, for, although it was hard for her to own this to Geraint, yet was it not more easy for her to listen to what she heard, without warning Geraint concerning it.
And they went up out of the river by a lofty steep; and there they met a slender stripling with a satchel about his neck, and they saw that there was something in the satchel, but they knew not what it was.
And there was murmuring and scoffing concerning him among the inhabitants of the palace, on account of his relinquishing so completely their companionship for the love of his wife.
Then he asked of Geraint, "Have I thy permission to go and converse with yonder maiden, for I see that she is apart from thee?" "Thou hast it gladly," said he.
And he desired Enid to mount her horse, and to ride forward, and to keep a long way before him.
So he took her with him to the table against her will, and many times desired her to eat.
"Yonder by the high road," she replied.
But the third turned upon him and struck him with his club so that he split his shield and crushed his shoulder.
I wish but for silence, and not for warning.
When Enid saw this, she cried out, saying, "O chieftain, whoever thou art, what renown wilt thou gain by slaying a dead man?" "O Heaven!" said he, "is it Geraint?" "Yes, in truth," said she; "and who art thou?"
And say not one word unto me, unless I speak first unto thee.
The next morning they went to seek physicians; and it was not long before they came, and they attended Geraint until he was perfectly well.
When he knew that it was thus, he began to love ease and pleasure, for there was no one who was worth his opposing.
"I will do so," said he; "but it is strange to me that thou shouldst go so suddenly.
Sad and sorrowful was the maiden as she saw all this.
"Leave there the candle," said he, "and desire the man of the house to come here." Then she went, and the man of the house came to him.
Thereupon she raised a loud and piercing shriek, and her lamentations were much greater than they had been before; for she considered in her mind, that, had Geraint been alive, he durst not have struck her thus.
"I will prove that I can," said she.
So the earl went to the place where the maiden was, and spake with her.
And having drawn it forth again, he pierced another of them through likewise.
"Stay thou here," said he, "and I will go and see what is the cause of this wailing." "I will," said she.
Then the second horseman attacked him furiously, being wroth at the death of his companion. But with one thrust Geraint overthrew him also, and killed him as he had done the other.
"Ah, lady," said he, "be not so sorrowful for this matter." "It were hard to persuade me to be otherwise," said she.
And they were received there with gladness, and they met with hospitality and attention.
In the evening, behold, the earl came to visit Geraint, and his twelve honorable knights with him.
And after they had eaten and drank, Geraint went to sleep, and so did Enid also.
And at the usual hour they went to sleep.
So he arose and took his leave, and went forth with his attendants.
And there was a river before them, and the horses bent down and drank of the water.
Then he went forward into an open glade that was near the road.
Geraint, as he had been used to do when he was at Arthur's court, frequented tournaments.
Then they washed, and took their repast.
"What sort of meal?" he inquired.
And she lighted a candle, that he might have light to do so.
Then he rushed upon one of them, and thrust his lance through his body.
Then he arose, and said unto her, "Take the horses and ride on, and keep straight on as thou didst yesterday." And they left the wood, and they came to an open country, with meadows on one hand, and mowers mowing the meadows.
So Geraint left him thus and returned to Enid.
"I know nothing, lord," said she, "of thy meaning." "Neither wilt thou know at this time," said he.
"Wilt thou follow my counsel," said the youth, "and take thy meal from me?"
Then he went to sleep in his armor, and thus passed the night, which was not long at that season.
And the two damsels went to the court; and when they arrived there, Geraint was placed upon a little couch in front of the table that was in the hall.
And she was very sorrowful.
So Geraint alighted, and the youth took the maiden from off her horse.
"I will not, by Heaven," said she.
So the maiden went forward, keeping in advance of Geraint, as he had desired her; and it grieved him as much as his wrath would permit, to see a maiden so illustrious as she having so much trouble with the care of the horses.
--Enid.
"Thou hast neither youths nor maidens to serve thee," said he.
Come with me to the court of a son in law of my sister, which is near here, and thou shalt have the best medical assistance in the kingdom."
God be praised that he is well.
I beat about my chamber like a silly bird in a cage.
Write only one word to your own
Until my messenger return I can imagine only evil.
Think of me always.
I dare not now own how foolish I was.
I have not lain down the whole night.
Sweetest love, let me come on to you!
See, they fall upon the page.
If you feel the least unwell, send immediately for advice.
I dared not confess to you before what evils I anticipated.
I almost wish papa would return, though I dread to see him.
I know not what to do.
God bless you, my Ferdinand!
LET us pause.
Your page is inexorable.
He will not let me write another line. God bless you, my Henrietta, my beloved, my matchless Henrietta!
How often I was on the point of sending out the household, and yet I thought it must be useless, and might displease him!
They are images full of distress, and misery, and gloom.
Heaven be with you, and guard over you, and cherish you, and bless you. Think always of me.
Mine own!
Days must elapse before you can reach Bath; and I know, Ferdinand, I know your office is more difficult than you will confess. But come back, my own, as soon as you can, and write to me at the post office, as you settled.
No! you must not come here.
The morning, which broke sweet, and soft, and clear, brought Ferdinand, with its first glimmer, a letter from Henrietta.
O Ferdinand! what has that separation not cost me!
Do not think of moving to day.
Do you know I was so foolish that I thought every flash of lightning must descend on your head.
I feel the desolation of this house, I am so accustomed to see you here!
But I regret it now, because my Henrietta did not sleep.
The storm was magnificent; I would not have missed it for the world.
How I longed to be with you!
My tears are too evident.
Ferdinand.
I know it must be more than a week; I know that that prospect was only held out by your affection.
He is on my pony. He promises to return in a very, very short time.
I knew not what to do.
I do not like to say anything that can annoy you, especially at this moment, when I feel from my own heart how you must require all the support and solace of unbroken fondness.
no pity for them so abounding with love?
If you have the slightest cold, dearest, do not move.
I am quite well, and love you, if that could be, more than ever. Darling, to send to see after her Ferdinand!
Farewell, Ferdinand!
Henrietta.
Postpone that journey on which all our hopes are fixed. Colds bring fever.
It seems to me now that happiness can never come again.
Write to me one line, only one line, to tell me you are well.
I wish to meet him with as much calmness as I can command.
It makes the heart ache but to picture such vicissitudes to the imagination.
Do not keep the messenger an instant.
And yet I ought to be grateful that he was uninjured last night.
If you knew how desolate this house is!
The Emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one of the officers as he went: "Have these gentlemen attended to and taken to my bivouac; let my doctor, Larrey, examine their wounds.
Prince Repnin named Lieutenant Sukhtelen.
"Your regiment fulfilled its duty honorably," said Napoleon.
The stretchers moved on.
Having said this, Napoleon rode on to meet Marshal Lannes, who, hat in hand, rode up smiling to the Emperor to congratulate him on the victory.
There is nothing certain, nothing at all except the unimportance of everything I understand, and the greatness of something incomprehensible but all important."
Either to a Power indefinable, incomprehensible, which I not only cannot address but which I cannot even express in words-the Great All or Nothing " said he to himself, "or to that God who has been sewn into this amulet by Mary!
(The flag had already been taken by the French as a trophy.)
Napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield and, addressing him, again used the epithet "young man" that was connected in his memory with Prince Andrew.
He did not know how long his unconsciousness lasted.
"And who is that young man beside you?"
After looking at him Napoleon smiled.
"Fine men!" remarked Napoleon, looking at a dead Russian grenadier, who, with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape, lay on his stomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide.
Toward morning all these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness of unconciousness and oblivion which in the opinion of Napoleon's doctor, Larrey, was much more likely to end in death than in convalescence.
Bonaparte, having come up at a gallop, stopped his horse.
During this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look about him and even speak.
Prince Andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced, but the little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest outside his uniform.
Prince Andrew remembered nothing more: he lost consciousness from the terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher, the jolting while being moved, and the probing of his wound at the dressing station.
"He is a nervous, bilious subject," said Larrey, "and will not recover."
"How do you feel, mon brave?"
Everything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the stern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood, suffering, and the nearness of death aroused in him.
He heard the speaker addressed as Sire.
It was Napoleon accompanied by two aides de camp.
"That's a fine death!" said Napoleon as he gazed at Bolkonski.
But where am I?"
"Which is the senior?" he asked, on seeing the prisoners.
Suddenly he again felt that he was alive and suffering from a burning, lacerating pain in his head.
"Lift this young man up and carry him to the dressing station."
"Ah!
The quiet home life and peaceful happiness of Bald Hills presented itself to him.
The soldiers who had carried Prince Andrew had noticed and taken the little gold icon Princess Mary had hung round her brother's neck, but seeing the favor the Emperor showed the prisoners, they now hastened to return the holy image.
Not only did they not interest him, but he took no notice of them and at once forgot them.
But he heard the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly.
"Well, and you, young man," said he.
"There are so many prisoners today, nearly the whole Russian army, that he is probably tired of them," said another officer.
He listened and heard the sound of approaching horses, and voices speaking French.
He opened his eyes.
But to whom should I say that?
"Young man, you will go far!"
"I bestow it with pleasure," said Napoleon.
Prince Andrew, who had also been brought forward before the Emperor's eyes to complete the show of prisoners, could not fail to attract his attention.
He feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak, sickly groan which aroused his own pity.
"All the same!
Looking into Napoleon's eyes Prince Andrew thought of the insignificance of greatness, the unimportance of life which no one could understand, and the still greater unimportance of death, the meaning of which no one alive could understand or explain.
So insignificant at that moment seemed to him all the interests that engrossed Napoleon, so mean did his hero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appear, compared to the lofty, equitable, and kindly sky which he had seen and understood, that he could not answer him.
"He's very young to come to meddle with us."
He collected all his strength, to stir and utter a sound.
"Yes, I did not know anything, anything at all till now.
Beside him stood a lad of nineteen, also a wounded officer of the Horse Guards.
Toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still.
His face shone with self satisfaction and pleasure.
"Youth is no hindrance to courage," muttered Sukhtelen in a failing voice.
He did not turn his head and did not see those who, judging by the sound of hoofs and voices, had ridden up and stopped near him.
He knew it was Napoleon-his hero-but at that moment Napoleon seemed to him such a small, insignificant creature compared with what was passing now between himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over it.
At every jolt he again felt unendurable pain; his feverishness increased and he grew delirious.
"Very well.
Why did you not follow him?
"No doubt," growled the Chief.
"You will have to find him, Block, and that speedily, within twenty four hours,--to day, indeed,--or I will break you like a stick, and send you into the gutter.
"The inspector is there," said the guard, pointing to the outer room.
"Monsieur, you shall hear the exact truth.
Of course, such a consummate ass as you have proved yourself would not think of searching the restaurant or the immediate neighbourhood, or of making inquiries as to whether he had been seen, or as to which way he had gone?"
It was a small brass bound note book or diary, and was full of close writing in pencil.
"Forgive me, monsieur, but it is all part of my story.
"Not perfectly, but I can read it.
He was a colleague.
"He was much pressed, in a great hurry.
I suspected nothing when he brought out his pocketbook,--it was stuffed full, monsieur; I saw that and my confidence increased,--called for the reckoning, and paid with an Italian bank note.
It is that, or your great gluttony.
When Block appeared, it was evident that something had gone wrong with him.
Could you?'"
He ate, this devilish Italian, like three, and I too, I was so hungry,--forgive me, sir,--I did my share.
But then, who was to tell he meant to run away?"
how shall I tell you?
"Great Heavens! you should be the fat man in a fair, not an agent of the Detective Bureau."
"Book?
Allow me."
"He was so artful," went on Block in further extenuation of his offence.
"I will charge myself with it, certainly.
"I do not understand, not more than a word here and there.
"It lies with those three, of course-the two women and the Italian.
Why let him out of your sight?"
Directly he crossed the threshold he called the first cab and was driving away, but he was stopped-"
I have been unfortunate, a victim to circumstances, still I believe I know my duty.
His overcoat, stick, this book-his own private memorandum book seemingly-"
"A woman?"
"Tell me," said the Chief, "quick, this woman-what was she like? Did you get her description?"
"Stopped, but only for a moment, and accosted by a woman."
"I did think of it, monsieur, but then, he, the Italian, was just the same as myself.
I was much surprised, but he told me his business often brought him here.
"Alas, monsieur!
"Idiot!
My man should be here by now, and I will instruct him at once.
"And you-greedy, gormandizing beast!--you agreed?"
"What is it?" asked the little Chief, sharply.
"Returned?
We are apt at times to expect others to be intuitively possessed of knowledge that has only come to us at a much later date.
Why did they not keep him, then?"
It is no doubt Italian.
Gone, now, just when we most want him?
You mean arrived."
"Hah! that is greatly against him indeed."
My gentleman made himself most pleasant"
"He left everything behind.
"He has just returned."
"Block?
how?" asked the Chief, gruffly, but obviously much interested.
"The devil!
"He never spoke to the manager, but walked out and let the change go.
Never!"
A minute after, my man got up, saying:
"Get on, get on! come to the essential."
Her face-it was a policeman who saw her, and he said she was good looking, dark, brunette, black hair."
"Impossible!
Of course you have been drinking.
"And what of your duty, your service, pray?"
I have done wrong, I confess.
"No, monsieur, returned.
I have lost him!"
What say you?
He also turned over the pages, pausing to read a passage here and there, and nodding his head from time to time, evidently struck with the importance of the matter recorded.
Explain.
I had no fear of him, not till the very last, when he played me this evil turn.
"Yes, monsieur.
His face wore a look of hot, flurried excitement, and his manner was one of abject, cringing self abasement.
You cannot mean it!
Let us proceed in that way.
"It was all this that helped me to my destruction.
"That should be at once," remarked the Commissary, eager, as usual, for decisive action.
He has gone-disappeared!
"How often must I tell you to get on?"
"It is the maid herself!" cried the little Chief, springing up and slapping his thigh in exuberant glee.
At court there was an endless whispering of lies and calumny, and much plotting and planning among the conspiring courtiers to manipulate the king as the instrument of their own purposes.
Have we not made elaborately permanent the walls of our social compartments?
We have forced living souls into a permanent passivity, making them incapable of moulding circumstance to their own intrinsic design, and of mastering their own destiny.
The same thing is happening now with the people of the West.
Unless we have true faith in freedom, knowing it to be creative, manfully taking all its risks, not only do we lose the right to claim freedom in politics, but we also lack the power to maintain it with all our strength.
They will be incapable of holding a just freedom in politics, and of fighting in freedom's cause.
Its thoughts are fashioned according to the plans of organised interest; in its choosing of ideas and forming of opinions it is hindered either by some punitive force or by the constant insinuation of untruths; it is made to dwell in an artificial world of hypnotic phrases.
Is it merely a transferable commodity?
In the old order the king was given to understand that he was the freest individual in the world.
In fact, the people have become the storehouse of a power that attracts round it a swarm of adventurers who are secretly investing its walls to exploit it for their own devices.
In the age of monarchy the king lived surrounded by a miasma of intrigue.
A greater semblance of external freedom, no doubt, he had than other individuals.
But this power is robbed by hosts of self seekers, and the horse is captured and stabled because of his gift of freedom over space.
In the present age intrigue plays a wider part, and affects the whole country.
The head keeps its place apart from the feet, not through some external arrangement or any conspiracy of coercion.
Have they faith in it?
THE SPIRIT OF FREEDOM
If we have the hardihood to say "yes" to that question, then how can we blame an alien people for subjecting us to a political order which they are tempted to believe eternal?
By squeezing human beings in the grip of an inelastic system and forcibly holding them fixed, we have ignored the laws of life and growth.
Have they acquired a true love of freedom?
It represents the active aspect of inertia which has the appearance of freedom, but not its truth, and therefore gives rise to slavery both within its boundaries and outside.
It hardened into an age of inert construction.
It is the mentality of mutual distrust and fear.
He only has freedom who ideally loves freedom himself and is glad to extend it to others.
(A LETTER FROM NEW YORK TO THE AUTHOR'S OWN COUNTRYMEN)
We boast that, in this world, no other society but our own has come to finality in the classifying of its living members.
But with the ebb of life in India the spirit of creation died away.
We have set up an elaborate ceremonial of cage worship, and plucked all the feathers from the wings of the living spirit of our people.
But have our social divisions the same inevitableness of organic law?
The mob mind is allowed the enjoyment of an apparent liberty, while its true freedom is curtailed on every side.
Forgive! forgive!" and hiding his head under the coverlet, he lay quivering all over.
Now it chanced that the story reached the ears of a certain wandering priest who lodged in the next street.
But how you managed to escape, and are still alive, is more than I can understand."
Thinking I could divine its cause, I came to see you, and am glad to find I was not mistaken.
He would have fled into the house, but the ghost stretched forth its withered arm, and, clutching the back of his neck, scowled at him with a vindictive glare, and a hideous ghastliness of mien, so unspeakably awful that any ordinary man would have swooned with fear.
Repent, therefore, and abandon your evil ways.
"Three years ago, at the Kuana ferry, you flung me into the water; and well you remember it."
When the boatmen and passengers heard the splash, and saw the priest struggling in the water, they were afraid, and made every effort to save him; but the wind was fair, and the boat running swiftly under the bellying sails, so they were soon a few hundred yards off from the drowning man, who sank before the boat could be turned to rescue him.
Here there is an arm of the sea, which is crossed in ferry boats, that start as soon as some twenty or thirty passengers are gathered together; and in one of these boats the two travellers embarked.
Now, alas! by this misfortune, my cousin is dead, and I am left alone."
He spoke so feelingly, and wept so freely, that the passengers believed his story, and pitied and tried to comfort him.
Thus he held forth; and Tokubei, who had long since repented of his crime, implored forgiveness, and gave him a large sum of money, saying, "Half of this is the amount I stole from you three years since; the other half I entreat you to accept as interest, or as a gift."
"He who bears a jewel in his bosom bears poison." Hardly had the Ronin heard these words of the priest than an evil heart arose within him, and he thought to himself, "Man's life, from the womb to the grave, is made up of good and of ill luck.
Be of good cheer, now, and look me in the face, and you will see that I am really a living man, and no vengeful goblin come to torment you."
Haunted by this thought, I lost my nerve, till one night I beheld your spirit, and from that time forth fell ill.
You have done a hateful deed; but am I not a priest, and have I not forsaken the things of this world?
About half-way across, the priest was taken with a sudden necessity to go to the side of the boat; and the Ronin, following him, tripped him up whilst no one was looking, and flung him into the sea.
What think you, gentlemen?" added he, turning to the other travellers.
When he saw this, the Ronin feigned the utmost grief and dismay, and said to his fellow passengers, "This priest, whom we have just lost, was my cousin: he was going to Kiyoto, to visit the shrine of his patron; and as I happened to have business there as well, we settled to travel together.
Seeing he had no ghost to deal with, and overwhelmed by the priest's kindness, Tokubei burst into tears, and answered, "Indeed, indeed, I don't know what to say.
Fortune befriended me ever after; but the richer I grew, the more keenly I felt how wicked I had been, and the more I foresaw that my victim's vengeance would some day overtake me.
and would it not ill become me to bear malice?
"We ought, by rights, to report this matter to the authorities; but as I am pressed for time, and the business might bring trouble on yourselves as well, perhaps we had better hush it up for the present; and I will at once go on to Kiyoto and tell my cousin's patron, besides writing home about it.
What says the proverb?
On my journey homewards, I took a lodging in the next street, and there heard of your marvellous ailment.
Since then, all has gone well with me; yet, had I not been poor, I had never turned assassin nor thief.
"Happily," continued the priest, "I had learned to swim and to dive as a boy; so I reached the shore, and, after wandering through many provinces, succeeded in setting up a bronze figure to Buddha, thus fulfilling the wish of my heart.
To see you do so I should esteem the height of happiness.
But the priest, far from guessing the drift of his comrade's thoughts, journeyed cheerfully on, till they reached the town of Kuana.
In a fit of madness I was tempted to kill and rob you.
They, of course, were only too glad to avoid any hindrance to their onward journey, and all with one voice agreed to what the Ronin had proposed; and so the matter was settled.
To be sure, it seems a shame; yet if I could steal the money this priest is boasting about, I could live at ease for the rest of my days;" and so he began casting about how best he might compass his purpose.
Then the Ronin said to the boatmen-
But neither pill nor potion could cure Tokubei, whose strange frenzy soon became the talk of the whole neighbourhood.
When death enters a house in Japan, there are no undertakers to relieve the family of the painful duty of caring for the dead body and placing it in the coffin.
These religious ceremonies must be attended to by the mother or wife.
Thus the old custom is passing away.
The house owner then decides whether the day set by the builder is a lucky one for himself and his family.
The single exception to this rule about metal is that small copper coins may be put in, to fee the old hag who guards the bank of the river of death.
Visits to noted temples by relatives and friends often result in additions to the child's collection.
On the day after the death, often in the evening, the body must be placed in the cask shaped coffin that until recently was the style commonly in use in Japan.
No foreigner can hope to do more than dabble in the shallows of it.
At an appointed time all the relatives assemble in the death chamber, and preparations are made for the bathing of the corpse.
In the old days, no one thus defiled was allowed to go about his regular business or to mingle with other men; but busy modern Japan does not find it convenient to pause long in its work, so that government officials and school children are now sent written papers excusing them for coming back to their tasks even while ceremonially unclean.
Each child, as it grows toward maturity, gathers from various sources a collection of amulets, which, while worn always when the child is in full dress, are frequently too precious for ordinary play times and the risks and perils of every day life.
In the case of a person of wealth and influence, there will often be a hundred or more of these watchers, who must be fed and cared for; and who take turns in watching, eating, and sleeping.
If it is not, a delay in the building is always preferable to any danger of incurring the displeasure of the luck gods.
There is no official, ceremonial mourning of parents for their children, nor does custom require them to perform any of the last rites, or attend the funeral.
These utensils must have no metal of any kind about them.
To receive these calls the mourners, in full ceremonial dress, must sit in the death chamber and remove for each guest the covering from the face of the dead.
It is their duty to see that the incense burning before the coffin is never allowed to go out, while the food for the dead is renewed at regular intervals by the mourners themselves.
As the children arrive at years of discretion, these treasures pass out of the mother's faithful keeping into the hands of their actual owners, and they are usually kept stored away in some little used drawer or cabinet until death removes the necessity for any further safeguards over life.
Each animal brings its own kind of good or bad luck into the hour, day, or year over which it presides, and only a skillful balancer of pros and cons can read aright the combinations, and understand what the luck of any particular hour in any particular day of any particular year will be.
On the other hand, their bad luck may be counteracted by the good luck of the tiger or hare, for as a rule three animals of different portent are presiding over human prospects every hour.
There are few enlightened Japanese who will defend the present system of cruelty to the afflicted, or who do not long for some change, but so great is the force of conservatism in this regard, so haunting the fear that any change may indicate a lack of respect for the dead, that reform advances slowly.
A fortune teller is consulted for important things, such as removals or marriages, but in every day life one cannot be running to a fortune teller about everything; and yet there is bad luck lurking in the background that may baffle all our plans if we do not observe the proper times and seasons for our undertakings.
But the luck of the rat may be very seriously interfered with by the bad luck of the monkey or of the proverbially unlucky dog, when their days and hours occur in the rat year.
The dress, which must be appropriate to the season, in the making of which all the women of the family must assist, is the plain, straight kimono, but must be folded from right to left, instead of from left to right as in life.
The subject of what to give, when to give, to whom to give, and how to do up the gift acceptably, is one the thorough understanding of which requires the study of years.
The proper offerings are flowers, cake, vegetables, candles, incense, or small gifts of money for the purchase of incense.
Last of all, the vacant spaces in the coffin are filled in with bags of tea.
Through this growing feeling and the unselfishness of maternal affection may come in time the release from these mournful ceremonies.
Just before the procession starts, a religious ceremony is held at the house, which is attended by the friends of the deceased, and which is substantially the same as that performed at the cemetery.
All come who can, and those who cannot come send servants or provisions.
For instance, the rat, which is the companion of Daikoku, the money god, is a lucky animal so far as money is concerned.
Daily offerings must be made before this shrine, and reverence paid by the clapping of hands; while on feast days special offerings and invocations are required.
This somewhat detailed description of the duties to be performed by the members of a bereaved family in the house of mourning is sufficient to show that the presence of death in the home is made as terrible as possible by the painful ceremonies, the continual bustle and excitement, and the strain upon the resources and executive ability of the housekeeper and her assistants.
A person born in the year of the rat will never need money, and will be economical, possibly miserly; and in one born on the day of the rat in the year of the rat these chances and qualities will be doubled.
In his will he provided that his body was to be buried, without washing, in the clothing in which he died.
She it is who sets the rice and wine before the ancestral tablets, who lights the little lamp each night, and who sees that at each feast day and anniversary season the proper food is prepared and set out for the household gods.
The visitors then offer the ceremonial bows to the corpse, as if it were alive.
These little paper packages, each marked with the name of the child to whom it belongs, are kept by the mother.
If the deceased is a person of rank or distinction, the house is flooded with cumbersome and useless offerings.
These must be kept carefully by the mother as a safeguard against the many evils that beset child life.
At the end of this time, some acknowledgment must be sent to every friend who has sent anything to the house at the funeral.
A case in point is that of the late mr Fukuzawa, a man whose life was devoted to the advancement of his countrymen in modern ways, and who in his death continued his teaching.
So far as possible, everything in the old house will be packed and ready the day before, and very early in the morning the relatives and friends of the mover will begin to rally around him.
Another favorite present at this time, among Buddhists, is a cage of living birds, to be borne to the grave and released thereon.
It seems more like a bridal than a burial.
As I have already said, much of a woman's time and thought must be given to the proper distribution of presents among friends and dependents.
We're not waiting for you now.
"Oh, I'm only a little stiff still.
It's all settled, gentlemen.
Don't you see that we're playing a very ticklish game?
"Never to come back again," said Ned sharply.
"And what about you?"
"Nothing, sir, but wait."
"Don't you?
"Did you canter this morning?"
"But the enemy won't be standing still," continued Griggs.
We start to night."
"Let's see; we're going to have another look at the place this afternoon, aren't we?"
But there, I don't want to make speeches.
Finally, just at dusk the animals can be driven in for food and water, and-"
"We've been patient enough."
I should be running fast and dodging in and out among the rocks and trees.
GRIGGS IS STUBBORN.
We've got something else to think about besides teasing and bantering."
"But what about the arrows?" said Ned.
You're always seeing Indians again.
"Any time the doctor likes."
"They seem to me to be hatching up some dodge or another," replied Griggs.
"Serve 'em right if they did, sir.
"Oh yes, I hear.
The Indians have shifted their quarters, and they're in about as awkward a position as they could contrive for our purpose."
"I shouldn't be a bit surprised if we saw them over the way there-just one or two, scouting; and if we do I should be for a stand at arms all night, for it might mean an attack after dark."
"Well, you must talk it over with father," said Chris.
They'd have weeks of work before they could get their horses out but without horses they'd be out in a week.
Every one was busy, for the keeping watch regularly took up a good deal of time.
Were you listening?"
"I don't know about that," said Chris anxiously.
If they do hear anything, we're done."
Serve you right.
A thrill of excitement ran through Chris, and his heart began to beat. Then he was listening, so to speak, with all his might.
"Had a good turn at scouting?"
"And all seems favourable for our attempt to morrow?"
"Yes; of course," said Chris, with a dubious look all the same.
"Why?"
We went at a good swinging gallop."
"It's all nonsense, Ned," cried Chris, "for them to think they are staying on account of us.--Hullo, Griggs!
The plan is to get out of this valley ourselves, where we are regularly locked in, and to put the redskins in our place, locking them in.
"What for?" said Griggs sharply.
Here, I want for us to be off.
Well, I do.
"Yes, sir."
I'm going to take care they don't hit me."
"Canter?
"There, that's enough," cried Chris.
"Oh!
I shall be all right.
"Because it is a very risky thing to do.
"Going to give up young Chris's plan?" said Griggs slowly.
"Not quite, my lads.
"No, sir.
"Because I've seen Indians again."
The days glided by, with the stiffness in Chris Lee's limbs growing less painful, and the pony recovering fast, for the clear mountain air seemed to act like a cure for wounds.
We must get away from here to some good hunting ground.
"Right; I do, neighbour, and it's very handsome of you to offer me the chance to back out.
Griggs nodded his head.
I've just been trying that place again.
"Splendid.
I don't like to bother my father any more, but what does he say?"
"Yes, yes, but you know what I mean."
"Oh, here you are, Griggs," cried the doctor.
"He says we're to start to morrow at daybreak."
"Don't be so petty, Ned.
"Not a bit of it, sir.
How did your pony go this morning?"
"Too many redskins about, as I told you."
Never been away at all, I believe.
"But we shan't, my lad."
"Then what do you propose?"
"Very well; I can do that," said Ned haughtily.
"You mean the shutting up the enemy here to starve?" said Bourne.
You propose offering yourself for a mark to the Indians' arrows, and-"
Just halted a little on the bad leg; but it's better than it was yesterday."
I have felt something of the kind, but I am convinced now that it will not, and that we must chance something and make it."
"I wish we could charge them boldly, and send them flying over the plains."
We shall get strong more quickly journeying over the plains or climbing in and out among the mountains.
"They're an artful lot.
"But all the same we can be making our preparations.
"Hear that, Griggs?"
The Indians can wait; we cannot, and they seem to know it.
It takes a deal to starve a redskin.
CHAPTER FORTY NINE.
Nonsense!
I've no doubt about it now.
"Hurrah!" cried Chris.
Provisions can be packed in our wallets; in fact, everything held ready for a start.
"Not allowed to go off again?"
There's a bit I've been looking out quite a quarter of a mile farther off, and I'm going to propose it to the doctor as being safest."
"There," he said, "I've made up my mind.
"Yes, my lad; but I want them to be planted farther back still.
"Would be if we let them get the better of us, sir."
"Exactly," replied the doctor.
"That's right," cried Griggs.
"Look here; if you say that again we shall quarrel."
"Well, they showed themselves to me; I didn't want them," said Griggs dryly.
"Look here, lads.
"I'm not afraid of them hitting me, my lad," said Griggs confidently. "Being shot at by fellows with bows and arrows sounds bad enough, but there's not much risk here."
"Why not?"
Besides the family there were many servants, and several others walked beside the slow moving wagon.
No, indeed!
The cook, too, went with them.
"When I was young like Shriya, a beggar boy like that would not have dared come so near a noble child." The old woman frowned at the little boy, who crept meekly back to his cart.
Everything was done very leisurely, though there was a lot of talking and disputing and the giving of contrary orders.
"Poor little woman!
"Oh, the thieves!" he cried.
"It is a noble Brahmin boy, and he must be a little prince at the very least," whispered Mahala to Chola in an awestruck voice.
There was quite a procession when at last the big wagon rumbled out through the gateway.
They did not see the little Brahmin again.
No country in the world has so many beggars as India.
"See his rich dresses and the airs he puts on."
This was carried by two men, one in front and one behind, who rested the end of the poles on their shoulders.
First there came a big elephant, all decorated with silk and gold and silver.
The farmer stopped his oxen in the shade,--for oxen also do all the ploughing,--and began to cut some of the long purple stalks of cane.
Soon, when their own pots and pans were got out, and the dishes and the bags of rice and meal, the cook made ready the supper.
As the wagon came up, a young man who accompanied the "Holy Man" ran up and held out a begging bowl, saying: "Give, oh, charitable people, to this Holy One." Chola's mother threw some cakes into the bowl as the wagon stopped.
These rug makers are mostly Mohammedans, a religious sect entirely different from the Hindus.
It is a rare sight now a days to see one of these white cobras."
THE next day everybody in the house began to make preparations for the journey.
"This is more fun than going to school," said Chola, as the oxen plodded along through clouds of dust.
The driver sat on the neck of the elephant and guided the big beast by prodding him on one side or the other with an iron shod stick or goad.
He and Chola were walking beside the wagon for a change.
His long matted hair hung on his shoulders, and he was saying his prayers with the help of a rosary of beads which he continually passed through his hands.
"Maybe he will pray that our babe be made well;" and she sighed as she looked down at the white face of the baby in her arms.
As they were about to move on again, they saw a great cloud of dust down the road.
"Yes, and how he orders every one about him.
The first thing Chola heard when he woke up the next morning was the cook scolding the doves, who were picking out of his meal bags while he was getting breakfast ready.
"Behold! a pure white cobra," cried the farmer.
"Perhaps we can buy some from the man; there he is now ploughing by the stream," said Chola.
"It may be a sign that the babe will be healed," said the mother, hopefully, when the children came back with their sugar cane and told about the wonderful cobra.
"It is an elephant and many men," said one of the servants.
"I take them as an offering to the holy river."
She felt ashamed of herself for ceasing to play hide and seek with Lelechka before Fedosya.
"Why?" asked Fedosya with curiosity.
But, somehow, a sense of fear and of sadness crept into her mood, and it was humiliating to feel that an absurd tale should disturb her beloved fancies, and should agitate her so deeply.
Her mother covered her with a blue blanket. Lelechka drew her sweet little hands from under the blanket and stretched them out to embrace her mother.
seven
They left the nursery together.
Serafima Aleksandrovna was tormented by presentiments.
"It's the truth I'm saying, remember my words," Agathya went on with the same assurance and secrecy.
She eagerly complied with her mother's new wishes.
She'll be up in a minute."
It was a sad day for Serafima Aleksandrovna.
Why does she not get tired of the same thing-of eternally closing her eyes, and of hiding her face?
She did not oppose him.
But it was not these charms in Lelechka that gave her mother the keenest joy.
Lelechka was her mother's only child.
Sergey Modestovich was coming at this moment toward the nursery. Through the half closed doors he heard the laughter, the joyous outcries, the sound of romping.
This charming inability to speak always made, Serafima Aleksandrovna smile with tender rapture.
The mother threw herself after the coffin with despairing sobs, but she was held back.
A smile of absolute bliss played on her red lips.
"Terribly bad!"
"Yes, that's bad," repeated Agathya with conviction.
He was not after her dowry, though it pleased him to know that she had something.
This expression of curiosity gave her face the look of a wooden, roughly painted doll.
Lelechka suddenly glanced toward her mother's corner and screamed with joy.
Serafima Aleksandrovna herself began the game once or twice, though she played it with a heavy heart.
She suffered as though committing an evil deed with full consciousness.
"That the mistress does it, well, that's one thing; but that the young lady does it, that's bad."
Then they began to talk of something else.
He looked handsome and well bred; his intelligent grey eyes always preserved a dignified expression; and he fulfilled his obligations of a fiance with irreproachable gentleness.
She did not wish to hear any further as to the sort of omen it was, and what it foreboded.
She did not know that she was dying.
Fedosya, motionless, with dejected face, sat in a corner, and looked frightened at her mistress; then she suddenly burst out sobbing, and she wailed loudly:
Lelechka was being carried out.
She felt cold with her husband.
Serafima Aleksandrovna drifted farther and farther away from him.
Serafima Aleksandrovna hid her face behind the curtains near Lelechka's bed.
But she soon found that he listened to her without the slightest interest, and only from the habit of politeness.
"Go away," she said quietly.
"Please speak in a sensible way," observed Serafima Aleksandrovna dryly.
"What are you saying?" exclaimed Fedosya, frightened.
Lelechka was asleep, and Serafima Aleksandrovna was sitting in her own room, thinking with joy and tenderness of Lelechka.
"What is it, Fedosya?" she asked with great concern.
"What nonsense!
Is it not a germ of the unconscious non desire to live?"
Her mother went to hide.
Serafima Aleksandrovna tried desperately to amuse Lelechka.
I knew that I'd find you here," he said with a derisive and condescending smile.
With these words she fell asleep, her face pressing the pillow.
"Lelechka is playing.
Even Fedosya felt abashed, now for her mistress, now for herself.
Lelechka was dressed, placed in a little coffin, and carried into the parlour.
One thing Sergey Modestovich had not become reconciled to, and this was his wife's almost continuous presence in the nursery.
When Serafima Aleksandrovna, awakened by Fedosya, came to Lelechka and saw her looking so hot, so restless, and so tormented, she instantly recalled the evil omen, and a hopeless despair took possession of her from the first moments.
She thought to herself: "The mother is like a little child herself-look how excited she is."
The bride was also good looking; she was a tall, dark eyed, dark haired girl, somewhat timid but very tactful.
The Nesletyevs, Sergey Modestovich and Serafima Aleksandrovna, had married without love or calculation, because it was the accepted thing.
Fedosya had a worried, frightened look.
How tragic!
He took his wife by the arm, and cautiously led her away from the coffin.
"You must resign yourself to your fate."
Lelechka was a delightful child.
Then she would look out with a sly glance.
Her mother was growing more absorbed every moment by her interest in the game; her heart beat with short quick strokes, and she pressed even closer to the wall, disarranging her hair still more.
If this is so, is it not a sign of organic weakness?
I don't insist.
"It's the surest sign."
"You see, madam, it's a kind of omen," explained Fedosya abruptly, in a shamefaced way.
She prayed long that night, but the prayer did not relieve her sadness.
"Well?" said Fedosya, the ludicrous expression of curiosity on her face becoming more emphatic.
Lelechka then ran away, stamping with her plump little legs over the carpets, and hid herself behind the curtains near her bed.
Sergey Modestovich went to his wife and, consoling her with cold, empty words, tried to draw her away from the coffin.
He was confused and annoyed.
"I can't tell you how bad it is," said Fedosya, and her face expressed the most decided confidence.
"Why not good?" asked Serafima Aleksandrovna, with vexation, succumbing involuntarily to vague fears.
"Nonsense!" said Serafima Aleksandrovna.
Lelechka was about to fall asleep.
"Where is my baby girl?" the mother asked, as she looked for Lelechka and made believe that she did not see her.
That was why every movement of Lelechka's bewitched her mother.
"Of course I know that gentlefolk don't believe in omens, but it's a bad omen, madam," Fedosya went on in a doleful voice, "the young lady will hide, and hide..."
The nurse, Fedosya, a good-natured and fine looking, if somewhat stupid woman, smiled as she looked at her mistress with her characteristic expression, which seemed to say that it was not for her to object to gentlewomen's caprices.
Fedosya's face made her anxious.
"Who told you all this?" asked Serafima Aleksandrovna in an austere low voice.
She made a special effort that evening to occupy her mind with other matters, but her thoughts returned involuntarily to the fact that Lelechka loved to hide herself.
And Lelechka grew feebler from hour to hour.
A doctor was called, and everything was done that is usual on such occasions-but the inevitable happened.
Her mother looked at her with sad eyes.
No sooner had she climbed into her little bed, protected by a network on all sides, than her eyes began to close from fatigue.
Though she reproached herself at once for this unfounded, superstitious dread, nevertheless she could not enter wholeheartedly into the spirit of Lelechka's favourite game, and she tried to divert Lelechka's attention to something else.
She saw clearly that there could be no possible connexion between a child's quite ordinary diversion and the continuation of the child's life.
HIDE AND SEEK
Nothing made her so unhappy as the reiterations of Fedosya, uttered between sobs: "She hid herself and hid herself, our Lelechka!"
"Lelechka is dead," she said in a quiet, dull voice.
Fever was consuming Lelechka, and there were times when she lost consciousness and spoke in delirium.
"Agathya says so, madam," answered Fedosya; "it's she that knows."
To tell the truth, Serafima Aleksandrovna felt happy only in the nursery.
Serafima Aleksandrovna, upon reflection, attributed these women's beliefs in omens to ignorance.
He liked coming here, where everything was beautifully arranged; this was done by Serafima Aleksandrovna, who wished to surround her little girl, from her very infancy, only with the loveliest things.
The mother's heart seemed to stop-Lelechka lay there so small, so frail, so quiet.
Something rattled in her throat; Lelechka opened and again closed her rapidly paling lips, and died.
Serafima Aleksandrovna tried to console herself with the hope that Lelechka would get well, and would again laugh and play-yet this seemed to her an unthinkable happiness!
The priest and deacon paced up and down the room; clouds of blue smoke drifted in the air, and there was a smell of incense.
eight
Lelechka laughed long and merrily, her head close to her mother's knees, and all of her cuddled up between her mother's white hands.
Her mother's eyes glowed with passionate emotion.
She went into the nursery and began to walk round the room, looking into those places where Lelechka used to hide herself.
Later, however, when his wife was about to have a child, Sergey Modestovich established connexions elsewhere of a light and temporary nature. Serafima Aleksandrovna found this out, and, to her own astonishment, was not particularly hurt; she awaited her infant with a restless anticipation that swallowed every other feeling.
Agathya listened and shook her head ominously; while her face became grave and reproachful.
There was no other such child, there never had been, and there never would be.
He entered in the midst of the lively game, and he confused them all by his radiant coldness.
Sergey Modestovich gave a swift glance round the room.
"In any case, this is but my humble opinion.
Lelechka caught cold.
"I understand nothing of what you are saying."
Serafima Aleksandrovna stood up erect, sighed in a lost way, smiled, and called loudly: "Lelechka!"
Where is my Lelechka?"
"Madam, madam," she said quietly, in a trembling voice.
Three days passed, torturing like a nightmare. Lelechka grew quite feeble.
This might, at the proper opportunity, prove useful.
Sergey Modestovich looked anxiously at her pale face.
He had connexions, and his wife came of good, influential people.
Always irreproachable and tactful, Nesletyev got on in his position not so fast that any one should envy him, nor yet so slow that he should envy any one else-everything came in the proper measure and at the proper time.
He entered the nursery, smiling his genial cold smile; he was irreproachably dressed, and he looked fresh and erect, and he spread round him an atmosphere of cleanliness, freshness and coldness.
She met her husband.
But the thoughts of Serafima Aleksandrovna were confused, and she could not quite grasp what was happening.
Lelechka was getting nearer her mother's corner.
He was always fresh and cool, with a frigid smile, and wherever he passed cold currents seemed to move in the air.
"Sima, my dear, don't agitate yourself," said Sergey Modestovich in a whisper.
When she entered the parlour there were several people between her and Lelechka.
A little girl was born; Serafima Aleksandrovna gave herself up to her. At the beginning she used to tell her husband, with rapture, of all the joyous details of Lekchka's existence.
Serafima Aleksandrovna did not even notice that Fedosya came up to her and paused before her.
"And the mistress herself is like a little one," added Fedosya, smiling.
"What nonsense!
"She'll be up in a minute," persisted Serafima Aleksandrovna, her eyes fixed on the dead little girl.
"It's just as I thought...
The little one did not reply.
Lelechka was quickly carried away from her mother, and those who carried her seemed to run rather than to walk.
"She hid herself, and hid herself, our Lelechka, our angelic little soul!"
Sergey Modestovich hurried the funeral.
Perhaps it was because he himself loved the cold-he loved to drink cold water, and to breathe cold air.
"I'll think it over," his wife answered, smiling, as he did, coldly but genially.
"Lelechka is asleep, may God be with her!
The fever came upon her at night.
She loved her little girl with the ungratified passion that other women, deceived in their husbands, show their chance young lovers.
Her mother stood, with suppressed breathing, her head pressed against the wall, her hair somewhat disarranged.
She seemed so small and so frail under the blanket that covered her.
After their marriage there was nothing in the manner of Sergey Modestovich to suggest anything wrong to his wife.
"This would be a miracle, and miracles do not happen in the nineteenth century."
Fedosya, dejected, her feelings hurt, left her mistress.
Then she put her head out from behind the door, and began to laugh.
Billy blushed.
In the den neither Billy nor Bertram knew or cared what had become of Aunt Hannah and Pete.
"That's what ailed me all the time I was painting that miserable portrait.
Then, suddenly, Bertram stirred.
"Billy, I'm going to marry you to morrow," he announced decisively.
"Your wedding!
The next moment he fell back in amazement before the impetuous rush of a starry eyed, flushed cheeked young woman who demanded:
"Next Tuesday!
It was one matter for her to object to this thing Billy was doing-but quite another for Pete to do it.
"'As soon as,'" he quoted then scornfully.
"Why, Billy," cried the man, in pained surprise.
Well, dearie, I don't know yet what you found, but I do know you wouldn't have found it at all if it hadn't been for Kate-and I wish I had her here this minute!"
"But-"
Something in their smiling faces sent a quick suspicion to her eyes.
"Miss Billy!" gasped the old man.
It was Aunt Hannah's plaintive voice at the doorway, a little later.
I know he is!
Great Scott, Billy, I'll have to trust you five days, after all!
"Well, what is that?
And forthwith he began to tell her how much he did, indeed, need her.
"Well, I suppose I might as well own up now as any time.
"They certainly are."
"Don't want you to get ready," retorted Bertram, promptly.
I'll get-" He stopped short, with a sudden frown.
"But, dearest, what does it mean-you here like this?" asked Bertram then.
"It's next Tuesday, you see."
"I'll warrant she did!
"May I ask why?"
"Yes, a week."
A look that was almost terror came to her eyes. She pulled herself half away from Bertram's encircling arm.
"I saw Marie get ready, and I had all I wanted of it.
Billy giggled hysterically.
But Billy looked him now straight in the face-it was a level, frank gaze of absolute truth.
Across his face swept such a radiant look of unearthly joy that Pete sobbed audibly and fled to the kitchen.
He's in the den.
"Bertram!
"Arkwright?
I'm going to marry you to morrow.
Billy lifted her head.
His face was turned toward the door, but his eyes were closed.
"I see-I hope."
A flying figure brushed by him and fell on its knees by the couch, with a low cry.
Billy, on her knees by the couch, snuggled into the curve of the one arm with a contented little sigh.
"Where is he, Pete?"
There was a long silence; then, a little breathlessly, Billy asked:
Pete told us," she broke off wildly, beginning to sob.
His face was beaming, and his old eyes were shining.
"Bertram, do you-really?"
"Well, I can tell you right now, Billy, you will ruin it if you don't!" declared Bertram.
That was what they were afraid of at first-that I'd lose my arm; but that danger is all past now.
Billy laughed softly.
But that's only a week away," gasped Aunt Hannah.
"Lose me!
"Yes, I know; that is a good while," cut in Bertram, airily.
Billy rose at once as Aunt Hannah entered the room.
"Pete, where is he?" interposed Billy.
Don't you know Kate by this time?"
"Sweetheart, see here, dear," he cried softly, tightening his good left arm.
I was scared blue, Billy, with jealousy of-Arkwright."
As if to make sure that she was "here, like this," he drew her even closer-Bertram was so thankful that he did have one arm that was usable.
You mean it'll be before-October?" Aunt Hannah glanced from one to the other uncertainly.
I wonder if you think I can get ready to be married in five days."
I found it everywhere, afterwards-in magazines and papers, and even in Marie."
"Five days, indeed, sir!
Billy laughed.
Well, no!" exploded Bertram.
This time it was Aunt Hannah who gasped her name.
"Well?" Bertram's voice was a little strained.
Oh, I'm so glad you came!
Dong Ling found him there a minute later polishing a silver teaspoon with a fringed napkin that had been spread over Bertram's tray.
"And you don't-after all, love me-just to paint?"
He had not been slow to mark that swift lowering of her eyelids.
Whatever angels do, young women don't go unannounced and unchaperoned into young men's rooms!
"Well, I am.
"Good heavens!
Bertram kissed the finger and subsided.
Aunt Hannah's cheeks, too, were flushed, and her eyes starry, but with dismay and anger-the last because she did not like the way Pete had said Miss Billy's name.
There was another silence.
"Of course it's she!" retorted Aunt Hannah, testily.
There's a new law about the license.
"Thank God for that," breathed Bertram, as he drew the bright head nearer and held it close.
Nonsense!" she cried.
It'll be all right now-all right!
Then he saw Aunt Hannah-Aunt Hannah with her bonnet askew, her neck bow awry, one hand bare, and the other half covered with a glove wrong side out.
When you were so troubled that the picture didn't go well, and I found out it was about me you were troubled-I-"
I forgot.
"Why, he's going to marry Alice Greggory.
"Aren't lovers the beat'em for imagining things?" she murmured.
"Pete told you that I didn't care for any girl, only to paint?" demanded Bertram, angry and mystified.
"Well, who's doing the marrying-she, or I?" "That's what I said, too-only in another way," sighed Billy.
Opposite the door, on a low couch, lay Bertram, his head bandaged, and his right arm in a sling.
"Do you mean to say you really-"
In the hall above Aunt Hannah was crying into William's gray linen duster that hung on the hall rack-Aunt Hannah's handkerchief was on the floor back at Hillside.
"Billy, my dear!"
I was so worried-for fear I'd lose you."
Billy's eyes widened a little.
"Billy stop!
"mr Bertram is up and dressed, ma'am.
"And you never did think for a minute, Billy, that you cared for him?" Bertram's gaze searched Billy's face a little fearfully.
"mr Bertram," began Pete-but he got no further.
"Confound that law!
I can see it as plain as day in her letters. He's there a lot."
I'll speak to him."
If you really must have all those miles of tablecloths and napkins and doilies and lace rufflings we'll do it afterwards,--not before."
Billy lifted her head and sat back in palpitating dismay.
But, Bertram, what she wrote was true.
With stiffly pompous dignity Pete opened the door.
It was all the others that told me that!
Great Scott, Billy!
Pete had recovered himself by now, but he did not even glance toward Aunt Hannah.
"You see-I wasn't in love with mr Arkwright."
"Miss Billy, Miss Billy, you're an angel straight from heaven, you are-you are!
"As if you yourself didn't bring her here with your crazy messages at this time of night!"
"There, there, dear," comforted Bertram, patting the bronze gold head on his breast.
He's in the den, Miss Billy."
What an absurd idea!"
The tender glow on Billy's face told its own story, and Bertram's eager eyes were not slow to read it.
Billy laughed gayly-but she shifted her position and did not meet her lover's eyes.
The emphatic "we" and "us" were not lost on him. But his face was preternaturally grave when he spoke.
"Well, to begin with, Kate said-"
"Yes, Aunt Hannah, I'll come; besides"--she glanced at Bertram mischievously-"I shall need all the time I've got to prepare for-my wedding."
"We must go home; and William is here, too, and wants to see you."
That was-" Bertram stopped suddenly.
A shamed red crept to the man's forehead.
"Yes," nodded Billy, demurely.
"Well, she wrote a letter."
Pete, once again the punctilious butler, stalked to the door of Bertram's den and threw it wide open.
Bertram's eyes flew open.
Pete's lips twitched.
"Why, Bertram, dear, don't you see?
I'm loads better.
Billy turned eagerly, but before she could take so much as one step toward the door at the end of the hall, Aunt Hannah's indignant voice arrested her.
As for my not painting again-you didn't understand Pete, dearie.
"Tell mr Bertram I am here-or, wait!
"You darling!
Billy put a soft finger on his lips.
Is that Kate, too?" demanded Bertram, grimly.
More than a hundred professing Christian disciples had failed to go to the polls, and many more than that number had voted with the whiskey men.
"Under the circumstances I have a great distaste for what seems like display at such times.
"I feel as you do," replied mr Maxwell.
Only this was with a different attitude.
So that is how it happened that Monday afternoon, at the tent, the funeral service of Loreen was held before an immense audience that choked the tent and overflowed beyond all previous bounds.
Raymond, of course, being a railroad town and the centre of the great packing interests for this region, is full of saloons.
If all the church members of Raymond had voted against the saloon, it would today be outlawed instead of crowned king of the municipality.
The thought that the Christian conscience had been aroused too late or too feebly, lay with a weight of accusation upon the heart of the editor.
I am sure that whatever you and Miss Page think best, will be right."
The rumor at the Rectangle that the second and third wards had gone no license proved to be false.
THE body of Loreen lay in state at the Page mansion on the avenue. It was Sunday morning and the clear sweet spring air, just beginning to breathe over the city the perfume of early blossoms in the woods and fields, swept over the casket from one of the open windows at the end of the grand hall.
For Raymond had awakened that morning to the fact that the city had gone for license after all.
Every one in the Rectangle knew that Loreen was at this moment lying in the Page mansion up on the avenue. Exaggerated reports of the magnificence of the casket had already furnished material for eager gossip.
Would it be public?
"Yes," said Virginia.
The evangelist, a man of apparently very simple, unassuming style, spoke a few words, and he was followed by a fine looking man, the Rev.
But the result was the same as if it had been overwhelming.
The Rectangle was excited to know the details of the funeral.
He heard of the contemplated service at the tent and went down.
It was a meeting full of broken prayers of contrition, of confession, of strong yearning for a new and better city life.
I cannot describe the effect of that singing.
I think the most Christian thing will be to let them have the service at the tent.
john Gray, down in the slum district known as the Rectangle.
That, of course, is not so strange an effect to be produced at a funeral service, but the voice itself was one of thousands.
I do not know but that some time I shall know she gave her life for mine.
The occasion was caused by the killing of a woman during an election riot last Saturday night.
And all through it ran one general cry for deliverance from the saloon and its awful curse.
Let her friends be allowed the gratification of their wishes.
"There was a very unique and unusual funeral service held here this afternoon at the tent of an evangelist, Rev.
"Then followed what was perhaps the queer part of this strange service.
I caught from the minister's remarks that he had only recently changed his views in regard to license.
No man had given or suffered more to influence public opinion that week than Norman.
"The service aside from the singing was peculiar.
What do you think, mr Maxwell?
When had the First Church yielded to such a baptism of tears?
The Rectangle had never before mingled even in this distant personal manner with the aristocracy on the boulevard. The opportunities for doing so were not frequent.
Do you think so, Miss Virginia?"
For her acquaintance was large and many of the recent converts were among her friends.
So the arrangements were made, with some difficulty, for the service at the tent; and Virginia with her uncle and Rollin, accompanied by Maxwell, Rachel and President Marsh, and the quartet from the First Church, went down and witnessed one of the strange things of their lives.
Gray and his wife were besieged by inquirers who wanted to know what Loreen's friends and acquaintances were expected to do in paying their last respects to her.
I will be guided by your judgment in the matter.
The meeting was tender; it glowed with the Spirit's presence; it was alive with strong and lasting resolve to begin a war on the whiskey power in Raymond that would break its reign forever.
Today, the entire force of the gathering seemed to be directed to this one large purpose.
Not a man sang a note.
What did Miss Page intend to do?
A fragment of his account belongs to this part of the history of Raymond:
Henry Maxwell, pastor of the First Church of Raymond.
They had been living so long on their surface feelings that they had almost forgotten the deeper wells of life.
Who could tell what might have been accomplished by this time!
All the time the singing continued softly like rain on a tent cover when the wind is gentle.
We certainly cannot and will not use the occasion for vulgar display.
For that had been the fact in Raymond for years.
"Poor soul!
The saloon ruled.
It was one of the simplest and at the same time one of the most impressive sights I ever witnessed.
Gray had gone up to Virginia's and, after talking it over with her and Maxwell, the arrangement had been made.
He certainly made a very striking address, and yet it was in no sense inappropriate for a funeral.
No one denied that.
She will probably be heard from soon.
But when the congregation had finally gone, and he had entered the lecture room, it needed but a glance to show him that the original company of followers had been largely increased.
But the most remarkable part of the music was a solo sung by a strikingly beautiful young woman, a Miss Winslow who, if I remember right, is the young singer who was sought for by Crandall the manager of National Opera, and who for some reason refused to accept his offer to go on the stage.
The women in the tent, at least a large part of them up near the coffin, began to sing in a soft, tearful way, 'I was a wandering sheep.' Then while the singing was going on, one row of women stood up and walked slowly past the casket, and as they went by, each one placed a flower of some kind upon it.
It was true that the victory was won by a very meager majority.
It seems she had been recently converted during the evangelist's meetings, and was killed while returning from one of the meetings in company with other converts and some of her friends.
And this woman who had been brutally struck down by the very hand that had assisted so eagerly to work her earthly ruin what of her?
Then they sat down and another row filed past, leaving their flowers.
But if the First Church was deeply stirred by the events of the last week, the Rectangle also felt moved strangely in its own way.
What if he had begun to do as Jesus would have done, long ago?
She was a common street drunkard, and yet the services at the tent were as impressive as any I ever witnessed in a metropolitan church over the most distinguished citizen.
And all through his impassioned appeal this morning, there was a note of sadness and rebuke and stern condemnation that made many of the members pale with self accusation or with inward anger.
I understand Miss Winslow sings in the First Church of Raymond and could probably command almost any salary as a public singer.
The Christians of Raymond stood condemned by the result.
The church bells were ringing and people on the avenue going by to service turned curious, inquiring looks up at the great house and then went on, talking of the recent events which had so strangely entered into and made history in the city.
All this, with a voice that rang and trembled and broke in sobs of anguish for the result, did Henry Maxwell pour out upon his people that Sunday morning.
Such a voice could win its way anywhere.
Since the first Sunday when the first company of volunteers had pledged themselves to do as Jesus would do, the different meetings had been characterized by distinct impulses or impressions.
The people at the Rectangle will not come here to service.
What had become of its regular, precise, conventional order of service, undisturbed by any vulgar emotion and unmoved by any foolish excitement?
Raymond had voted to continue for another year the saloon.
"I am and always have been opposed to large public funerals," said Gray, whose complete wholesome simplicity of character was one of its great sources of strength; "but the cry of the poor creatures who knew Loreen is so earnest that I do not know how to refuse this desire to see her and pay her poor body some last little honor.
Over the church, in the silence that followed this strange scene, sobs and the noise of weeping arose.
And men and women wept as he spoke.
She had a most wonderful manner in singing, and everybody was weeping before she had sung a dozen words.
"In the first place, a most exquisite anthem was sung by a trained choir.
mr Maxwell did not ask, this morning, for volunteers to join those who had already pledged to do as Jesus would.
What would Jesus do?
But this seems different.
At the First Church, mr Maxwell, bearing on his face marks of the scene he had been through, confronted an immense congregation, and spoke to it with a passion and a power that came so naturally out of the profound experiences of the day before that his people felt for him something of the old feeling of pride they once had in his dramatic delivery.
"I don't want any dinner," said Charlotte, drawing back.
It's my right, Pickering; you have no father to see to you, and I've always wanted to have the best success be yours." He turned away his head now, a break coming in his voice.
"Sure as I can be, Phronsie," said old mr King, smiling.
There, that's it," patting Charlotte's head with both hands; "now you look very nice; you really do-doesn't she, Polly."
But it was no use, and mr King caught her in time to see the quick drops roll down Phronsie's cheek and to feel them fall on his hand.
"I don't see, Pickering," he resumed, "why you shouldn't get along. You're through college."
"FELICIA a CABOT."
"Good by, dear."
"I've been a lazy dog all my life, and a good for naught; but I hope I've not sunk to that."
"I couldn't," still said Phronsie, and it looked as if the shower were about to fall again.
"But what of that, child, pray?
"For Heaven's sake, Pickering!" cried his uncle, darting in front of the chair and its restless occupant, "don't say that again.
And after this, there were no more quiet days for Charlotte Chatterton. Everybody who was musical, wanted to revel in her voice; and everybody who wasn't, wanted the same thing because it was so talked about.
"I heard it raging up and down."
"But first, child, tell me what it is," and he stroked her yellow hair.
"The very thing!" exclaimed Jasper, with only a thought for Polly's pleasure, when Polly had cried, "How nice of mrs Cabot!" "Don't you say so, father?" he added.
Don't, Grandpapa, don't!" she caught him around the neck imploringly.
Not worth it, either," he added, relapsing into his gloom. Then he shoved his chair so that he could not look his uncle in the face, and bent a steady glance out of the window.
It would be so nice to have Charlotte have some with me."
It really does, Grandpapa."
"Does it make you sorry, Grandpapa dear, to have me want Charlotte to have the money with me?" she asked timidly.
Then she spoke again.
"Come in!" called the old gentleman, "come in!
"I know, child; you think your old Grandpapa does just about right," said mr King soothingly, and highly gratified.
"Oh, I do so wish I might," she said, "there's so much for a little girl like me.
"Indeed you are not, Pickering," cried mr Cabot quickly, the color rising to his cheek.
"I'm not going to lecture you, my boy," said mr Cabot, closing the door, then going to the mantel to lean one elbow on it, a favorite attitude of his, while he scanned his nephew.
"Why, isn't the money my very own, Grandpapa?"
"Bless you, child," cried the old gentleman, much moved, "I wish I could say I believed what you say.
"Wouldn't it make her very glad if I gave Charlotte some of the money?" Phronsie's red lips were very close to his ear now, "oh, I do want to so much; you can't think, Grandpapa, how much!"
Then she sat down on the top step and clasped her hands.
"Now, then, Phronsie, you are never going to be too big, you know, to sit on my knee, so hop up now."
"I won't, Grandpapa," said Phronsie obediently, and patting his broad back with her soft hand.
"Maybe," said the old gentleman, with a short laugh, "and I shouldn't wonder if Cousin Eunice was sorry over a few other things too, Phronsie."
"Assuredly," said old mr King with great satisfaction in Polly's pleasure, and at her success in drawing Charlotte out.
"Grandpapa," asked Phronsie suddenly, "how much money did mrs Chatterton say I was to have?"
"Let me smooth your hair," begged Phronsie, standing on tiptoe; "do bend down just a very little, please.
"If mrs Chatterton was aunt to Charlotte," persisted Phronsie slowly, "it seems as if Charlotte ought to have some of the money.
"Do, dear Polly, run over to morrow morning early.
"Oh, don't!" begged Charlotte, looking over at Polly.
"Dear me, Pickering," taking off his eyeglasses to blow his nose, "you needn't pick me up so violently. I've been much worried about you," settling his glasses again for another look at his nephew.
Two red spots burned on her cheeks, and her pale blue eyes snapped.
"But Cousin Eunice didn't think so, else she'd have left it to Charlotte," said mr King abruptly, "and she did choose to leave it to you.
"Why, what makes you ask such a question?
"Oh, no, Grandpapa," cried Phronsie in a rapture, "I could never be too big for that," so she perched up as of old on his knee, then she folded her hands and looked gravely in his face.
"Well, I won't, child," promised mr King, holding her close.
It ran thus:
Phronsie stood a moment quite still where he left her, then she ran up to him and slipped her hand within his.
So there's an end of it, Phronsie.
But when she saw Polly, she said, "I'm sorry I frightened you, but I'm best alone."
"Oh, nothing, nothing-I'm sure I didn't mean," cried mr Cabot, starting back suddenly in astonishment.
Still no answer.
Polly is looking out for that."
"No, no, child," answered mr King hastily, "and yet I don't know what to say.
"I didn't mean you'd really blame me, only"--
It's the best law firm in the town, Pickering." mr Cabot brought his elbow off from the mantel enough to smite his palms together smartly in enthusiasm.
But many things in my life might have been bettered."
"See here, Pickering," mr Cabot threw wide the door of his private office with a nervous hand.
I didn't want you to have it, but the thing was fixed, and I couldn't help myself.
But come in, come in." He laid hold of Pickering's arm and gently forced him into the little room.
"Grandpapa," said Phronsie, "wasn't mrs Chatterton aunt to Charlotte?"
"Well, what is it, Uncle?
"I got you in there."
I did really, Charlotte."
And I believe I am going to the dogs."
It shall be just a secret between you and me."
"I do believe something is in the room with Charlotte," she said, as Polly came running up the stairs.
And neither can we do anything now, but take matters as they are."
And then he thought no more about it, and the bell ringing and mr Alstyne coming in, he went off into the library for a quiet chat.
"Polly is making her have beautiful times," said Phronsie happily, "oh, very beautiful times indeed, Grandpapa."
"No, no, don't ask me," ejaculated Pickering, striking his knee with one glove, and turning apprehensively in his chair.
"But something worse than common has come to you.
"You are sure you won't make your head ache thinking about it, Grandpapa?" she asked anxiously.
Charlotte flung wide the door.
Do out with it; I'm in no mood for a lecture, though, this morning."
"Well, I can't say but that I was a good deal disturbed at one time," said mr Cabot frankly; "but never mind that now, you are through," and he heaved a sigh of relief, "and nicely established with Van Metre and Cartwright.
There, they are coming after us," as quick footsteps sounded in the hall below. "Hurry, Charlotte, do.
Not to be ungracious, the young man threw himself into a chair.
"I do think," said Phronsie, without taking her eyes from his face, "that maybe mrs Chatterton is sorry now, and wishes that she had left some money to Charlotte.
You may do anything you like, dear. There," mopping up her wet little face with his handkerchief, "now that's a good child; Phronsie, you are not going to cry, of course not. There, do smile a bit; that's my girl now," as a faint light stole into Phronsie's eyes.
"And I can't tolerate any thoughts I cannot speak."
Come in; I never get one nowadays."
"Oh, no, Grandpapa," protested Phronsie in a tone of horror, "they couldn't have been better.
"Indeed, but you must come down," said Polly firmly, holding out her hand.
So she was asked to sing at musicales and receptions without end, until Alexia exclaimed at last, "They are all raving, stark mad over her, and it's all Polly's own fault, the whole of it."
"Oh, bless me!" exclaimed mr King, with a start.
"Blame you?
"Well, then, Phronsie, if you want it, I suppose it must be," said mr King, quite as a matter of course.
"I've seen this thing, whatever it is, coming upon you for sometime," said mr Cabot, too nervous to notice the entreaty in Pickering's voice and manner, "and I cannot wait any longer to find out the trouble.
"So you did, dear," said mr King, highly gratified, and pushing away his writing table, he held out his hand.
"There, there, my sister's boy shall never say that.
"Which is a wonder," interpolated Pickering.
"Oh, hang it, Uncle, why can't you let me alone?"
"Really you must, else I am afraid Grandpapa will be up here after you."
Don't you suppose so, Grandpapa?" and one hand stole up to his neck.
For answer, mr King set her down hastily on the floor, and took two or three turns up and down the room.
"Can't stop, Uncle," said Pickering hastily.
"I was writing a note to mrs Fargo," said Phronsie, putting up her lips for a kiss.
Why, Grandpapa, I couldn't." Phronsie drew a long breath, then threw herself convulsively into his arms, her face working hard in her efforts not to cry.
"I expect she's an awful nuisance," the old gentleman broke out suddenly.
"Yes, Grandpapa," said Phronsie, coming in and shutting the door carefully, "I came on purpose to see you all alone."
Can I help in any way?"
But when he was there, he felt so much worse, that he soon got back into the old position.
What have you got into your head, Phronsie?"
"But, well, now, Phronsie, you run back to your play, child, and I'll set to work at once to think out this matter."
"Oh, Grandpapa!" exclaimed Phronsie, breaking away from him to look into his face.
I don't feel that it would be right for you to give any of your money to her."
I want to consult you in regard to asking Miss Chatterton to sing at my next 'At Home.' I should be charmed to have her favor us.
"Oh, Grandpapa!" exclaimed Phronsie, in gentle reproach, and standing very tall.
"Right?" cried Phronsie, opening her brown eyes very wide.
"Yes, indeed," said Polly cheerily, "just as fine as can be.
What have you been doing lately? Do you gamble?"
"Charlotte poor?" repeated the old gentleman.
It's enough to make a man go to the bad, to lose hope.
Oh, bless me, it's you, Phronsie!" in pleased surprise.
"Yes, yes, of course; but you are too young to judge of such things," said the old gentleman decidedly, "as the giving away of property and all that."
"What do you take me for?" demanded Pickering, starting to his feet with flashing eyes, and throwing open his top coat as if the weight oppressed him.
"Besides, what would be the use, you never see anything encouraging about me or my career.
Oh, she left you everything she had, Phronsie; a couple of millions or so it is; why?"
"Well, my dear, what is it?" asked the old gentleman presently, "you've come to tell me something, I suppose."
"Come, Charlotte."
We're coming, boys," she called.
"Yes; that is, to Charlotte's father," corrected mr King.
"Grandpapa," asked Phronsie, looking intently at him, "isn't Charlotte very, very poor?"
"Come down to dinner, Charlotte," said Polly quickly.
Phronsie laid down the note she was writing to mrs Fargo, a fortnight later, and said to herself, "I would better do it now, I think," and going out, she went deliberately to old mr King's room, and rapped at the door.
"And, meantime," said mr King, quite satisfied, "why, Charlotte is having pretty good times, I think.
"That was I," said Charlotte; "I was the wild beast, Phronsie."
They had just finished dinner, when a note was handed Polly.
William, to the great amazement of the dealer, flung a guinea in the center pot, which was immediately tapped by Jack, while the others looked on in silent expectation.
William frantically said:
Quick as a flash William replied: "I know more than those who know less, and know less than those who know more."
The Devil's Tavern was a resort for actors, authors, bohemians, lords and ladies, who did not retire early to their downy couches.
If he had dropped out of the clouds William could not have been more pleased or surprised, and the feeling was reciprocal.
This was one of the finest homes in the city of that period, and its acquisition was a premonitory sign of the surrender of the famous residential avenue to commerce.
I still sold them for forty cents, and lost more money that year than any other, because the sales were increasing rapidly.
CHAPTER fifteen
Edison marginalized documents extensively.
He was discharged, whereupon the union notified us that unless the boy was taken back the whole body would go out.
The routine was very much the same as that at the laboratory, in its utter neglect of the clock.
For making the dynamos Edison secured, as noted in the preceding chapter, the Roach Iron Works on Goerck Street, New York, and this was also equipped.
This was one of the big 'box houses' on upper Fifth Avenue.
In the second place, the coming of the incandescent light raised the standard of illumination in such a manner that more gas than ever was wanted in order to satisfy the popular demand for brightness and brilliancy both indoors and on the street.
It was not a fact at any time that the public was opposed to the idea of the electric light.
As a matter of fact such work began in advance of almost every other kind.
That made the Tammany man all safe.
The first year, eighteen eighty one, was naturally that which witnessed the greatest rush of visitors; and the building hardly ever closed its doors till midnight.
I would talk for the benefit of his music.
The houses afterward went onto the New York Edison system."
I had caused a printer's composing case to be set up with the idea that if we could get editors and publishers in to see it, we should show them the advantages of the electric light.
I had nothing on to protect me against the cold.
So much for the early opposition, of which there was plenty.
Twombly closed the contract with us for a plant.
Even if I locked them up in my desk they would break it open.
I did whatever he told me, and looked after all kinds of affairs, from buying his clothes to financing his business.
I remember as a coincidence that the building was only twenty feet wide.
We moved the lamp works from Menlo Park to Harrison.
Speaking of telling stories, I once got telling a man stories at the Harrison lamp factory, in the yard, as he was leaving.
The way of the inventor is hard.
The important question had arisen, therefore, of satisfying the fire underwriters as to the safety of the system.
The other man could not, and so we let him out.
After that, every time he came to New York he used to call at 'sixty five' late at night with his violin.
I was too busy on other things to notice."
The process is heroic but costly.
mr Herter was doing the decoration, and it was extraordinarily fine.
In two distinct directions the gas art was immediately helped by Edison's work.
I thought no more about the matter.
They were not only more surly; they were diminishing the output, and it became impossible to manage the works.
He was good company.
INTRODUCTION OF THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT
There also the most bitter feeling was shown.
He gave us permission-told us to go ahead, and he would see it was all right.
After feeling around for some days I got a clew how to do it.
We sold them for forty cents; but there were only about twenty or thirty thousand of them.
Finally I opened the pedestal-a storehouse for tools, etc
'No! not doubts as to religion; not the slightest injury to that.' He paused.
'No,' said Margaret, sadly, 'I will do it.
'Frederick must not suffer,' said Margaret, decidedly; 'in a foreign country; so unjustly treated by his own.
'Listen, dear Margaret,' said he, putting one arm round her waist.
A soul that desires to serve and honour Him shall never want opportunity to do it; nor must thou so limit the Holy One of Israel as to think He hath but one way in which He can glorify Himself by thee.
Margaret sighed, as if standing on the verge of some new horror. He began again, speaking rapidly, as if to get over a set task:
mr Hale shook his head despondingly: he pressed her hand in token of gratitude.
'But, father,' said she, suddenly lifting up her flushed, tear wet face, 'the early martyrs suffered for the truth, while you-oh!
As her fingers were on the handle he called her back.
She forgot that he had not made them an offer.
I am going to leave Helstone.'
You cannot mean that you are really going to leave the Church-to give up Helstone-to be for ever separate from me, from mamma-led away by some delusion-some temptation!
'In a fortnight!'
He was gone.
Would you dislike breaking it to her very much, Margaret?'
'Bread for your family!
Surely, if the bishop were told all we know about Frederick, and the hard, unjust-'
A hundred is left.
God forgive me!'
What was to be done?
At last he said,
Do tell me!'
It would be different.
What could he mean?
'Your poor mother's fond wish, gratified at last in the mocking way in which over fond wishes are too often fulfilled-Sodom apples as they are-has brought on this crisis, for which I ought to be, and I hope I am thankful.
But why?'
Margaret was preparing her mother's worsted work, and rather shrinking from the thought of the long evening, and wishing bed time were come that she might go over the events of the day again.
Margaret went up to dress for the early tea, finding Dixon in a pretty temper from the interruption which a visitor had naturally occasioned on a busy day.
I think I could do anything but that: the idea of her distress turns me sick with dread.
His trials are over.
Margaret, I tried to do it; I tried to content myself with simply refusing the additional preferment, and stopping quietly here,--strangling my conscience now, as I had strained it before.
'No!' said mr Hale. 'That would not answer.
'Yes,' said he, in the same despondent, indifferent way.
You and mamma have some money, independent of the income from the living, have not you?
Thou wilt have little thanks, O my soul!
Was it to be so sudden then?
Margaret was nearly upset again into a burst of crying.
He swallowed down the dry choking sobs which had been heaving up from his heart hitherto, and going to his bookcase he took down a volume, which he had often been reading lately, and from which he thought he had derived strength to enter upon the course in which he was now embarked.
Oh! it seems so terrible, so shocking,' said Margaret, suddenly bursting into tears.
Margaret resolved to keep silence.
Well, I had reason to suspect-to imagine-I had better say nothing about it, however.
'I do not know exactly.
And it is owing to him we are going to Milton.'
mr Hale sat in rigid stillness while she spoke.
He has lived an easy life in his college all his days.
mr Hale continued: 'A few months ago, when my misery of doubt became more than I could bear without speaking, I wrote to mr Bell-you remember mr Bell, Margaret?'
'Margaret, I return to the old sad burden we must leave Helstone.'
I think we could.'
You must have many painful things to do.'
I mean, can you leave it and come into my study?
Oh, if I were not married-if I were but myself in the world, how easy it would be!
They make me so undecided.'
As he read this, and glanced at much more which he did not read, he gained resolution for himself, and felt as if he too could be brave and firm in doing what he believed to be right; but as he ceased he heard Margaret's low convulsive sob; and his courage sank down under the keen sense of suffering.
The house was shut up for the evening.
I cannot bear to give pain.
It is that that is the great perplexity.'
I don't know that he gave me much strength.
Her mother came into the room before this whirl of thoughts was adjusted into anything like order.
At any rate, he has property there, which has very much increased in value since Milton has become such a large manufacturing town.
At any rate, there is an opening, as I have said, for a private tutor.
'Margaret, I am a poor coward after all.
Nothing is fixed,' said her father, with anxious hesitation, as he noticed the filmy sorrow that came over her eyes, and the sudden change in her complexion.
Margaret was almost stunned.
'Yes, papa, it had better be fixed soon and decidedly, as you say.
Then he read aloud,--
'Yes.
'Poor Maria!' replied mr Hale, tenderly.
But when?'
'You could not understand it all, if I told you-my anxiety, for years past, to know whether I had any right to hold my living-my efforts to quench my smouldering doubts by the authority of the Church.
Frederick was an outlaw.
Margaret did dislike it, did shrink from it more than from anything she had ever had to do in her life before.
I wanted to talk it over with you.
He is a Fellow of Plymouth College there.
I shall have to take my deed of resignation, and wait upon the bishop myself, to bid him farewell.
When God will not use thee in one kind, yet He will in another.
Oh!
Margaret, I will tell you about it.
But I felt sure of sympathy from mr Bell.
If I tell you all, perhaps you could break it to her to morrow.
She sat by herself at the fire, with unlighted candles on the table behind her, thinking over the day, the happy walk, happy sketching, cheerful pleasant dinner, and the uncomfortable, miserable walk in the garden.
'Margaret!' said mr Hale, at last, in a sort of sudden desperate way, that made her start.
I have borne long with self reproach that would have roused any mind less torpid and cowardly than mine.' He shook his head as he went on.
She showed it by brushing away viciously at Margaret's hair, under pretence of being in a great hurry to go to mrs Hale.
'Yes!
But she recovered herself immediately.
It is not a month since the bishop offered me another living; if I had accepted it, I should have had to make a fresh declaration of conformity to the Liturgy at my institution.
He rose and walked up and down the room, speaking low words of self reproach and humiliation, of which Margaret was thankful to hear but few.
At length he stopped and replied:
To her surprise, her father began to walk about again before he answered.
'I cannot stand objections.
You see, your mother knows nothing about it yet: but I think, in a fortnight;--after my deed of resignation is sent in, I shall have no right to remain.
I will answer any questions this once, but after to night let us never speak of it again.
The one staid foundation of her home, of her idea of her beloved father, seemed reeling and rocking.
I can meet the consequences of my painful, miserable doubts; but it is an effort beyond me to speak of what has caused me so much suffering.'
'Because there I can earn bread for my family.
'Milton Northern!
Seventy of that has always gone to Frederick, since he has been abroad.
Besides, in a country parish I should be so painfully reminded of Helstone, and my duties here.
He will come to stay with us to morrow.
Could he have become implicated in anything Frederick had done?
Margaret was almost overpowered with the idea that her mother knew nothing of it all, and yet the affair was so far advanced!
No: we must go to Milton.
thought Margaret; and yet perhaps it was as well.
Then she took it into her head that, after all, his lightness might be but assumed, to cover a bitterness of disappointment which would have been stamped on her own heart if she had loved and been rejected.
It is all myself.
But nothing to the shock she received from mr Hale's last speech.
He made her take a chair by him; he stirred the fire, snuffed the candles, and sighed once or twice before he could make up his mind to say-and it came out with a jerk after all-'Margaret!
Margaret could not bear the sight of the suspense, which was even more distressing to her father than to herself.
Margaret had imagined nothing less than that some of the preferments which her mother so much desired had befallen her father at last-something that would force him to leave beautiful, beloved Helstone, and perhaps compel him to go and live in some of the stately and silent Closes which Margaret had seen from time to time in cathedral towns.
The manufacturing town in Darkshire?'
I don't know if he wants it all,' he continued in a hesitating manner.
There is a curate appointed to read prayers-a mr Brown.
Why can you no longer be a clergyman?
'Yes.
Some want their children to be better instructed than they themselves have been.
Yet, after all, Margaret had to wait a long time in the drawing room before her mother came down.
How different men were to women!
I must do something.
Then she arose and went, without another word or look, towards the door.
'Leave Helstone, papa!
'When do we go?' asked Margaret, after a short silence.
Discordant as it was-with almost a detestation for all she had ever heard of the North of England, the manufacturers, the people, the wild and bleak country-there was this one recommendation-it would be different from Helstone, and could never remind them of that beloved place.
'Because I must no longer be a minister in the Church of England.'
'No; I never saw him, I think.
Only help me to tell your mother.
Frederick's godfather-your old tutor at Oxford, don't you mean?'
'You shall be told all, Margaret.
I see.
I could not bear it, Margaret.
What could she say?
'Is that tapestry thing of immediate consequence?
There now, what is it?"
Now, then, what did you do to your hair?"
She says she thinks it will be very becoming.
Dyed your hair!
I used up the whole bottle, and oh, Marilla, when I saw the dreadful color it turned my hair I repented of being wicked, I can tell you.
I have proof now-green hair is proof enough for anybody.
"Oh, Marilla, what shall I do?" questioned Anne in tears.
How could I doubt his word, Marilla?
I don't believe in encouraging them to come around at all."
Anne's clipped head made a sensation in school on the following Monday, but to her relief nobody guessed the real reason for it, not even Josie Pye, who, however, did not fail to inform Anne that she looked like a perfect scarecrow.
"She's not here when I told her to stay," retorted Marilla.
It seems such a tragic thing."
This is such an unromantic affliction.
She may be bright and sweet enough, but her head is full of nonsense and there's never any knowing what shape it'll break out in next.
You can't go out with it looking like that."
I think the peddler had a very kind heart, for he said that, seeing it was me, he'd sell it for fifty cents and that was just giving it away.
It certainly had a very strange appearance.
Oh, Marilla, you little know how utterly wretched I am."
The spring was abroad in the land and Marilla's sober, middle aged step was lighter and swifter because of its deep, primal gladness.
But I'm bringing her up, not you."
Please, Marilla, go away and don't look at me."
I'll have to see a doctor about them.
But there!
My career is closed.
Oh, Marilla, 'what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.' That is poetry, but it is true.
People have pretty well forgotten my other mistakes-the liniment cake and setting Diana drunk and flying into a temper with mrs Lynde.
Accordingly, Anne washed her hair, scrubbing it vigorously with soap and water, but for all the difference it made she might as well have been scouring its original red.
"Dyed it!
Never in all her life had Marilla seen anything so grotesque as Anne's hair at that moment.
Goodness knows what's to be done.
It makes you feel very virtuous when you forgive people, doesn't it?
In a trice I saw myself with beautiful raven black hair and the temptation was irresistible.
"I didn't say anything when Josie said that to me," Anne confided that evening to Marilla, who was lying on the sofa after one of her headaches, "because I thought it was part of my punishment and I ought to bear it patiently.
Lighting it, she turned around to see Anne herself lying on the bed, face downward among the pillows.
Marilla, I CANNOT face Josie Pye.
But there is nothing comforting in having your hair cut off because you've dyed it a dreadful color, is there?
But they'll never forget this.
With a dismal sigh she went for the scissors.
Of course I knew you'd take her part, matthew.
What have you done?
"Yes, I will, too.
I'm in the depths of despair and I don't care who gets head in class or writes the best composition or sings in the Sunday school choir any more.
The peddler said it was warranted to dye any hair a beautiful raven black and wouldn't wash off.
Why, it's GREEN!"
I mean to devote all my energies to being good after this and I shall never try to be beautiful again.
"I reckon she'll find it hard to explain THAT to my satisfaction.
"Perhaps you're judging her too hasty, Marilla.
"Who said?
"I can never live this down.
At the end of the week Marilla said decidedly:
"no
But I'm bringing her up and not Rachel Lynde, who'd pick faults in the Angel Gabriel himself if he lived in Avonlea.
He spoke so feelingly about them that it touched my heart.
I know what it feels like to have your word doubted.
But please, Marilla, go away and don't look at me.
"The peddler that was here this afternoon.
"But I thought it was worth while to be a little wicked to get rid of red hair.
During that time she went nowhere and shampooed her hair every day.
Vanity and Vexation of Spirit
"Oh, I didn't let him in the house.
I must say, with all her faults, I never found her disobedient or untrustworthy before and I'm real sorry to find her so now."
Get right up this minute and tell me.
Anne's unhappiness continued for a week.
I'm going to weep all the time you're cutting it off, if it won't interfere.
I never thought I was vain about my hair, of all things, but now I know I was, in spite of its being red, because it was so long and thick and curly.
Marilla was not given to subjective analysis of her thoughts and feelings.
Oh, I feel that my heart is broken.
And I've been repenting ever since."
I counted the cost, Marilla.
"Are you sick then?" demanded Marilla anxiously, going over to the bed.
Consequently, when Marilla entered her kitchen and found the fire black out, with no sign of Anne anywhere, she felt justly disappointed and irritated.
I am the unhappiest girl in Prince Edward Island."
"I dyed it."
This minute, I say.
"My head is better now.
Here I am saying the very thing I was so riled with Rachel Lynde for saying at the Aid today.
"Come right down to the kitchen-it's too cold up here-and tell me just what you've done.
It was dark when supper was ready, and still no sign of Anne, coming hurriedly over the log bridge or up Lover's Lane, breathless and repentant with a sense of neglected duties.
I wanted to buy something from him to help him in such a worthy object.
It was terrible bad this afternoon, though. These headaches of mine are getting worse and worse.
You haven't got into any scrape for over two months, and I was sure another one was due.
I don't care if mrs Allan does say she's the brightest and sweetest child she ever knew.
"No," was the muffled reply.
CHAPTER twenty seven.
Of course it's better to be good.
Then all at once I saw the bottle of hair dye.
Besides, I meant to be extra good in other ways to make up for it."
Does it hurt your head?"
I will call it a snood-that sounds so romantic.
"I thought nothing could be as bad as red hair.
"I'll settle Miss Anne when she comes home," said Marilla grimly, as she shaved up kindlings with a carving knife and with more vim than was strictly necessary.
I wouldn't have dyed it green."
They will think I am not respectable.
"I'll never, never look at myself again until my hair grows," she exclaimed passionately.
"Look at my hair, Marilla," she whispered.
And I won't try to imagine it away, either.
Little things like that are of no importance now because I don't suppose I'll ever be able to go anywhere again.
And oh, how Josie Pye will laugh!
Anne's lips quivered, but she realized the bitter truth of Marilla's remarks.
Marilla washed and put away the dishes grimly.
I do really want to be good, Marilla, like you and mrs Allan and Miss Stacy, and grow up to be a credit to you.
Your hair must be cut off; there is no other way.
Marilla had done her work thoroughly and it had been necessary to shingle the hair as closely as possible. The result was not becoming, to state the case as mildly as may be.
"Perhaps after a while I'll get used to it, but I'm afraid concerts spoil people for everyday life.
"I can scarcely realize that I'm in my teens.
But I'm glad Miss Barry liked them.
It makes life seem so much more interesting. In two more years I'll be really grown up.
Miss Josephine Barry wrote back that she had never read anything so amusing in her life.
"If I had Alice Bell's crooked nose," said Anne decidedly, "I wouldn't-but there!
To be sure, the concert left traces.
They were buried in the one grave and their funeral was most imposing, Diana.
She puts too much lovemaking into her stories and you know too much is worse than too little.
But I'm afraid that is an uncharitable speech.
All the good people are rewarded and all the bad ones are suitably punished.
mrs Lynde says it is.
Jane's stories are extremely sensible. Then Diana puts too many murders into hers.
Eventually, however, Avonlea school slipped back into its old groove and took up its old interests.
None of the Sloanes would have any dealings with the Bells, because the Bells had declared that the Sloanes had too much to do in the program, and the Sloanes had retorted that the Bells were not capable of doing the little they had to do properly.
I feel just now that I may grow up to be sensible yet.
The Story Club Is Formed
Jane and Ruby almost always cry when I come to the pathetic parts.
CHAPTER twenty six.
Oh, Diana, look, there's a rabbit.
It's called 'The Jealous Rival; or In Death Not Divided.' I read it to Marilla and she said it was stuff and nonsense.
You've been thirteen for a month, so I suppose it doesn't seem such a novelty to you as it does to me.
It's a sad, sweet story.
The winter weeks slipped by.
"It would be if you'd only cultivate it," said Anne cheeringly.
I suppose that is why Marilla disapproves of them. Marilla is such a sensible woman.
mr Allan says so.
Josie Pye and Julia Bell did not "speak" for three months, because Josie Pye had told Bessie Wright that Julia Bell's bow when she got up to recite made her think of a chicken jerking its head, and Bessie told Julia.
mrs Lynde says there is no danger of my ever being one, but you can never tell.
At first, as she told Diana, she did not really think she could.
Could she go back to the former quiet pleasures of those faraway days before the concert?
My besetting sin is imagining too much and forgetting my duties.
mrs Lynde says she always feels shocked when she hears of anyone ever having been naughty, no matter how small they were.
Cordelia was a regal brunette with a coronet of midnight hair and duskly flashing eyes.
I wish my imagination was as good as yours."
"In four more years we'll be able to put our hair up," said Diana. "Alice Bell is only sixteen and she is wearing hers up, but I think that's ridiculous.
I found it rather hard to imagine the proposal because I had no experience to go by.
You may have noticed that.
"Ruby Gillis says she means to have a beau as soon as she's fifteen," said Diana.
Reading stories is bad enough but writing them is worse."
I just lay awake and imagined the concert over and over again.
mrs Allan says that ought to be our object in everything.
Junior Avonlea found it hard to settle down to humdrum existence again.
To Anne in particular things seemed fearfully flat, stale, and unprofitable after the goblet of excitement she had been sipping for weeks.
Ruby Gillis is rather sentimental.
Do you think there is any prospect of it, Marilla?"
It's about two beautiful maidens called Cordelia Montmorency and Geraldine Seymour who lived in the same village and were devotedly attached to each other.
I mostly always have to tell them what to write about, but that isn't hard for I've millions of ideas."
With the exception of these trifling frictions, work in Miss Stacy's little kingdom went on with regularity and smoothness.
I simply can't talk about Josie Pye without making an uncharitable speech, so I never mention her at all.
The idea of Miss Stacy telling us to write a story out of our own heads!"
Then Bertram DeVere came to their native village and fell in love with the fair Geraldine.
It really is a great comfort to me.
I asked Ruby Gillis if she knew anything about how men proposed because I thought she'd likely be an authority on the subject, having so many sisters married.
I won't say what I was going to because it was extremely uncharitable.
"Each girl has to read her story out loud and then we talk it over.
"I don't see how you can make up such thrilling things out of your own head, Anne.
The moral is the great thing.
As for Cordelia, she went insane with remorse and was shut up in a lunatic asylum.
I'm trying to be as much like mrs Allan as I possibly can, for I think she's perfect. mr Allan thinks so too.
mrs Allan says we should never make uncharitable speeches; but they do slip out so often before you think, don't they?
"I wrote it last Monday evening.
"I'm sure mrs Allan was never such a silly, forgetful little girl as you are."
Geraldine had an alabaster brow too.
I shall wait until I'm seventeen."
This was how the story club came into existence.
"Well, what became of Cordelia and Geraldine?" asked Diana, who was beginning to feel rather interested in their fate.
Geraldine accepted him in a speech a page long.
It shows our club is doing some good in the world.
Besides, I was comparing it with my own nose and that's vanity.
"I never saw anybody with purple eyes," said Diana dubiously.
"How perfectly lovely!" sighed Diana, who belonged to Matthew's school of critics.
I read one of my stories to him and mrs Allan and they both agreed that the moral was excellent.
You ought to cultivate your imagination, you know. Miss Stacy says so.
I'll help you along until you can do them by yourself.
"No; but she wasn't always so good as she is now either," said Anne seriously.
I'm afraid I think too much about my nose ever since I heard that compliment about it long ago.
"I insist upon that.
It must be a great deal better to be sensible; but still, I don't believe I'd really want to be a sensible person, because they are so unromantic.
"I shouldn't say there was a great deal" was Marilla's encouraging answer.
I wanted something out of the common.
I'm sure that must have a wholesome effect.
"Just think, Diana, I'm thirteen years old today," remarked Anne in an awed voice.
I can tell you I took a lot of trouble with that speech.
But she pretended to be Geraldine's friend the same as ever.
That's something to remember for our woods composition.
They're so white and still, as if they were asleep and dreaming pretty dreams."
But perhaps that is only because I'm tired.
I do really try to make it my object but I forget so often when I'm having fun.
"They grew in beauty side by side until they were sixteen.
You know so much more than you did when you were only twelve."
"I think this story writing business is the foolishest yet," scoffed Marilla.
Only we must take the right way.
"Ruby Gillis thinks of nothing but beaus," said Anne disdainfully. "She's actually delighted when anyone writes her name up in a take notice for all she pretends to be so mad.
I suppose you have your composition all done?"
It was certainly extremely difficult to be dignified under the circumstances!
It was splendid to fish for trout over the bridge and the two girls learned to row themselves about in the little flat bottomed dory mr Barry kept for duck shooting.
"It makes me feel frightened, girls.
An Unfortunate Lily Maid
Now push the flat off."
It was Anne's idea that they dramatize Elaine.
Anne's plan was hailed with enthusiasm.
Can't we be good friends?
She hated Gilbert Blythe!
Now, a red haired person cannot be a lily maid."
The flat began to leak.
Jane rose to the occasion.
Where were the oars?
For a moment Anne hesitated.
"Oh, Anne, how splendid of him!
We can't have the old dumb servitor because there isn't room for two in the flat when one is lying down.
It's silly for Elaine to be talking when she's dead."
Suppose nobody ever came!
Dyeing my hair cured me of vanity.
Why didn't somebody come?
The Haunted Wood mistake cured me of letting my imagination run away with me.
And today's mistake is going to cure me of being too romantic.
She would never forgive him!
"Oh, yes, I think I will, Marilla," returned Anne optimistically.
Let's be friends."
I'd be popping up every minute or so to see where I was and if I wasn't drifting too far out.
That scene of two years before flashed back into her recollection as vividly as if it had taken place yesterday.
And there I was, mrs Allan, clinging to that slippery old pile with no way of getting up or down.
But first you must be the brothers and the father.
You know the piles are just old tree trunks and there are lots of knots and old branch stubs on them.
"No," she said coldly, "I shall never be friends with you, Gilbert Blythe; and I don't want to be!"
Without waiting for an answer he pulled close to the pile and extended his hand.
CHAPTER twenty eight.
A white lily was not obtainable just then, but the effect of a tall blue iris placed in one of Anne's folded hands was all that could be desired.
Ruby ought to be Elaine because she is so fair and has such lovely long golden hair-Elaine had 'all her bright hair streaming down,' you know.
You know Elaine 'lay as though she smiled.' That's better.
And Ruby is in hysterics-oh, Anne, how did you escape?"
"Ruby, you shouldn't talk about mrs Lynde," said Anne severely.
She was really quite unstrung, for the reaction from her fright and cramped clinging was making itself felt.
She almost wished she had answered Gilbert differently.
Help would soon come, but meanwhile her position was a very uncomfortable one.
Left behind at the landing!
I think your hair is awfully pretty now-honest I do.
"Now, she's all ready," said Jane.
It's fun then.
And you know, Anne, that would spoil the effect."
Her heart gave a quick, queer little beat.
We've gone and lost your father's flat, Diana, and I have a presentiment that we'll not be allowed to row on the pond any more."
Her imagination began to suggest all manner of gruesome possibilities to her.
"Your complexion is just as fair as Ruby's," said Diana earnestly, "and your hair is ever so much darker than it used to be before you cut it."
I feel quite sure that you will soon see a great improvement in me in this respect, Marilla."
It is all my fault.
"Ruby, you must be King Arthur and Jane will be Guinevere and Diana must be Lancelot.
"I'll never ask you to be friends again, Anne Shirley.
I feel sure I was born under an unlucky star.
Great was the consternation in the Barry and Cuthbert households when the events of the afternoon became known.
"I don't see how," said Marilla.
"Of course I won't," flashed Anne, with a momentary return of her old spirit.
The girls went for help.
"But it's so ridiculous to have a redheaded Elaine," mourned Anne.
And I don't care either!"
The black shawl having been procured, Anne spread it over the flat and then lay down on the bottom, with closed eyes and hands folded over her breast.
It was probably easy enough in towered Camelot hundreds of years ago, but romance is not appreciated now.
Under such circumstances you don't think much about making a flowery prayer.
"What has happened, Anne?" asked Gilbert, taking up his oars.
They had often gone down like this and nothing could be more convenient for playing Elaine.
"I'm not afraid to float down and I'd love to be Elaine.
Suppose they had fainted, one and all!
But it's ridiculous just the same.
I'm awfully sorry I made fun of your hair that time.
Where had the girls gone?
The affair of the amethyst brooch cured me of meddling with things that didn't belong to me.
There was one chance-just one.
But to lie down and pretend I was dead-I just couldn't.
Of course, he had insulted her terribly, but still-!
"All right!" Gilbert sprang into his skiff with an angry color in his cheeks.
A good cry, indulged in the grateful solitude of the east gable, had soothed her nerves and restored her to her wonted cheerfulness.
Jane, you arrange this.
The flat was accordingly pushed off, scraping roughly over an old embedded stake in the process.
But the bitterness of her old grievance promptly stiffened up her wavering determination.
At this rate the flat would fill and sink long before it could drift to the lower headland.
I prayed, mrs Allan, most earnestly, but I didn't shut my eyes to pray, for I knew the only way God could save me was to let the flat float close enough to one of the bridge piles for me to climb up on it.
"Will you ever have any sense, Anne?" groaned Marilla.
"It spoils the effect because this is hundreds of years before mrs Lynde was born.
Do you think it could be called auburn now, Diana?"
I said a grateful prayer at once and then I gave all my attention to holding on tight, for I knew I should probably have to depend on human aid to get back to dry land."
She had an odd, newly awakened consciousness under all her outraged dignity that the half shy, half eager expression in Gilbert's hazel eyes was something that was very good to see.
Gilbert obligingly rowed to the landing and Anne, disdaining assistance, sprang nimbly on shore.
"I could never have the courage to float down there."
mrs Lynde says that all play acting is abominably wicked."
I made the quarrel up, and afterwards got Giorgio into Cardinal de  Medici  s household, and continually helped him.
I was tormented by thirst, but had abstained from drinking for many days according to the doctors  orders.
I meanwhile was waiting, and put my hands among the breast feathers of the geese, and felt them very warm.
I told him that I had come therein that way solely in order to clear my character.
Accordingly she allowed me twice to take as much as I could of the water, so that in good earnest I swallowed more than a flask full.
That day many friends came to see me; among others Pier Landi, who was the best and dearest friend I ever had.
You have never made anything so exquisite, which proves you our inveterate foe and their devoted friend; and yet the Pope and he have had it twice in mind to hang you without any fault of yours. That was the Father and the Son; now beware of the Holy Ghost.  It was firmly believed that Duke Alessandro was the son of Pope Clement.
MY sickness had been of such a very serious nature that it seemed impossible for me to fling it off.
It was close upon nightfall, and during the day I had shot a good number of ducks and geese; then, as I had almost made my mind up to shoot no more that time, we were returning briskly toward Rome.
Trusting to my boots, which came high up the leg, I put one foot forward; it sank in the oozy ground; and so, although I got the goose, the boot of my right leg was full of water.
We often held such conversations; but I remember one in particular on the day of Epiphany, when we were together near La Magliana.
This woke me up, and I called out:   Leave her alone; perhaps, when she meant to do me harm, she did me more good than you were able to do with all your efforts.
Cardinal Cornaro, when he heard of my improvement, had me transported to a place of his on Monte Cavallo.
WHEN eight days had come and gone, my amendment was so slight that life itself became almost a burden to me; indeed I had been more than fifty days in that great suffering.
The Duke gazed at me, and marvelled I was still alive; afterwards he bade me take heed to be an honest man and regain my health.
You see his malady has been so grave, that if we had brought him the extreme unction, we might not have been in time.
The very evening I was taken with great precautions in a chair, well wrapped up and protected from the cold.
For these deserts, then, he told Duke Alessandro that I had abused his Excellency, and had bragged I meant to be the first to leap upon the walls of Florence with his foes the exiles.
That worthy man Maestro Francesco da Norcia redoubled his efforts, and brought me every day fresh remedies, trying to restore strength to my miserable unstrung frame.
Then, after a short while, the Duke came by; whereupon I had myself raised up before his Excellency, and he halted.
Do not permit him any irregularities; for though he has escaped this time, another disorder now would be the death of him.
If you knew that his recovery depended upon his drinking two flasks of water, why did you not say so before?
He then said,   Beware,  and added:   What displeasure have you given to that rascal Ottaviano de  Medici?  I answered that I had done nothing to displease him, but that he had injured me; and told him all the affair about the Mint.
Now he had heard the Duke say:   Benvenuto would have done much better to die, because he is come to put his head into a noose, and I will never pardon him.  Accordingly when Niccolò arrived, he said to me in desperation:   Alas! my dear Benvenuto, what have you come to do here?
They kept and showed it to the doctor, who said he had never seen anything of the sort before, and afterwards remarked to Felice:   Now take care of your Benvenuto, for he is cured.
This maid had stolen from me certain little things of some importance, and in her fear of being detected, she would have been very glad if I had died.
That old man ceased to give so much annoyance, yet sometimes he appeared to me in dreams.
Maestro Francesco then gave orders that I should be removed from my room and carried to one of the hills there are in Rome.
He repeated:   Get hence as quickly as you can, and be of good courage, for you will see your vengeance executed sooner than you expect.  I the best attention to my health, gave Pietro Pagolo advice about stamping the coins, and then went off upon my way to Rome without saying a word to the Duke or anybody else.
He had been brought by my very dear friend Luca Martini, who passed the larger portion of the day with me.
This man had no skill in my art; but since we were perpetually day and night together, everybody thought he was a first rate craftsman.
I responded that he had done well to tell me so, and that I would take such care of them that he should never see them more.
This being so, as he was a fellow of much humour, we used often to laugh together about the great credit he had gained.
I lifted my foot and let the water run out; then, when I had mounted, we made haste for Rome.
I therefore dismounted at once, got my fowling piece ready, and at a very long range brought two of them down with a single ball.
So I made my mind up, and prepared to travel.
He denied that it was so, and that he had ever said anything of the sort.
I now sent to Florence to request Lorenzino that he would send me the reverse of the medal.
I composed the design of a reverse which seemed to me appropriate, and pressed the work forward to my best ability.
Yet all these endeavours were apparently insufficient to overcome the obstinacy of my malady, so that the physicians were in despair and at their wits  ends what to do.
Of the two geese, one was almost dead, and the other, though badly wounded, was flying lamely.
Did you not know what you have done to displease the Duke?
I never used to shoot with more than one ball, and was usually able to hit my mark at two hundred cubits, which cannot be done by other ways of loading.
The doe had no doubt now.
One was rowing; the other had a gun in his hand.
It was repeated.
Flight with the fawn was impossible.
There was silence all about in the forest.
The doe lifted her head with a quick motion.
After running at high speed perhaps half a mile farther, it occurred to her that it would be safe now to turn to the west, and, by a wide circuit, seek her fawn.
In five minutes more she had passed into a hillside clearing.
The dogs were gaining again, and she crossed the broad, deep brook.
If she could put that piece of water between her and her pursuers, she would be safe.
If the mother stepped a pace or two farther away in feeding, the fawn made a half movement, as if to rise and follow her.
She descended the slope of the mountain until she reached the more open forest of hard wood.
By this time the dogs, panting and lolling out their tongues, came swinging along, keeping the trail, like stupids, and consequently losing ground when the deer doubled.
In five minutes more she heard the sharp yelp of discovery, and then the deep mouthed howl of pursuit.
She heard a tinkle of bells.
The cry of the hound was repeated, more distinct this time.
She went in the direction of the hounds.
The fawn lay down contentedly, and the doe licked him for a moment.
Had she strength to swim it?
She must cross the Slide Brook valley, if possible, and gain the mountain opposite.
There was a sound, a distinct, prolonged note, pervading the woods.
He wanted more breakfast, for one thing; and his mother wouldn't stand still.
The danger was certain now; it was near.
At her first step into the water she saw a sight that sent her back with a bound.
There was a boat mid lake; two men were in it.
With an affectionate glance at her fawn, she continued picking up her breakfast.
There was no time for hesitation.
The fording of the river threw the hounds off for a time.
Not a merciful heart in all that lovely valley.
The brave, pretty creature was quite exhausted now.
She bounded on; she stopped.
She could not crawl on in this way; the dogs would soon be upon them.
The mother bounded away a few paces.
Late in the afternoon she staggered down the shoulder of Bartlett, and stood upon the shore of the lake.
But at the moment she heard a sound that chilled her heart.
The baying of the hounds grew fainter behind.
Whenever the fawn caught up, he was quite content to frisk about.
He went to feed on the lily pads there.
It was the cry of a hound to the west of her.
She hesitated; it was only for an instant.
The buck, his father, had been that night on a long tramp across the mountain to Clear Pond, and had not yet returned.
From the valley ahead came the cry of a searching hound.
The doe was daintily cropping tender leaves and turning from time to time to regard her offspring.
That way also her enemies were.
But there was the fawn.
She turned again for flight.
In a moment more she leaped into the travelled road.
She was going due east, when she turned away toward the north, and kept on at a good pace.
The dogs were not in sight, but she could hear them coming down the hill.
The courage of the panting fugitive was not gone, but the fearful pace at which she had been going told on her.
She turned her head to the south; she listened intently.
Time enough to fly; time enough to put miles between her and the hound before he should come upon her fresh trail; yes, time enough.
What should she do?
But when the doe had got into the timber, she heard the savage brutes howling across the meadow. (It is well enough, perhaps, to say that nobody offered to shoot the dogs.)
She turned again to the centre of the lake.
With only a moment's hesitation she plunged into the lake.
As she approached Slide Brook, she saw a boy standing by a tree with a raised rifle.
Her legs trembled, and her heart beat like a trip hammer.
The doe returned, stood by him, head erect and nostrils distended. Perhaps she was thinking.
The cruel sound gave wings to the poor thing.
Below her, down the mountain slope, were other clearings broken by patches of woods.
The doe saw the boat nearing her.
The doe bounded in advance and waited.
There was nothing to do but to keep on, and on she went, with the noise of the pack behind her.
A mile or two down lay the valley and the farmhouses.
She slowed her speed, but still fled up the right bank of the stream.
The fawn, scrambling after her, tumbled over, and bleated piteously.
But suddenly she started, head erect, eyes dilated, a tremor in her limbs.
The fawn scrambled after her, slipping and tumbling along, and whining a good deal because his mother kept always moving away from him.
She turned to the shore whence she came; the dogs were lapping the water and howling there.
She used the little respite to push on until the baying was faint in her ears.
It was a pretty picture,--maternal love on the one part, and happy trust on the other.
But man is nobler than other animals.
Therefore in that state women would not have been born.
Therefore from the first they would have been imperfect in bodily size and power.
But the same acts are not befitting to man at every season of life.
But in that state nothing would have been unnatural in human generation.
Therefore also in the state of innocence male and female would have been born.
Wherefore it is natural, on account of the considerable humidity of the brain in children, that the nerves which are instruments of movement, should not be apt for moving the limbs.
Therefore, in the state of innocence, children would not have been deprived of the use of their limbs.
Therefore, in the state of innocence, there was no need for women to be born.
Now it is clear that it is as natural as it is befitting to the principles of human nature that children should not have sufficient strength for the use of their limbs immediately after birth.
Wherefore, in making any assertion, we must be guided by the nature of things, except in those things which are above nature, and are made known to us by Divine authority.
Whether, in the Primitive State, Women Would Have Been Born?
Because in proportion to other animals man has naturally a larger brain.
Therefore neither would there have been weakness of body in infants.
But in the state of innocence children would have been begotten by generation.
Whether in the State of Innocence Children Would Have Had Perfect Strength of Body As to the Use of Its Members Immediately After Birth?
Therefore neither would there have been such weakness in infancy.
And they brought out the jaw bone of an ass with which Samson did such great feats, and the sling and stone with which David slew Goliath of Gath.
Christian.--I am come from the Town of Destruction, and am on my way to Mount Zion; but the day is far spent, and I would, with your leave, pass the night here.
But, ere he got to the top, the sun went down on Christian, and he soon saw that two wild beast stood in his way.
Christian.--Yes, I have.
Charity.--Have you a wife and babes?
Christian.--My name is now Christian, but at first it was Graceless.
Charity.--And did you pray to God to put it in their hearts to go with you?
I am made to tread those steps thrice which I need not to have trod but once; yea, now too I am like to be lost in the night, for the day is well nigh spent.
Ah, thought he, these beasts range in the night for their prey; and if they should meet with me in the dark, how should I fly from them?
Tell me, whence come you?
Watchful.--What is your name?
When Watchful told her why Christian had come there, she said: What is your name?
Christian.--Yes, and that with much warmth, for you may think how dear they were to me.
The sun is set.
Words are too weak to tell the joy of Christian when he had got back his scroll.
He laid it up in the breast of his coat and gave thanks to God.
Watchful.--How is it you came so late?
There, they say, is no death; and there I shall dwell with such as love the Lord.
I see now the cause of all those fears that drove Mistrust and Timorous back.
Fear not the two wild beasts, for they are bound by chains, and are put here to try the faith of those that have it, and to find out those that have none.
O that I had not slept!
Then they told him it was Immanuel's Land.
Christian.--Friend, what shall we do?
Shall we let Giant Despair rule us?
Who knows but that God, who made the world, may cause him to die, or lose the use of his limbs as he did at first.
Therefore the subjection of other animals to man is proved to be natural.
Whether Man Had Mastership Over All Other Creatures?
Now in man reason has the position of a master and not of a subject.
So in the state of innocence man had mastership over the animals by commanding them.
But man needed animals in order to have experimental knowledge of their natures.
Therefore in the state of innocence, before man had disobeyed, nothing disobeyed him that was naturally subject to him.
Secondly, this is proved by the order of Divine Providence which always governs inferior things by the superior.
There might also have been bodily disparity.
Whether Men Were Equal in the State of Innocence?
For Augustine says (De Civ.
Moreover, as regards the soul, there would have been inequality as to righteousness and knowledge.
But of the natural powers and the body itself man is master not by commanding, but by using them.
Therefore certain things in regard to animals could be done by angels, which could not be done by man; for instance, the rapid gathering together of all the animals.
Therefore all were equal.
This is signified by the fact that God led the animals to man, that he might give them names expressive of their respective natures.
Now an angel is naturally higher than man.
Therefore, etc
Wherefore man had no mastership over the angels in the primitive state; so when we read "all creatures," we must understand the creatures which are not made to God's image.
This can be proved in three ways.
First, because man is naturally a social being, and so in the state of innocence he would have led a social life.
"Yes, indeed.
"Well, I'm a rich man now, and so is my mate, McLaughlin, for that wood was contracted for by the largest and richest piano firm in this country, and now it is all but delivered to them and the money in our hands."
Well, then we were quarantined.
Well, it was a long, slow job to drag those heavy logs around that point, and just when we were making headway, along comes a storm that drove the schooner and canoes out of business."
THE HAPPY REUNION
The sun seemed stronger each time it made its way out from behind a cloud, just as little girls and boys grow strong in body by exercise, and strong in character by efforts to do right.
"And last night what an awful experience they had!" remarked one of the spectators.
"We counted on getting home last week, when this last storm struck us and drove us out of our course.
The rough ocean winds had tanned them like bronze, and their muscles were as firm and strong almost as the cables that swing out with the buoys.
Couldn't get things to eat without a lot of trouble, and couldn't go on with the carting until the authorities decided the fever was not serious.
Two vessels had been wrecked trying to get it, so when we got to the West Indies I decided to try canoes and not risk sails, where the wind always blew such a gale, it dragged any anchor that could be dropped.
It would have taken us a lifetime to accumulate as much money as we have earned in this year.
Of course, it was hard for the men who had families, McLaughlin especially; the others were all working sailors, but he was a landsman and my partner in the enterprise; but I will make it up to him, and the mahogany hunt will turn out the best paying piece of work he ever undertook."
"There is not much to tell," began the captain.
Here Mate McLaughlin told about the big storm and how long it took the small crew to repair the damage done to the sails.
CHAPTER twenty
"Besides," added someone else, "they are all going to receive extra good pay, for the captain and mate will be very rich when the cargo is landed."
"Of course I knew we were going to have trouble getting that mahogany.
"But we have to go to school," said Nan, "and we have only a few days more."
"It is no wonder that they are all so happy to night."
"Indeed I do not like shopping," answered the cousin.
A beautiful day had grown out of the dreadful storm.
"If there is one thing in this world worth while, it is fun," and she tossed her yellow head about like a buttercup, that has no other way of laughing.
I broke ten and injured more than I wanted to count."
How rugged and handsome the men looked!
"Oh, I'll come if you make it jolly," answered Dorothy.
"Then it was well worth all your sacrifice?" said mr Minturn.
He made the clerks remove all the truck from the aisles and I guess everybody was glad the army fell down.
The largest hotel at Sunset Beach was thrown open to the sailors that night, and here Captain Bingham and Mate McLaughlin, together with the rest of the crew, took up comfortable lodgings.
"No, she didn't, either," corrected Dorothy.
"But all the same," sighed Dorothy, "I just know you will all be going home before we leave for the city, and I shall just die of loneliness."
"You will never again have to go back to that horrid store that made you so pale, and your mother will have a lovely time and nothing to worry about."
"I can hardly believe it all," replied their little friend.
"I hope you can come to Lakeport for Thanksgiving," said Nan.
And everybody was so happy.
That was what delayed us so.
"Then we had to go back to work at the logs," went on the captain, "and then one of our crew took a fever.
"Oh, isn't it perfectly splendid!" declared Nan and Dorothy, hugging Nellie.
"We might be able to manage that, too," Nellie told him.
"Oh, yes, mother, I'm coming!" replied Nellie.
The last night at the seashore was passed, and the early morning found them once more traveling away-this time for dear old home, sweet home.
I wonder if all the other girls will be home at Lakeport in time for the first day of school?" said Nan.
Then, perhaps, we can give a real harvest party out at Lakeport and try to repay our friends for some of their hospitality to us."
"Vacation was just long enough, I think."
Those we get down here always seem soft and salty, like the spray."
"Most of them, I guess," answered Bert.
"Well, we have had a good vacation, and I am willing to go to work again."
"And we will be on hand, thank you," replied the joking Dorothy.
"If we only didn't have to leave our friends," complained Nan, brushing back a tear, as the very last glint of Cousin Dorothy's yellow head passed by the train window.
Where is your hat?"
Look!" called Flossie, as the train made a turn, and whistled a good by to the Bobbsey Twins at the Seashore.
There were the shells to be looked after, the fish nets, besides Downy, the duck, and Snoop, the cat.
"Perhaps they will buy another tent with it, for they need more room out at Meadow Brook."
CHAPTER twenty one
"There goes the last of the ocean.
"Be sure to have ice cream and chocolates-I want some good fresh chocolates.
And so our little friends had spent all their vacation.
"It is not long until Thanksgiving.
"You are quite rich now, aren't you?" remarked Dorothy.
"Oh, that will be splendid!" declared Nan.
"I hope we will meet them all soon again," said Nan's mother.
Bert had the donkey cart hitched and there was now no time to spare. Nellie kissed Freddie and Flossie affectionately, and promised to bring the little boy all through a big city, real fire engine house when he came to see her.
GOOD BY
"Come, Nellie," called mrs McLaughlin, "I am ready.
Now father is home again, I can hardly believe it!
mr Bobbsey was down from the city, of course, to take the family home, and now all hands, even Freddie and Flossie, were busy packing up.
Dorothy gave Nan a beautiful little gold locket with her picture in it, and Flossie received the dearest little real shell pocketbook ever seen.
"So am I!" declared Nan.
Arriving at Hartford on the thirty first of October, sixteen eighty seven, Andros found the general assembly in session in the meeting house.
"We humbly prostrate ourselves, our privileges, our all, at the gracious feet of your majesty, with an entire resolution to serve you with faithful hearts."
"Have you got it?"
"I remember such an order, and furthermore that all the colonies complied with his infamous demand save Connecticut.
"I saw him; he struck my hand in the dark; yet I knew it was he.
As long as American students shall study the history of their country, will "The Charter Oak" be famous.
Charles got as close to the long table used by the secretaries as possible, without attracting special attention.
They knew all their relatives in Virginia, Maryland and Carolinia.
"No; already I have waited too long.
"Treason!
The day was well nigh spent, when he arrived, and the members were engaged in a heated debate on a subject of the utmost importance.
The Stevens family was growing with the colonies.
Little did the captain or his youthful assistant dream that their simple act would make the old tree historic.
"What lights?"
"Yes."
mr Prince, to convince him of the danger they were in, continued:
"Yes, Charles, you will answer."
"I hope you will not endanger your own life----"
"I will do it at the exact moment, uncle.
The debate was drawing to a close, or, in fact, had gone as far as it could, without arousing the suspicion of Governor Andros.
"Wait----" began the president.
Before that body, with armed men at his back, he demanded a formal surrender of the precious charter into his hands.
The members received him with the courtesy due to his rank.
Andros appears as a usurper of authority-the willing instrument of King james the second, who, it seems, has determined to hold absolute rule over all New England."
"Nothing is easier."
"It was the boy," cried the enraged governor.
"That is true, Captain Wadsworth," continued mr Prince, "and, to subdue our stubbornness, this viceroy has come to Hartford with sixty armed men, to demand the surrender of the charter in person."
Will you fight them?"
"By no means; but I want you to be fully impressed with the seriousness of your mission."
The debate was at a white heat.
mr Prince fixed his amazed eyes on the captain's face and read there a desperate determination.
More than a dozen years had passed since Andros had been humiliated by Connecticut, and, despite his anathemas, the colony quietly pursued the even tenor of its way.
The fellow, though given to boasting, is not dangerous, or liable to put his threats into execution."
"I am."
They had reached the outskirts of the village and paused beneath the wide spreading branches of a great oak tree.
Time passed on, and darkness had enveloped the earth.
Charles Stevens saw the outline of his uncle, who seized the box and hurried with it from the meeting house.
"The liberties of the colony are involved.
mr Prince bowed and hastily returned to the house where the assembly was in session.
"He is from Massachusetts and beyond even the claimed bounds of your jurisdiction."
"He has promised to do so."
The people of Rhode Island were restive under the petty tyranny of Andros, and when they heard of the imprisonment of the despot at Boston, in sixteen eighty nine, they assembled at Newport, resumed popular government under the old charter, and began a new independent political career.
"They have enough to do in there," answered the boy, pointing toward the meeting house, in which pandemonium seemed to reign.
It will give us time.
For a few moments, the outwitted governor stood glaring at first one and then the other of the assembly.
As early as sixteen seventy five, he went to the mouth of the Connecticut River with a small naval force, to assert his authority.
"Where is the charter?" No one answered, and, with bosom swelling with indignation at being cheated by a device of the shrewd members of the assembly, he threatened to have them arrested.
Look well at the setting sun, you may not live to see it rise."
Marry! boy, have a care how you approach me.
"You do not expect me to be a coward?"
"Lights!
On the very day of the arrival of Charles Stevens at Hartford, while he was talking with Captain Wadsworth, his aunt's husband, a member of the colonial assembly suddenly entered the house, his face flushed with excitement.
Captain Wadsworth went out, and on his way looked into the State house where everything was going as well as he could have wished.
"What are you going to do with it?" Charles asked.
"Charles, you see the soldiers of Governor Andros at the State house?"
"Take your place, Charles, and be prepared to do your part," whispered Captain Wadsworth.
He found the debaters cudgelling their brains for something to say to the point or against it.
"I have not," answered one.
The members of the assembly were alarmed and amazed at his request.
"Nor i"
Every member of the assembly shook their heads.
Charles Stevens smiled and answered:
"Why should that alarm us?
Have no fear on that score."
I demand the charter at once.
"Yes."
Light the candles!" he cried, "and we will have peace." When the candles were relighted, the members were seen seated about the table in perfect order; but the charter could nowhere be seen.
Hasten back to the assembly and I will follow in a few moments."
"At the proper time, put out the lights in the assembly; but wait; I will go and muster the train bands, and have them at hand to prevent the governor's soldiers from injuring the members of the general assembly."
"But he has grown dangerous!" declared mr Prince.
At the end of that period, a most exciting incident occurred at Hartford, during the visit of Charles Stevens to that city.
"Uncle!"
He does not live in Connecticut."
Charles Stevens, but a youth, was on a visit to Connecticut, when an event transpired, which has since become historical.
"You have your soldiers at the door and we have the train bands of Connecticut ready to defend us against violence."
The sun was setting, and the captain said:
"Then you can put out the lights."
"Can you do it?"
"I have waited as long as I will.
"Come, Charles, let us hasten to the assembly.
Captain Wadsworth became a little uneasy, though he was still inclined to treat the matter lightly.
My train bands have their eyes on them."
I am going to do something desperate.
"What has happened, mr Prince?" Wadsworth asked, for he could see that the man was greatly excited.
"Who of you has the charter?"
"mr Prince, our liberties are in danger, and there is no time to think of life.
Never did debaters take greater interest in a minor subject.
There have been so many stories told of the Charter Oak that the author here feels justified in stepping aside from the narrative to quote from the journal for june fifteenth sixteen eighty seven, the following entry:
"Uncle, something terrible is going to happen, I know from your look and words.
"Are you willing to help us?"
"He shall not have it!"
"The imputation is false!"
It stood in a vacant lot on the south side of Charter Street, a few rods from Main Street, in the city of Hartford.
A terrible uproar and confusion inside attracted the attention of everybody, so Captain Wadsworth escaped without being noticed, with the precious document under his arm. The youth was close behind him and, when they were outside, seized his arm.
Why!
"Where does he live?"
"We do not know him.
As the student of American history doubtless knows, the tyrannical Governor Andros of New York, claimed dominion over all that scope of country denominated as the New Netherland, a very indefinite term applied to a great scope of country extending from Maryland to the Connecticut River, to which point Andros claimed jurisdiction.
Where is he?
When it ended, the governor of New York declared:
"Nor I," answered each and every one.
Once in the street they hastened away at a rapid pace.
This historical incident has about it all the rosy hues of romance.
"Governor Andros has come again," gasped mr Prince.
Won't you let me go with you?"
He followed him as rapidly as he could.
They may hear you."
"The boy did it!
As soon as he was gone, Charles Stevens said:
Though the lights were extinguished, through the windows the faint starlight dimly illuminated the scene.
"Hasten back, mr Prince, and whisper in the ears of every member to prolong the debate.
He consented, however, to await the discussion; but as soon as it was ended, he declared that he would have the charter.
We have no wish to shed their blood.
Bring it at once."
We have stubbornly refused to yield our charter voluntarily, for it is the guardian of our political rights."
"So this is another trick.
"What is the assembly doing?"
Then, while Charles stood as sentry, he went to the tree and put the charter in the hollow.
"Stand a little way off, Charles," commanded the captain.
"Safe and well," came the welcome answer.
A big roller dashing in finished the work for the life guards, and a man in the cork belt bounded upon shore.
mrs Bobbsey had been holding mrs McLaughlin back, but now the sailor was quite recovered, so they allowed her to speak to him.
"See, there goes the buoy," and then the queer looking life preserver made of cork, and shaped like breeches, swung out over the waves.
"And little Nellie!
Here she comes!" called the crowd presently, as the black speck far out, and the strain on the cord, showed the buoy was coming back.
Everybody gathered around, and Nellie with a strange face, and a stranger hope, broke through the crowd to see the rescued man.
mrs McLaughlin and her little daughter strained their eyes to see, if possible, what might be going on down at the beach.
Nearer and nearer it came, until now a man's head could be seen.
He was quite breathless when the guards reached him, but insisted on walking up instead of being carried.
LIFE SAVERS
They have found a wreck!"
"It is just like a story in a book."
"And is George Bingham out there?" anxiously asked the brother.
"I am," replied the sailor.
"Mother, mother!" called Nellie, "look down at the beach.
"And Hal and his father, too," put in Nan.
George Bingham!"
"Hello there!" called mr Bingham: "Well, if this isn't luck.
Just as mr Bingham said, the life saving work turned out to be a social affair, for there was a great time greeting Nellie's father and Hal's uncle.
"Yes, come along," answered mr Minturn, and as day began to peep through the heavy clouds, the two hurried down to the spot where the life guards were burning their red light to tell the sailors their signal had been seen.
"I only came in to tell you," began George Bingham, "that we are all right, and the boat is lifting off the sand bar we stuck on.
It was almost morning, but the black storm clouds held the daylight back.
The life guards are burning the red signal lights!
Even the guards, who were busy again at the ropes, having left the man to willing hands on the beach, could not hide their surprise over the fact that it was mother, father, and daughter there united under such strange conditions.
What a wonderful scene it was!
"It's a schooner," said mr Bingham to mr Minturn, "and she has a very heavy cargo."
With the daylight came girls and women to the beach.
"Just waiting for his turn to come in."
I guess our prayers were heard last night."
It was clear day now, and much of the wicked storm had passed.
It seemed a long time before any movement of the cable showed that the buoy was returning.
"Wasn't it perfectly splendid that Nellie and her mother were here!" declared Dorothy.
"What's that board for?" asked Bert, as he saw a board following the cable.
To this cord was fastened a heavy rope or cable.
"Here she comes!
As mr Bingham told the guards it would not be necessary to haul any more men in, and as the sea was calm enough now to launch a life boat, both Nellie's father and Hal's uncle insisted on going back to the vessel to the other men.
"There's the vessel!" exclaimed Bert, as a rocket flew up from the water.
The child almost unconscious in her father's arms, he almost dead from exhaustion, and the wife and mother too overcome to trust herself to believe it could be true.
What a morning that was at Sunset Beach!
Its effect upon the sea was, however, more furious every hour, for while the storm had left the land, it was raging somewhere else, and the sensitive sea felt every throb of the excited elements.
CHAPTER nineteen
Instantly there shot out to sea a ball of thin cord.
mr Bingham and Hal had been watching it all, anxiously.
"Oh, I see," said Bert, "the line will stretch then, and the breeches buoy will go out on a pulley."
"I'm so glad we prayed," said little Flossie to Freddie, when she heard the good news.
"So you've found friends, McLaughlin," he added, seeing the little family united. "Why, how do you do, mrs McLaughlin?" he went on, offering her his hand.
But I'm glad I came in to-the reception," he said, laughing.
"Yes, that's the distress signal," replied the uncle.
mrs Bobbsey, mrs Minturn, Nellie and her mother, besides Dorothy and Nan, were all there; Flossie and Freddie being obliged to stay home with Dinah and Susan.
Two boats were launched, a strong guard going in each, with mr McLaughlin in one and mr Bingham in the other, and now they pulled out steadily over the waves, back to the vessel that was freeing itself from the sand bar.
The girls and women were too frightened to talk, and Nellie clung close to her mother.
I am very fond of her.
In fact, she had perfectly confounded her ladyship by her demeanor.
When I find a fellow who's neither knave nor fool, I stick to him.
"Ah!" commented Barold.
"And you are not afraid?"
"It is scarcely a joyous occasion, to my mind."
She's prettier than ever to day, and is enjoying herself."
"It's deucedly bad form on his part," he said mentally.
Before breakfast Miss Belinda was startled by the arrival of another telegram, which ran as follows:--
"I'm not sure that I follow all her moods myself.
She-she has very pretty ways.
"Very few people understand Octavia," said Miss Belinda.
"Going to a funeral?" he demanded.
"Octavia is most happy to day," answered Miss Belinda.
Friend with me.
"Nothing whatever," he replied.
She is not as frivolous as she appears to those who don't know her well."
"Where?" he ejaculated.
She is usually paler.
"I beg you will not speak to me of that again," she said: "I will not listen." And turning about, she walked out of the room.
"Her father will reach Slowbridge this evening.
I shall not be afraid again."
Lady Theobald's manner was chiefly distinguished by an implacable rigidity.
"I made it myself."
"Burmistone," he said, after having spoken his first words, "who is that tall girl in white?"
"I had not observed it," answered her ladyship.
"Have you any message for my mother?
She was enjoying herself.
Don't deride my youth and ignorance, Miss Bassett."
"Well," remarked Octavia, "I suppose that would have been an advantage."
"MARTIN BASSETT."
"What has happened?" she asked rigidly.
"It's an old dress I remodelled," answered Lucia somewhat alarmed.
He was not very comfortable.
Where's Lucia?"
"Dear, dear Martin," she wept; "to think that we should meet again!
Barold stood gnawing his mustache, and made no reply.
"Don't call on grandmamma until after Wednesday," she had said to mr Burmistone: "perhaps she wouldn't let me go.
"No," she answered: "I am not afraid at all.
"I would rather try the other, thank you," he laughed.
mr Francis Barold observed it rather gloomily as he stood apart.
I never killed a man in my life."
"I say, what a name!
Octavia, on the contrary, did not ask what he meant by it.
"Arrived to day, per 'Russia.' Be with you tomorrow evening.
"If you go to Nevada, you must visit the mines at Bloody Gulch," she said.
If I were sure this was the same man, I'd go myself.
"I accompany my granddaughter to this-this entertainment," her ladyship responded.
Hand over those V's.)."
Day at length dawned.
(Deal, sir, if you please; better luck next time.)"
"What's the price of wood?"
The pilots here changed places.
"Hallo! the woodyard!"
Still, with all these disadvantages, they continued playing-they wanted to learn the game.
The wooding completed, we paddled on again.
The game went on, and the paddles kept moving.
We were nearing the shore, for the purpose of looking for wood, the banks being invisible from the middle of the river.
"Hallo, Colonel!
This wood seems rather better than that we took in at Yellow Face's, but we're nearly out again, and must be looking out for more.
"What did you understand?"
"Well," remarked Octavia, "you won't do it, I suppose.
Octavia," she added, turning upon her, with flushing cheeks and sparkling eyes, "I think that, for the first time in my life, I am in a passion,--a real passion.
"She was afraid to tell me in plain words.--I never saw her afraid before, but she was afraid.
Lucia thought deeply for a moment: she recognized, all at once, several things she had been mystified by before.
"Lucia," he said, "I wish you would let me go and talk with Lady Theobald."
She wondered if he had heard her last words: she fancied he had.
Dugald Binnie is at Oldclough."
There was a hint of exultation in her tone.
"I am angry!" she said.
But it was not against him that Lucia's indignation was aroused.
"He is my grand uncle," explained Lucia tremulously.
It is!" she said.
I will go home and tell her what I think."
If I make the marriage she chooses, she thinks mr Binnie will leave me his money. I am to run after a man who does not care for me, and make myself attractive, in the hope that he will condescend to marry me because mr Binnie may leave me his money.
"Yes," he answered.
"Who is he?"
"What did she say?" inquired Octavia.
mr Dugald Binnie had not proved to be a very fascinating person.
If she had only thought of it because mr Binnie came, I could have forgiven her more easily; but she has been making coarse plans all the time, and treating me with contempt.
I think I shall never be afraid of her any more." Her delicate nostrils were dilated, she held her head up, her breath came fast.
And then, almost before she knew what she was doing, she was pouring forth the whole of her story, even more of it than she had told Octavia. She had not at all intended to do it; but she did it, nevertheless.
Lucia sat thinking, her hands clasped tightly.
"You have never seen me angry before.
She knew there would be no use in trying to conceal the truth, and she was not in the mood to make the effort.
She walked very fast, after she left the house.
"I don't want to be cool," she said.
And I am not afraid of her at all.
"How did you guess?" she exclaimed.
She scarcely knew herself.
Do you wonder that it took even Lady Theobald a long time to say that?"
"Let me go to her.
But he drew her gently with him; and a few steps took them into the shade of the young oaks and pines, and there he paused.
Burmistone!"
He was an acrid, dictatorial old man: he contradicted Lady Theobald flatly every five minutes, and bullied his man servant.
"What are you going to say to her?" he asked.
never!"
Is it enough?"
She laughed again.
"Never!
"Oh, it is!
"He has a great deal of money.
"mr Burmistone!" she said: "mr
"I am going to ask her what she means.
Grandmamma"--She stopped short, and colored, and drew her slight figure up.
"I am glad I came here," she said, at length.
This is my blessing!'
As he did so he started back. It was not the same girl.
As you are so generously taking her on trust, may she never cause you a moment's regret.
"In his anger, he cursed me, saying: 'O wicked one, for this offence you are condemned to be changed into a piece of unconscious metal.'
How is it possible that the princess should have fallen in love with such a paltry wretch, overlooking a man like me?
One day, as I was flying through the air, wearing a white dress, a swan, mistaking me for a lotus flower, attacked me.
The attendants in the adjoining apartments, hearing the scream, thought something dreadful must have happened.
"You have, in consequence, suffered all this misery.
She humbly bowing down said: "Let my lord pardon his servant for the injury which she has unconsciously caused.
"Having made himself invisible, he entered without difficulty the apartment of the princess, and was astonished and enraged on finding her lying in your arms.
I am an Apsaras, born from the rays of the moon.
A terrible battle ensued, in which both kings performed prodigies of valour.
Treated thus like some wild beast, roughly shaken and neglected, Rajavahana would have suffered greatly had he not been protected by the magic jewel given to him in Patala, and which he had contrived to conceal in his hair.
On his way he saw the silver fetter, descended to the ground, picked it up, and continued his flight.
They rushed into the room, added their cries to hers, and forgetting all their former precautions, left the doors open, so that the guards outside, hearing the clamour, entered and saw the prince.
Thus the princess, listening with delight and astonishment to the sweet and eloquent words of her husband, and he never tired of contemplating her beauty and enjoying her caresses, lived for some time in the greatest happiness, without care or anxiety for the future.
She is a disgrace to her family, and shall soon see her husband impaled on a stake."
Sinhavarma, being of a very impatient and impetuous disposition, would not wait for the arrival of the allies who had been summoned to his assistance, and were then on the march; but throwing open the gates, went forth to meet the enemy.
Have ready, also, a fierce elephant, suitably equipped, which I shall mount immediately after the wedding, to overtake my army in march against the enemy; and as I set out, I will make the elephant trample the life out of that criminal."
"Oh, how do you do, mr Strong?" and he ran to meet the head teacher.
She didn't seem to mind it."
mrs Green did not speak to him for almost a week after that.
Oh, dear, you never did anything, never!" And mrs Green shook her head warningly.
"Why, nothing, Aleck, my boy.
"There you are," said Sam at last.
"Oh, my!
"Raise you right hand to your breast, just as all statesmen do.
"Indeed.
"Oh, I'm going in for study this session," answered Tom demurely. And then he winked at Larry on the sly.
But his words did not deceive George Strong, who understood only too well Tom's propensity for mischief.
"To be sure.
"Now stand still and I'll take a snap shot."
"Not at all.
"What was her trouble, Tom-consumption?"
"Splendid, sir," said Tom.
And yet with it all she couldn't help but like the boy.
"I don't see any picture," growled Snuggers, looking at the square blankly.
"How are you-pretty well?
"How about it?" And his eyes twinkled.
I've gained fifteen pounds, and-"
I'm first rate, never was better in my life!" And he gave the hand a hard squeeze.
"I didn't mean it-really I didn't.
"mrs Green, when you die, they ought to erect an awfully big monument over your grave."
"I-I don't know!" sobbed Tom.
"So you've come back, have you?" observed mrs Green, as Tom stopped at the kitchen door.
"It's really like home," he murmured presently.
"Now wait a minute and the picture will be finished."
"Have you got a camera?"
It's just out of the oven."
To have a photograph taken for nothing tickled him greatly.
"Hullo, Aleck!" cried Tom rushing up and grabbing the colored man by the hand.
The idol Virabudra is carried to a mantapam outside the town, and placed on the ground.
As long as the god remains in the mantapam, the scorpions do not sting, but, directly he leaves it, they resume their poisonous propensities.
The excrement of lizards fed on scorpions, and the undigested food in the stomach of a freshly killed goat, dried and reduced to powder, are also believed to be effective remedies.
The root should be collected on a new moon day which falls on a Sunday.
On that day, the Sakuna Pakshi bathes, cuts off his loin cloth, and goes stark naked to a selected spot, where he gathers the roots.
Some families keep in their homes small pots called thelkodukku undi (scorpion sting vessels), and occasionally drop therein a copper coin, which is supposed to secure immunity against scorpion sting.
It is generally supposed that no scorpion can live in this village, and that the sacred ashes from Sattandi Amman's shrine are a specific for scorpion stings.
The village goddess at Nangavaram in the Trichinopoly district is called Sattandi Amman, and her idol represents her in the act of weaving a garland of scorpions.
"Who, then?"
She will tell you nothing ill of herself, of course.
"I have too much to say."
"I tell you I love Louise to distraction."
The cunning captain was quite right in his suspicions; for as soon as Montalais entered she exclaimed, "Oh, monsieur!
"I never mix myself up in affairs of that kind; you know that very well."
Very fine, indeed!
Of course I should go about all day, saying, 'Ah! what a fine stupid fellow that Bragelonne was! as great a stupid as I ever met with.
I begin to believe there is fire when I see smoke.
Why, you see, Raoul, if I had an idea,--but I have not got one."
"How very fortunate that is; he was looking for you, too.
the portrait-"
"I am, indeed; and you know the reason very well, Monsieur d'Artagnan."
Raoul buried his face in his hands, murmuring: "No, no; I have not a single friend in the world."
How much I should regret you!
"No, it is not from curiosity, it is from love."
Another big word.
"What the deuce is the matter that you look as you do, and what makes you so dumb?" said the captain.
And a fine affair that would be.
I have passed my whole life almost in teaching him how to hold and use his sword properly, and the silly fellow has got himself spitted like a lark.' Go, then, Raoul, go and get yourself disposed of, if you like.
I should quarrel with you.
"Who is that?"
Raoul was already pale enough; and he now began to turn his hat round and round in his hand.
"A woman."
I have neither head nor arm; do not despise, but help me.
"It will kill me!" he said.
"Ah!" she said, in the same tone of voice, "it is not I who am going to speak to him."
"It is Madame who has sent for him."
So be off."
"Do people nowadays assume that sort of airs in England?
"Every one."
I hardly know who can have taught you logic, but deuce take me if your father has not been regularly robbed of his money."
But you ask me all sorts of questions, and I answer you.
You distress me, you do, indeed.
D'Artagnan increased the sharpness of his penetrating gaze, which no secret was capable of resisting.
"She is deceiving you," said D'Artagnan, not a muscle of whose face had moved; "those are big words.
"Of course.
"What! not for a friend, for a son!"
Wait, if you can."
You wish to be consoled by some one, and you will be so at once.
"Oh! try, try."
So much the better.
Raoul struck his forehead with his hand in utter despair.
"Well, I admit it.
"You are unhappy about something," he said.
"So much the worse.
Nay, do not pretend to be astonished."
"There, there now."
You would listen to me, but you would not hear me!
monsieur!
I have been in England, and came here again as lively as a chaffinch.
Who makes use of them?"
"You are mistaken, monsieur," replied Raoul; "the woman I mean will tell me all the evil she possibly can."
I do not understand that at all."
"I do not suppose it will concern you.
"I have told you for the last hour that I know nothing of the whole affair."
"Idle fancies, monsieur.
you would hear, but you would not understand me; you would understand, but you would not obey me."
"I cannot."
"To me?" murmured D'Artagnan.
"Well! suppose it were only that?"
"What do you mean?"
"Good.
I beg your pardon, Monsieur d'Artagnan."
"Forgive me, my dear friend, I was going to ask you that."
What should I care?
"I am not pretending to be astonished, my friend."
In two words, I am the most wretched of living beings."
"Oh! yes, indeed, in order that you may get deeper into the mire!
"Exactly.
How is Porthos, do you know?"
that the king has not recalled you, and you have returned?
"Ah! if every one says so, there must be some truth in it.
"Yes, yes! you now assume a different tone: instead of killing, you will get killed yourself, I suppose you mean?
"Indeed, yes."
It is exactly like a man with a toothache, who keeps on saying, 'Oh! what torture I am suffering.
I forgive you, mademoiselle," said D'Artagnan; "I know that, at my age, those who are looking for me generally need me for something or another."
The captain, sitting buried in his leathern armchair, his spurs fixed in the floor, his sword between his legs, was reading a number of letters, as he twisted his mustache.
"A carpenter! what do you mean?"
"No sensible man ever succeeded in making much of a brain when the head was turned.
I have completely lost my senses in the same way a hundred times in my life.
"Oh! certainly."
"So you have said already."
"To look for some one who will tell me the truth."
Even if I were unfortunate enough to know something, and foolish enough to communicate it to you-You are my friend, you say?"
"I go far.
D'Artagnan could read to the very bottom of the young man's heart.
Bragelonne Continues His Inquiries.
Saint Aignan Follows Malicorne's Advice.
"I am here, dear Louise," said Raoul, running towards her.
But the door remained closed, and neither Saint Aignan nor the painter appeared, nor did the hangings even move.
Suddenly, a noise upon the upper floor was heard, which had, in fact, continued, though it had remained unnoticed, for some time; it had at last aroused La Valliere's attention, though but slowly so.
"Quick, quick!
And again, when the artist, following Malicorne's advice, was a little late in arriving, and when Saint Aignan had been obliged to be absent for some time, it was interesting to observe, though no one witnessed them, those moments of silence full of deep expression, which united in one sigh two souls most disposed to understand each other, and who by no means objected to the quiet meditation they enjoyed together.
"Go then, dearest love," said the king, "but return quickly."
"I knew but too well that you had not ceased to love me."
But suddenly the king, who had heard Louise's exclamation, darted through the opening, and hurried forward to her assistance.
But she gently shook her head, as she replied: "Happiness hidden... power concealed... my pride should be as silent as my heart."
Saint Aignan was not within, when La Valliere, who was now quite familiar with the lower story, lifted up the trap door and descended.
The king was less reserved, and exhibited his annoyance by a very significant shrug of the shoulders, at which La Valliere could not help blushing.
In a word, Malicorne, philosopher that he was, though he knew it not, had learned how to inspire the king with an appetite in the midst of plenty, and with desire in the assurance of possession.
Chapter thirty nine.
Malicorne will be delighted this evening;" as he, in fact, was, when it was reported to him.
"Some one is waiting for me above.
"My Aunt Adella gave me-gave us-the material," she stammered.
Will you tell me where you got the silk of which your waist is made?"
When I saw your dress, I felt sure you were related to her.
She thought it a wonderful bit of good luck that Penelope went out each of the evenings to study some especially difficult problems with a school chum.
That pucker came often enough without being brought there by extra worries.
She is such a darling sister.
This was long ago, you know, when travelling and correspondence were not the easy, matter of course things they are now.
I declare, it is as good as new."
"She looks as if she had just stepped out of the frame of some lovely old picture," she said to herself.
"Well, let us go and have tea," said Penelope.
"You must come and see Doris.
Tell me, Dorrie, does it argue a lack of proper respect for my ancestors that I can't feel very enthusiastic over this heirloom-especially when Grandmother Hunter died years before I was born?"
Penelope has studied so hard all winter and she hasn't gone anywhere, thought the older sister wistfully.
"Then you are my grandniece," she said.
Penelope Saverne was the daughter of my mother by her first husband.
"I wish I could think of some way to get you a new waist," said Doris, with what these sisters called "the poverty pucker" coming in the centre of her pretty forehead.
If it could only be managed!
Penelope was seventeen, and when one is seventeen and cannot go to a party because one hasn't a suitable dress to wear, the world is very apt to seem a howling wilderness.
Penelope thought her altogether charming.
"It will be such a nice surprise for her," the sister mused jubilantly.
Doris dreamed of pretty dresses all that night and thought about them all the next day.
Isn't it all wonderful, Doris Hunter?"
"I'd better be putting my grey matter into that algebra instead of wasting it plotting for a party dress that I certainly can't get.
The expressman brought this parcel an hour ago, and there's a letter for you from Aunt Adella on the clock shelf, and I think they belong to each other.
There is a bit of the wedding dress of every member of the family in it.
Oddly enough, our birthdays fell on the same day, and when Penelope was twenty and I sixteen, my father gave us each a silk dress of this very material.
So, it must be confessed, did Penelope, though she would not have admitted it for the world.
"Penelope Saverne.
"I really don't think my curiosity could have borne the strain for another five minutes.
She is getting discouraged over those examinations and she needs just a good, jolly time to hearten her up.
Now she patted mrs Fairweather's soft old hand affectionately.
"Listen, Penelope."
Music for you-somebody to pet and fuss over for me-and such a dear, sweet aunty for us both!"
Next year it would be easier if Penelope got through her examinations successfully, but just now there was absolutely not a spare penny.
I think the silk once belonged to my Grandmother Hunter."
"She died six years ago, and I have been so lonely since."
I will tell you the whole truth-I don't mind it now.
I am named after her."
So I am disposing of such of the family heirlooms as I do not wish to take with me.
"But it was very fortunate that you did it for once, sister mine.
My dear, I am a very lonely old woman, with nobody belonging to me.
"You must take the place of my own dear little granddaughter," said Aunt esther.
"Why, the wrong side is ever so much prettier than the right!" exclaimed Penelope.
The pattern is what they call 'Little Thousands,' isn't it?
"It is hard to be poor.
"Is it-it isn't-yes, it is!
Penelope was four years older than I was, but we were devoted to each other.
I married out West and have lived there all my life.
mrs Fairweather, who was visiting mrs Anderson, looked closely at it also.
Come now, Dorrie dear, smooth that pucker out.
"What lovely, old timey stuff!
She wanted Penelope to go to that party.
It gives one a nice, important family feeling."
Poor Penelope's pretty young face turned crimson.
But Doris did not see how it could.
Doris Hunter, I believe it's an old quilt!"
A little later on the knowledge came to her suddenly, and she thought with inward surprise: Why, it is Doris, of course.
"It may have been pretty once, but it is all faded now.
"Doris Hunter, you are a veritable little witch!
It took your grandmother five years to make it.
When mrs Fairweather had gone, Doris and Penelope looked at each other.
It's a sad thing for a body to lack brains when she wants to be a teacher, isn't it?
"I wish she belonged to me.
I have mine yet.
Indeed, she could not have done even that much if they had not owned their little cottage.
If I could only absorb algebra and history as I can music, what a blessing it would be!
"Well, there is no use sitting here sighing for the unattainable," she said, jumping up briskly.
You don't know how delighted I am to find that I have two grandnieces."
It is something to possess an heirloom, after all.
When Doris reached home the next evening, she found Penelope hovering over a bulky parcel on the sitting room table.
She laughed a little shakily.
"Oh, very," agreed Penelope drolly.
"If your black skirt were sponged and pressed and re hung, it would do very well."
Hurry up and find out.
mrs Fairweather did go to see Doris the very next day, and quite wonderful things came to pass from that interview.
"It sounds like a storybook," she said gaily.
The lining was certainly very pretty.
Doris and Penelope found their lives and plans changed in the twinkling of an eye.
I never knew what had become of Penelope.
She knew that Penelope had started out to say "a new dress." She cut the strings and removed the wrappings.
Every morning when I awaken the new day seems to me to be a good fairy who will bring me some beautiful gift of joy.
"I want to run over and see how mrs Brixby is this evening, Siddy, and you must take care of the baby till I get back."
"It is the name of mr Conway's estate-mr
I had a great deal more to say-about your letter, your big "round up" and your tribulations with your Chinese cook-but I've only time now to say goodbye.
"Oh, Jim Conway's place!" said Caleb.
It is six years since I was home, and it seems like three times six.
There was nothing sentimental, hinted at or implied, in the correspondence.
She was a big shapeless woman with a round good-natured face-cheerful and vulgar as a sunflower was Aunt Jane at all times and occasions.
One such request went from Sidney under the pen name of "Ellen Douglas." The girl was lonely in Plainfield; she had no companions or associates such as she cared for; the Maple Leaf Club represented all that her life held of outward interest, and she longed for something more.
He had been all over the world, and had seen everything everybody else had seen and everything they hadn't too, I think.
What should she do?
I found it so fascinating, too!
"I am."
He felt that she was frightened and in trouble, and he wanted to comfort and reassure her.
You can't mistake it."
Sidney refused to lie around and take it easy.
All the eastern Heaven was abloom with it.
As it was, I had contradicted him twice, and he had laughed and liked it.
"I am looking for the house of mr james Conway-'The Evergreens.' Can you direct me to it?"
Just beyond was another home-made gate of poles.
And as a result I mean to stay a week at Plainfield and come to see you every day, if you will let me.
"Then why did you write them?" he asked blankly.
Oh, please go away and forgive me if you can!
He talked of books and music, of art and travel.
All her days were alike as far as hard work and dullness went, but she accepted them cheerfully and uncomplainingly.
Since then they had written to each other regularly.
I shall go by the c p r, which passes through Plainfield, and I mean to stop off for a day.
Some days later a young man stepped from the c p r train at Plainfield station and found his way to the one small hotel the place boasted.
"Can you be Sidney Richmond-the Sidney Richmond who has written to me for four years?"
I had a delightful run away.
She never expected to meet john Lincoln, nor did she wish to do so.
Had the hotel keeper made a mistake?
And when once I had begun, I had to keep it up.
Presently he found himself before the blacksmith's forge.
You will let me call and see you, won't you?
"Why did you deceive me?"
This is my home.
"Then, those letters-"
Sidney hated that mirror as virulently as she could hate anything.
Sidney sighed and went downstairs for the baby.
But his books will always have a new meaning to me henceforth, through the insight he himself has given me.
Then home and to dinner.
Refuse to see him?
Jim Conway's house is just this side of it on the right-back from the road a smart piece and no other handy.
"I don't understand," said john Lincoln again.
Often a letter concluded with a request to the club members to correspond with the writer.
I love life so much for giving me such a friendship!
He was two years out from the east, and had not yet forgotten to be homesick at times.
It was worse than she had even thought it would be.
No, no, never!
He passed down the lane and over the little rustic bridge that spanned the brook.
After all, those letters were true-or, rather, there was truth in them.
A Correspondence and A Climax
He wrote:
We are poor. Everything I told you about it and my life was just imagination."
"That is the soul of music with all its sense and earthliness refined away."
On my way home after the Braddon people had left us somebody asked me how I liked Paul Moore!
james Conway," explained john Lincoln.
You revealed yourself more faithfully in them than if you had written truly about your narrow outward life."
She got out her box of paper and sat down by the little table at the window with a small kerosene lamp at her elbow.
She is to me mother and sister and wise, clear sighted friend.
"I don't understand," he said perplexedly.
"Don't do much today, Siddy," she said kindly.
"Please don't distress yourself so, Sidney," he said, unconsciously using her Christian name.
He never had done so, but "Ellen Douglas's" letter was so interesting that he had decided to write to her.
"There was nothing true in them-nothing at all.
After getting his supper he asked the proprietor if he could direct him to "The Evergreens."
This monthly letter was the only pleasure and stimulant in her life.
It never would have occurred to her to protest or be petulant about it.
It seemed to her to typify all that was unlovely in her life.
But he would find out the truth just the same; she would lose his friendships and respect just as surely.
"Just lie around and take it easy till you get rested up.
I'm not such a dull fellow as you take me for.
The gift she gave me today was my sunset gallop on my grey mare Lady.
At sunset Sidney hurried to her room to take off the soiled and faded cotton dress she had worn while milking.
This young man was certainly good at understanding.
Those letters made that other life seem real to me.
I enjoy every one of them, every minute of them.
She has sympathy and understanding for my every mood.
john Lincoln's letter was short, but the pertinent paragraph of it burned itself into Sidney's brain.
Perhaps he had meant some other james Conway.
I seemed to be looking into an enchanted mirror where all my own dreams and ideals were reflected back to me, but made, oh, so much more beautiful!
"This is his place-nobody calls it 'The Evergreens' but myself.
He wrote that, although his age debarred him from membership in the club (he was twenty, and the limit was eighteen), he read the letters of the department with much interest, and often had thought of answering some of the requests for correspondents.
I just couldn't write you about my life here, not because it was hard, but it was so ugly and empty.
I met another clever man a few evenings ago.
The very best letter I can write in the half hour before the carriage will be at the door to take me to mrs Braddon's dance shall be yours tonight.
"Yes, if there is anything to forgive.
Yours sincerely, Sidney Richmond.
You will be weary of my rhapsodies over her.
And there was no harbour or glimpse of distant sea visible.
I hadn't thought about him before-I hadn't even caught his name in the general introduction.
I am going east for a visit.
"Were all lies," said Sidney bluntly and desperately.
It was a page given over to youthful Canadians and filled with their contributions in the way of letters, verses, and prize essays.
She was afraid the child was "taking something."
I should have come this evening and spent an hour or so with you, and then have gone away on the train tomorrow morning, and that would have been all.
A lot of us went for a sail on the harbour.
I am Sidney Richmond."
These last four days since your letter came have been dreadful to me.
On my right was the harbour, silvered over with a rising moon.
He is not above talking delightful nonsense even to a girl.
I wanted to ride on so forever, straight into the heart of the sunset.
But she did resent having to look after the baby when she wanted to write her letter.
Dear mr Lincoln:
Beside it was a rickety, unpainted gate opening into a snake fenced lane feathered here and there with scrubby little spruces.
"I think I do understand.
As she slipped into her blue print afternoon dress her aunt called to her from below.
Four years before, when Sidney was sixteen, still calling herself a schoolgirl by reason of the fact that she could be spared to attend school four months in the winter when work was slack, she had been much interested in the "Maple Leaf" department of the Montreal weekly her uncle took.
The man I had been talking with was Paul Moore, the great novelist!
I never expected to meet you.
john Lincoln opened the gate and went up to her.
I love life and its bloom and brilliancy; I love meeting new people; I love the ripple of music, the hum of laughter and conversation.
"You-you'll forgive me then?" she stammered.
Below in the kitchen there was a hubbub of laughing, crying, quarrelling children, and a reek of bad tobacco smoke drifted up to the girl's disgusted nostrils.
And for my own part, I am glad you are not what I have always thought you were.
Any day, any hour, might bring john Lincoln to Plainfield.
So I wrote instead of the life I wanted to live-the life I did live in imagination.
In the correspondence itself she found her pleasure.
Every word she uttered only increased my admiration of the noble creature whom I had loved, and lost.
"Pride?" she repeated.
When my interference had restored my unworthy rival to his freedom, could I submit to the degrading necessity of seeing her in his presence, of speaking to her under his eyes?
If he can pay a dividend to his creditors, they will give him his freedom; and he believes he can raise the money if I consent to insure my life."
"Kiss me," she whispered, "before you go!
It is only your goodness that overpowers me."
They are trustworthy and experienced men, and I am sure they can be of use to you."
I pressed her to my heart, with the unacknowledged tenderness of a parting embrace.
Unhappily, he returned to tell me of his good fortune, and the same day he was arrested for debt.
"Why need you hesitate?
"Does speaking of him again mean speaking of his debts?" I asked.
"I am very unfortunate; I seem to have innocently disturbed and annoyed you for the second time."
"Complete the good work that you have begun," she answered, gratefully. "Help me back to health.
"Your help?" I exclaimed.
"You are quite mistaken," I replied.
"You have forgiven me," I said.
Hopeless infatuation!
The woman (in my situation) must be heartless indeed who could destroy your place in the estimation of the world and the regard of your friends!
Cautiously as I had expressed myself, her delicacy took the alarm.
The snare that had been set for her was plainly revealed in those four words.
Is it the wrong I suffered when Van Brandt married me, with a wife living at the time (and living still)?
The wretchedest creature that walks the streets would shrink from treating you in that way.
Never!
This is his position, in two words: A little while since, he obtained an excellent offer of employment abroad, from a rich relative of his, and he had made all his arrangements to accept it.
A helpless woman, with a mock husband in prison for debt!
His relative has offered to keep the situation open for a certain time, and the time has not yet expired.
"I hardly know how to tell you," she said, "without speaking again of mr Van Brandt."
I don't deny it; I don't excuse it-hopeless infatuation!
She put her hand on my mouth, and stopped me before I could say any more.
It is something to be your only friend.
And you talk of my being your wife-knowing that!"
Are you aware of the delays that are likely to take place before it will be possible to borrow money on your policy of insurance?"
"I am only doubting whether your plan for relieving mr Van Brandt of his embarrassments is quite so simple as you suppose.
Am I to marry you for my food and shelter?
Knowing what I knew of him-believing him, as I did, to be capable of any atrocity-I trembled at the bare idea of what might have happened if I had failed to find my way back to her until a later date. Thanks to the happy accident of my position, the one certain way of protecting her lay easily within my reach.
My manhood had sustained me through the parting with the mother.
You must have plans for the future; tell me unreservedly how I can help you."
"Yes.
Make me strong enough to submit to a doctor's estimate of my chances of living for some years yet."
Bitterly as I hated the man who had parted us, I loved her dearly enough to be even capable of helping him for her sake.
"My prospect of being married still rests with you."
"Oh! do you think I would let you give your money to Van Brandt?" she asked, as soon as she could speak.
"In such a position as mine?
"You know-to my shame I confessed it to you the last time we met-you know that my heart, in secret, is all yours.
My only friend, is it possible that you think me ungrateful enough to consent to be your wife?
Even this negative defense of Van Brandt stung me to the quick.
She looked at me for a moment, in silent distress.
"You have said nothing to me about yourself," she began.
It was impossible to disguise the position in which I had now placed myself.
To insure her life!
Let me tell you the plain truth.
"I cannot honestly say that it is," I answered.
What 'wrong' are you talking of?
And don't mind my crying.
Do you think I can ever forget the great misfortune of my life-the misfortune that has made me unworthy of you?
I rose to go, while my resolution still sustained me.
"A doctor's estimate of your chances of living?" I repeated.
"I know nothing about it," she said, sadly.
She rose, as I rose-with the tears in her eyes, and the blush on her cheeks.
What was there to prevent her from insuring her life, if she pleased, and from so disposing of the insurance as to give Van Brandt a direct interest in her death?
There is a serious necessity for his getting out of prison.
"Is your life a happier one than it was when we last met?"
"For the last time!" I thought, as I held her to me for a moment longer-"for the last time!"
"Is there any prospect of your being married?"
"He left me the little money he had with him when he was arrested," she rejoined, sadly.
"Let me deserve to be forgiven.
"Don't say that!" she exclaimed, with an entreating look at me.
"I ought to have spoken more guardedly of him," I said, bitterly.
I yielded---and spoke of it no more.
"How can you speak so cruelly to me?" she asked.
"Don't spoil my pleasure in seeing you again by speaking of what can never be! Have you still to be told how it is that you find me here alone with my child?"
"Promise that you won't ask me to borrow money of you for mr Van Brandt," she rejoined, "and I will accept your help gratefully."
It is no fault of mine, God knows; but it is not the less true that I am not married, and that the little darling who is playing out there with her doll is my child.
My one chance of saving her lay in keeping from her knowledge the course that I had now determined to pursue.
"The child accepts me as her second father," I said.
"What do you mean?"
"Will you let me ask the advice of my lawyers?
LOVE AND MONEY.
FEELING the embarrassment of the moment most painfully on her side, mrs Van Brandt spoke first.
I could honestly promise that.
I had, so to speak, pronounced my own sentence of banishment.
It was only when the child's round, innocent little face laid itself lovingly against mine that my fortitude gave way.
In the eye of the law she was, of course, a single woman: she was of age; she was, to all intents and purposes, her own mistress.
There have been few god saviors who did not have twelve apostles or messengers.
And who can number the bitter disappointments caused by such impossible promises?
There has been considerable confusion and contradiction about it.
How, then, are we to decide which of the numerous candidates for divine honors should be given our votes?
The theologian might say that this little difficulty was introduced purposely into the scriptures to establish its infallibility, but it is only religious books that are pronounced infallible on the strength of the contradictions they contain.
But he said: "If ye ask anything in my name, I will do it," and "If it were not so, I would have told you." Did he not mean just what he said?
The Gospels give no date, and appear to be quite uncertain-really ignorant about it.
And such a faith is never free, it is always maintained by the sword now, and by hell fire hereafter.
Who were john, peter, Judas, and Mary?
Again, many of the contemporaries of Lincoln bear written witness to his existence.
Instead of producing historical evidence or appealing to creditable documents, as one would to prove the existence of a Caesar or an Alexander, Justin Martyr draws upon pagan mythology in his reply to the critics of Christianity.
If that is what he meant, why did he say something else?
To help their cause the Christian apologists not infrequently also changed the sense of certain Old Testament passages to make them support the miraculous stories in the New Testament.
peter, Paul, john, james, Judas, occupy the stage almost exclusively.
The number twelve, like the number seven, or three, or forty, plays an important role in all Sun myths, and points to the twelve signs of the Zodiac.
The belief that the stars determine human destinies is a very ancient one.
They must be true because they are the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies.
Then why is there discontent in the world?
Hence, if the shepherds sleeping in the fields really saw the heavens open and heard the angel song, in all probability it was in some other month of the year, and not late in December.
Why this discrepancy in a historical document, to say nothing about inspiration?
That Lincoln was President of these United States, that he signed the Emancipation Proclamation, and that he was assassinated, can be readily authenticated.
Let me now give an idea of the method I propose to follow in the study of this subject.
Let us suppose that a student living in the year three thousand desired to make sure that such a man as Abraham Lincoln really lived and did the things attributed to him.
And he was unknown to them because no such Jesus existed in their day.
The uncertainty about the apostles of Jesus is quite in keeping with the uncertainty about Jesus himself.
There could not be a more damaging admission than this from one of the most conspicuous defenders of Jesus' story against early criticism.
Neither the place nor the time of Jesus' birth is known.
"It never struck me," continues mr Holyoake, "that the preacher's threadbare dress, his half famished look, and necessity of taking up a collection the previous night to pay expenses showed that faith was not a source of income to him.
Can the followers of Jesus move mountains, drink deadly poisons, touch serpents, or work greater miracles than are ascribed to Jesus, as it was promised that they would do?
Jesus may have claimed to have been a God, but is every one who puts forth such a claim a God?
Jesus may have been a wonderful man, but is every wonderful man a God?
If Jesus is not real, says Origin, then Apollo was not real, and the Old Testament prophecies have not been fulfilled.
This uncertainty robs the story of Jesus, to an extent at least, of the atmosphere of reality.
They write history, not stories.
This is so important that we refer our readers to Origin's own words on the subject.
Have these prayers been answered?
Let us continue: Abraham Lincoln's associates and contemporaries are all known to history.
In other words, the only proofs Origin can bring forth against the rationalistic criticism of Celsus is, that to deny Jesus would be equivalent to denying both the Pagan and Jewish mythologies.
There is absolutely no evidence that they ever existed.
Of course, there are in history great men of whose birthplaces or birthdays we are equally uncertain.
The report that Jesus had twelve apostles seems also mythical.
All he seems to ask for is that Jesus be given a higher place among the divinities of the ancient world.
But in the absence of evidence Origin offers the following metaphysical arguments against the sceptical Celsus: one.
That is precisely our position.
Who was matthew?
But let us continue.
Yet there is no evidence that he was born on that day.
It cannot be proved that the twenty fifth of December is his birthday.
One day he went to see the Rev.
It is impossible to explain why the contemporaries of Jesus, the authors and historians of his time, do not take notice of him.
The twenty fifth of December is celebrated as his birthday.
The report that Jesus was God is equally impossible of verification. How are we to prove whether or not a certain person was God?
It snows in Palestine, though a warmer country, and we know that in December there are no shepherds tending their flocks in the night time in that country.
Seventy wise men are supposed to have translated the Old Testament, sitting in seventy different cells.
How many self deluded prophets these extravagant claims have produced!
Observe to what confusion the mere attempt to follow such a report leads us.
In many of the religions of the world, the number twelve is sacred.
If we are to have any mythology at all, he seems to argue, why object to adding to it the mythus of Jesus?
How weak must be one's case to resort to such tactics in order to command a following!
The biographers of Lincoln or of Socrates do not seem to be interested in numbers.
"Do you really believe," asked young Holyoake to the clergyman, "that what we ask in faith we shall receive?"
There has never been any unanimity about this matter.
If Paul was an apostle, we have fourteen, instead of twelve.
When we come to the more important chapters about Jesus, we meet with greater difficulties.
Such expressions in our language as "ill starred," "a lucky star," "disaster," "lunacy," and so on, indicate the hold which astrology once enjoyed upon the human mind.
Here again we see the presence of a myth.
If peter ever went to Rome with a new doctrine, how is it that no historian has taken note of him?
He was the only one who saw them.
They are not mentioned except in the New Testament books, which, as we shall see, are "supposed" copies of "supposed" originals.
Again, matthew says that to escape the evil designs of Herod, Mary and Joseph, with the infant Jesus, fled into Egypt, luke says nothing about this hurried flight, nor of Herod's intention to kill the infant Messiah.
But the more fervently she prayed the heavier grew the burden of her life.
This ancient Sun myth is the starting point of nearly all miraculous religions, from the days of Egypt to the twentieth century.
Leaving out Judas, and counting Matthias, who was elected in his place, we have thirteen apostles.
Moreover, if Jesus could keep his promise, there would be today no misery in the world, no orphans, no childless mothers, no shipwrecks, no floods, no famines, no disease, no crippled children, no insanity, no wars, no crime, no wrong!
Yet not only is the date of his birth a matter of conjecture, but also the year in which he was born.
A man must have a birthplace and a birthday.
The number forty figures also in many primitive myths.
Have not a thousand, thousand prayers been offered in Jesus' name against every evil which has ploughed the face of our earth?
A stone or wooden idol could not have been more indifferent to a mother's tears.
In one or two places, in the New Testament, Jesus is made to send out "the seventy" to evangelize the world.
George Jacob Holyoake, of England, tells how in the days of utter poverty, his believing mother asked the Lord, again and again-on her knees, with tears streaming from her eyes, and with absolute faith in Jesus' ability to keep His promise,--to give her starving children their daily bread.
The immediate companions of Jesus appear to be, on the other hand, as mythical as he is himself.
"No, no," he replied, raising his hand to command silence, "Apollo is not a god; he was only an idol."
It was Sunday-Sunday before Christmas, and the people were going to "the House of God."
I am not denying," I said, "that Jesus ever lived.
But my guide placed his hand quickly upon my shoulder, and held me back.
Have you seen Apollo?
"It had only one fault," interrupted my guide.
"No," I said, in a low voice.
"It was not true."
"Do you doubt Homer?" I said to him; "Homer, the inspired bard?
I, who had never seen a god, never touched one, never heard one speak, I who had believed in Apollo without ever having known anything provable about him, I wanted to see the real God, Jesus.
"A priest of Apollo?" I interrogated.
By this time we stood at the entrance of a large edifice which my guide said was "the House of God." As we walked in I saw innumerable little lights blinking and winking all over the spacious interior. There were, besides, pictures, altars and images all around me.
"This must be a day of festival and worship, devoted to one of their gods," I murmured to myself.
"Forget Apollo," he said, with a suggestion of severity in his voice. "There is no such person.
"I want to see Jesus," I hastened, turning toward him.
"Do you know of any one who has?"
"Of course you are going there, too," I said to my friendly guide.
The whole Greek world will bear me witness that I am telling the truth." Then I looked at my guide to see what impression this outburst of sincere enthusiasm had produced upon him, and I saw a cold smile upon his lips that cut me to the heart.
Have you touched him?"
"Would not that, then," I ventured to ask, impatiently, "make Jesus as much of an idol as Apollo?
"But many of us Greeks," I said, "have felt Apollo in our hearts and have been inspired by him."
"Will he not be here this morning?
Homer, whose inkwell was as big as the sea; whose imperishable page was Time?
"Will he not permit them to touch him, to caress his hand, to clasp his divine feet, to inhale the ambrosial fragrance of his breath, to bask in the golden light of his eyes, to hear the music of his immaculate accents?
If you were to search for Apollo in all the universe you would never find any one answering to his name or description.
"Is he, then, dead?" I asked.
Then, taking heart, I told my guide how more than once I had felt Apollo's radiant presence in my heart, and told him of the immortal lines of Homer concerning the divine Apollo.
"An idol?" I whispered, taken by surprise.
Homer, whose every word was a drop of light?"
He was only an idol.
We gazed for a moment silently into each other's eyes.
I was too much surprised at this to make any immediate reply.
I accepted it gratefully.
When you cannot prove the existence of your god, when you have never seen him, nor heard his voice, nor touched him-when you have nothing provable about him, he is an idol.
The audience was upon its knees enveloped in silence-a silence so solemn that it awed me.
Jesus," he resumed, "is the Son of God.
"He never lived; and for the last two thousand years or more his temple has been a heap of ruins."
"But I still believe in Apollo," I exclaimed; "he is not dead, I know he is alive."
"Prove it," he said to me; then, pausing for a moment, "if you produce him," he said, "we shall all fall down and worship him.
I have been dead for nearly as many years.
I clasped his hand.
"He was an idol, then, and not a god."
PART one
He must have realized I was a stranger and wished to tender his hospitality to me.
Produce Apollo and he shall be our god."
He came to our earth and was born of a virgin."
Have you heard him?
"What was that?" I inquired, without knowing what his answer would be.
No, no, Apollo is not an idol.
He understood my bewilderment amid my novel surroundings, and offered to enlighten me.
They built temples to divinities which were merely empty names-empty names," he repeated.
And, if faith that Jesus is a god proves him a god, why will not faith in Apollo make him a god?
"What blasphemy!"
"Yes," he answered, "I conduct the worship.
Will he not speak to his worshippers?" I asked again.
He pressed mine.
I am a priest."
"Is it possible," I asked, "that all this is pure fabrication, a fantasy of the brain, as unsubstantial as the air?
Let me, too, see Jesus," I pleaded.
"No," he answered.
I am today twenty five hundred years old.
"Produce him!" I whispered to myself.
Observing my anxiety to understand the meaning of all this, my guide took me aside and in a whisper told me that the people were celebrating the anniversary of the birthday of their beautiful Savior-Jesus, the Son of God.
A PARABLE
Again I was tempted to tell my guide that that was how Apollo became incarnate; but I restrained myself.
They worshipped gods that did not exist.
Looking about me I saw a gentleman in a neat black dress, smiling, and his hand extended to me with great cordiality.
It will be seen from these examples that there is no harm in myth making if the myth is called a myth.
My only protection is to be rational-to be truthful.
The multitude is ever joined to its idols; let them alone.
It is, then, as we grow older, and, if I may use the word, riper, that we learn to distinguish between fact and fiction, between history and myth.
IS JESUS A MYTH?
He can also invoke the authority of the church and of the Christian world to enforce acceptance of his teaching.
I know there are those who wish they could always remain children,--living in dreamland.
It was with the human race in its infancy as it is with the child.
We can afford to be independent.
Religion is the science of the child.
In the discussion of this subject, I appeal to the mature, not to the child mind.
In all probability, they argue, there was a man called Jesus, who said many helpful things, and led an exemplary life, and all the miracles and wonders represent the accretions of fond and pious ages.
Before the days of science, a fanciful answer was all that could be given to man's questions about the physical world.
He is God's mouthpiece, and no one may disagree with him.
The mind craves for knowledge.
But even if this were desirable, it is not possible. Evolution is our destiny; of what use is it, then, to take up arms against destiny?
This was natural.
What is a myth?
Our feet do not really begin to touch the firm ground until we have reached the years of discretion.
The latter can command a hearing in the name of God, or in the name of the Bible.
A myth, then, is a guess, a story, a speculation, or a fanciful explanation of a phenomenon, in the absence of accurate information.
The child's imagination is more active than its reason.
The only way I may command your respect is to be reasonable. You will not listen to me for God's sake, nor for the Bible's sake, nor yet for the love of heaven, or the fear of hell.
The primitive man guessed where knowledge failed him-what else could he do?
It thinks less than it guesses.
We fill the space about and over us with spirits, fairies, gods, and other invisible and airy beings.
Even the few who entertain doubts on the subject, seem to hold that while there is a large mythical element in the Jesus story, nevertheless there is a historical nucleus round which has clustered the elaborate legend of the Christ.
Myths die when history is born.
Observing the sun, the moon, and the stars overhead, the primitive man wished to account for them.
The school is the birthplace of science.
In other words, the preacher can afford to ignore common sense in the name of revelation. But if I depart from it in the least, or am caught once playing fast and loose with the facts, I will irretrievably lose my standing.
There is in man a faculty for fiction.
Science was born of that realization.
We covet the rainbow.
Is Jesus a myth?
Grown up people create science.
Now and then they came close enough to snap at each other.
And this is precisely the use to which myths have been put.
It is reflection which introduces a bit into the mouth of imagination, curbing its pace and subduing its restless spirit.
The child asks questions because of an inborn desire to know.
Man feels ill at ease with a sense of a mental vacuum, until his questions are answered.
In every sense, the subject is an all absorbing one.
This wild flight of fancy is checked only by experience.
Children make religions.
Let us place ourselves entirely in the hands of the evidence.
Science is the religion of the matured man.
There is in this thought a world of meaning.
The majority of writers assume that a person answering to the description of Jesus lived some two thousand years ago.
Science was not born until man had matured.
This was imaginary knowledge, which travel and research have corrected.
There is an important difference between a lecturer and an ordained preacher.
We reach out for the moon.
A myth is a fanciful explanation of a given phenomenon.
If I do not ask the gods to help us, it is because I believe in human help, so much more real than supernatural help.
If I do not believe in standing still, it is because I believe in progress.
Life, death, truth-behold, these three no power can keep back.
It is not true.
The world owes its emancipation to human daring.
Count your rights-political, religious, social, intellectual-and tell me which of them was conquered for you by the priest.
We feel our moral fiber stiffen into force and purpose under the inspiration of a peril dared for the advancement of truth.
I never deliver a lecture in which I do not, either directly or indirectly, give full and free expression to my faith in everything that is worthy of faith.
I cannot; I must share my intellectual life with the world.
The truth, however unwelcome, is not injurious; it is error which raises false hopes, which destroys, degrades and pollutes, and which, sooner or later, must be abandoned.
It is also a delicate one.
If I do not believe in dogma, it is because I believe in freedom.
No man can suppress the truth.
And since we are doomed to know the truth, let us cultivate a love for it.
I have a difficult subject in hand.
It may be pleasant to play with toys and dolls all our life, but evidently we are not meant to remain children always.
But first let us be impersonal.
IN CONFIDENCE
The stake!
I wish to tell you something.
One difficult task attempted is worth a thousand commonplace efforts completed.
A difficult subject is in the nature of a challenge to the mind.
Truth prevails!
We cannot help it.
It is of no avail to cry over lost illusions, to long for vanished dreams, or to call to the departing gods to come back.
But I am determined not only to know, if it is possible, the whole truth about Jesus, but also to communicate that truth to others.
Had Columbus feared danger, America might have slept for another thousand years.
Political and religious liberty were discovered through peril and struggle.
If I do not say "Lord, Lord!" to Jesus, it is because I bow my head to a greater Power than Jesus, to a more efficient Savior than he has ever been-Science!
If I am not attracted by the vision of a distant heaven, it is because I believe in human happiness, now and here.
A theory of morals without proof, that is, mere moralising, can effect nothing, because it does not act as a motive.
So died Socrates and Giordano Bruno, and so many a hero of the truth suffered death at the stake at the hands of the priests.
If it were so, virtue could be taught, and by here expressing in abstract language its nature and the knowledge which lies at its foundation, we should make every one who comprehends this even ethically better.
He sees that the distinction between himself and others, which to the bad man is so great a gulf, only belongs to a fleeting and illusive phenomenon.
But this is by no means the case.
He therefore tries to strike a balance between them, denies himself pleasures, practises renunciation, in order to mitigate the sufferings of others.
We who here seek the theory of virtue, and have therefore also to express abstractly the nature of the knowledge which lies at its foundation, will yet be unable to convey that knowledge itself in this expression.
When we are moved to tears, not through our own suffering but through that of another, this happens as follows.
When now the latter becomes perfect, it places other individuals and their fate completely on a level with itself and its own fate.
For virtue certainly proceeds from knowledge, but not from the abstract knowledge that can be communicated through words.
This penetration may exist not only in the degree which is required for justice, but also in the higher degree which leads to benevolence and well doing, to love of mankind.
Thus when dogmas lead it, what the man really and in general wills remains still the same.
All communicable knowledge, however, can only affect the will as a motive.
For these are careful only for themselves, for their own egoism, just like the bandit, from whom they are only distinguished by the absurdity of their means.
The merely just man is content not to cause it; and, in general, most men know and are acquainted with innumerable sufferings of others in their vicinity, but do not determine to mitigate them, because to do so would involve some self denial on their part.
So died Codrus, and Leonidas, and Regulus, and Decius Mus, and Arnold von Winkelried; so dies every one who voluntarily and consciously faces certain death for his friends or his country.
Quite in keeping with this, it is reported that many Hindus, even Rajas with great wealth, expend it merely on the maintenance of their position, their court and attendants, and themselves observe with the greatest scrupulousness the maxim that a man should eat nothing that he has not himself both sowed and reaped.
The deeds and conduct of an individual and of a nation may be very much modified through dogmas, example, and custom.
section sixty seven.
Thus, principally, he is seized with sympathy for the lot of all mankind, which is necessarily finite, so that every life, however aspiring, and often rich in deeds, must be extinguished and become nothing.
False dogmas do not disturb it; true ones will scarcely assist it.
There are certainly individuals who merely seem to have a good disposition on account of the weakness of the will appearing in them, but what they are soon appears from the fact that they are not capable of any remarkable self conquest in order to perform a just or good deed.
For the interest which is extended to innumerable manifestations cannot cause such anxiety as that which is concentrated upon one.
This seems to be the principal reason of the universal, and thus natural, weeping in the case of death.
One will therefore wish to render to others as much as one receives from them.
The mourner does not weep for his loss; he would be ashamed of such egotistical tears, instead of which he is sometimes ashamed of not weeping.
Yet the number of other individuals whose whole happiness or life is in danger may outweigh the regard for one's own particular well-being.
He has only received different thoughts as to the ways in which it is to be attained, and imaginary motives guide him just like real ones.
And this may take place however strong and energetic in itself the will which appears in such an individual may be.
A theory of morals which does act as a motive can do so only by working on self love.
It would, in fact, be a bad look out if the cardinal fact in the life of man, his ethical worth, that worth which counts for eternity, were dependent upon anything the attainment of which is so much a matter of chance as is the case with dogmas, religious doctrines, and philosophical theories.
Therefore we can scarcely ever pass a correct moral judgment on the action of others, and very seldom on our own.
Thus, though others have set up moral principles which they give out as prescriptions for virtue, and laws which it was necessary to follow, I, as has already been said, cannot do this because I have no "ought" or law to prescribe to the eternally free will.
Further than this it cannot go, for there exists no reason for preferring the individuality of another to its own.
Thus genuine goodness of disposition, disinterested virtue, and pure nobility do not proceed from abstract knowledge.
This disposition, however, may be quite the same when its outward manifestation is very different.
The egoist feels himself surrounded by strange and hostile individuals, and all his hope is centred in his own good.
But this distinction is very hard to make, because it lies in the heart of a man.
He is now just as little likely to allow others to starve, while he himself has enough and to spare, as any one would be to suffer hunger one day in order to have more the next day than he could enjoy.
On the other hand, pure idleness and living through the exertions of others, in the case of inherited wealth, without accomplishing anything, may be regarded as morally wrong, even if it must remain right according to positive laws.
In such a case, the character that has attained to the highest goodness and perfect nobility will entirely sacrifice its own well-being, and even its life, for the well-being of many others.
But in this lot of mankind the mourner sees first of all his own, and this all the more, the more closely he is related to him who has died, thus most of all if it is his father.
It is conceivable that a perfect state, or perhaps indeed a complete and firmly believed doctrine of rewards and punishments after death, might prevent every crime; politically much would be gained thereby; morally, nothing; only the expression of the will in life would be restricted.
He recognises himself, his will, in every being, and consequently also in the sufferer.
What has been said is also confirmed by the fact that children who have been hurt generally do not cry till some one commiserates them; thus not on account of the pain, but on account of the idea of it.
Heracles watched and Death came.
Then the light of the world went out for Admetus, and he heard himself speaking to Apollo in a shaking voice: "O Apollo, Apollo, thou art a god, and surely thou canst save me!
Go, Admetus.
And yet Heracles might be on his way from the accomplishment of some great labor, and it would not be right to say a word that might turn him away from his doorway; he might have much need of rest and refreshment.
He could not now rejoice in the company of Heracles.
Long had she been doing that wearisome labor. Admetus had known her from the first time he had come into that courtyard as a little child, and he had never seen aught in her face but a heavy misery.
But Apollo said, "Long ago, Admetus, I made a bargain with the god of the Underworld on thy behalf.
This was Heracles-Heracles come to visit him, but come at a sad hour.
"Why is the house of Admetus so hushed to day?" Heracles asked.
This was a feat that no hero had been able to accomplish.
But still Apollo stood before him with a face that was without joy.
It was a pity, he thought, that Admetus was not feasting with him.
Heracles, after the bath, put on the brightly colored tunic that the servants of Admetus brought him.
Now the footsteps seemed to stop.
"Raise her veil, Admetus," said Heracles.
Why should I not strive with Death?
He lifted Alcestis from the bed and he carried her from the palace.
There were aged men and women there, servants and slaves, and one of them would surely be willing to take the king's place and go with Death down to the Underworld.
No, not here, for he would not have Death come into the palace.
"To the god of the Underworld," said the servant.
"You cannot ask me to do this, Heracles," said Admetus.
There she was sitting as he had first known her, with her eyes bleared and her knees shaking, and with the dust of the courtyard and the husks of the corn in her matted hair.
And then a deeper joy than he had ever known came to Admetus.
Then, watching over her, he knew that not he but Alcestis would go with Death.
Heracles would watch beside her and strive with Death for her.
It is for me to tell you that the god of the Underworld will have you come to him.
"I have dragged up from the Underworld," he thought, "the hound that guards those whom Death brings down into the realm of the god of the Underworld.
"Now you are held by me, Death," cried Heracles.
He knew him by his lion's skin and his great height.
Soon a flush came into the face of Alcestis as Heracles watched over her.
A woman came with him.
The sightless man, with howls and shrieks, said he would not go.
And what a noble thing it would be to bring back this faithful woman to her house and to her husband!
"Admetus, Admetus," he said, "it is for me to tell you that you may no more look on the blue sky nor walk upon the green earth.
I won her from an enemy.
"You are held by me, and the god of the Underworld will be-made angry because you cannot go about his business-either this business or any other business.
If one will go willingly in thy place with Death, thou canst still live on.
Thinking this Admetus went up to Heracles and took his hand and welcomed him into his house.
"For my sake take her into your house," said Heracles.
She was veiled, and Admetus could not see her features.
"Now take her across your threshold, Admetus," said Heracles.
He came to the house of King Admetus and took service with him as his herdsman.
He thought that he could not bear to take her hand.
Then Admetus went into the palace and into the chamber where his bed was, and he lay down upon the bed and he lamented that he would have to go with Death that was coming for him from the god of the Underworld, and he lamented that none of the wretched ones around the palace would take his place.
Thou hast been given a chance more than any mortal man.
For a year Apollo served the young king, minding his herds of black cattle.
He put a wreath upon his head and sat down to the feast.
"What years of happiness have been mine, O Apollo, through your friendship for me," said Admetus.
After that voyage and after the hunt in Calydon Admetus went back to his own land.
Afterward people wondered at Admetus's ever smiling face and ever radiant being.
He left the palace of Admetus and he went to the temple of the gods.
He went to her and spoke to her, and he asked her to take the place of the king and go with Death.
He went toward the god and he made reverence and began to speak to him.
A pang came to Admetus as he looked at the woman who stood beside Heracles and saw that she was the same stature as his lost wife.
How noble it was of Admetus to bring him into his house and give entertainment to him while such sorrow was upon him.
And then Heracles felt that another labor was before him.
Alcestis spoke to him slowly and gravely.
He went back to the palace where all was silent-the servants moved about with heads bowed, lamenting silently for their mistress.
But Apollo turned to Admetus a face that was without joy.
But this was only the first of many feasts.
Death had never been gripped by mortal hands and he strode on as if that grip meant nothing to him.
It was the god's kindly thought of him that gave him such happiness.
Death would soon be here for her.
Then Admetus raised the veil of the woman he had taken across the threshold of his house.
A radiant figure it was, and Admetus knew that this was Apollo come to him again.
His mind was upon a great sacrifice, he said, and so he would not be able to feast with him.
How can I look upon a woman's face and remind myself that I cannot look upon Alcestis's face ever again?"
"This I cannot do," said Admetus.
Will you not take her into your house while I am away on a journey?"
But he treated him in friendly wise, and Apollo was happy whilst serving Admetus.
He sprang up, and he took the hands of Alcestis and he said, "You, then, will take my place?"
And then he came upon an ancient woman who sat upon stones in the courtyard, grinding corn between two stones.
A hand was laid upon him.
And as a mortal Apollo sought to earn his bread amongst men.
Save me now from this Death that the god of the Underworld is sending for me!"
But when she heard the name of Death horror came into the face of the ancient woman, and she cried out that she would not let Death come near her.
But Heracles pleaded with him, and he took her by the hand.
It was not so terrible for him as before.
It happened once that Zeus would punish Apollo, his son.
No more speech came from her.
Thou art well loved, and it may be that thou wilt find one to take thy place."
"To what god is that sacrifice due?"
He looked again upon his wife brought back from the grip of Death by Heracles, the son of Zeus.
And often Heracles would have Admetus beside him to tell him about the radiant god Apollo, whose bow and arrows Heracles had been given.
Admetus, Admetus, know that even now the god of the Underworld is sending Death for you."
"Admetus," Heracles said, when he came before him, "Admetus, there is something I would have you do for me.
"How is it with you, friend Admetus?" Heracles asked.
Here is a woman whom I am bringing back to her husband.
He carried her to the temple of the gods.
So Admetus thought as he went toward the palace.
Then, even as Admetus looked into her face, he saw a pallor come upon her; her body weakened and she sank down upon the bed.
And the words he had spoken he would have taken back-the words that had brought her consent to go with Death in his place.
"Ah, the sacrifice that the king is making," said Heracles.
And from the dragon's teeth that I sowed in the field of Ares armed men sprang up.
And the youths, Phrontis and Melas, were as amazed as was Jason when they found out whose ship they had come aboard.
"Begone from my sight," he cried, "robbers that ye are!
Tricksters!
Medea was passing from her father's house.
And one fountain gushed out clear water, and another gushed out milk; another gushed out wine; and another oil.
That was on a murky night, and in the morning the birds of Ares shot their sharp feathers upon us.
"I will dare this contest, monstrous as it is.
And then speaking to the king in a quiet voice, Jason said:
We have not come with such evil intent as you think.
We pulled away from that place, and thereafter we were driven by the winds back to the mouth of the Phasis.
As the dove lighted upon her shoulder she threw her veil around it, and the hawk dashed itself against a column.
Phrontis looked at the King, and said:
Also, Hephaestus, the artisan of the gods, was his friend, and Hephaestus made for him many wonderful things to be his protection.
With him there came the mightiest of the heroes of Greece.
They had ventured from Aea, where they had been reared, thinking to reach the country of Athamas and lay claim to his possessions.
As he spoke Medea, brought there by his messenger so that she might observe the strangers, came into the chamber.
But they had been wrecked at a place not far from the mouth of the Phasis, and with great pain and struggle they had made their way back.
And it may be that I shall give you the Golden Fleece to bear away after I have made trial of you."
For Jason was the grandson of Cretheus, and Cretheus was the brother of Athamas, their grandfather.
Jason took Peleus and Telamon with him.
He with his comrades would subdue them for you.
Already he has heard of your bitter foes, the Sauromatae.
They would help Jason, they said, to persuade AEetes to give the Golden Fleece peaceably to them.
Then I sowed the furrows, not with the seed that Demeter gives, but with teeth of a dragon.
Then Phrontis and Melas were some way behind.
"But the trial that I would make of you is hard for a great hero even. Know that on the plain of Ares yonder I have two fire breathing bulls with feet of brass.
I will face this doom.
Then Jason, utterly confounded, cast his eyes upon the ground.
So Phrontis said, but the King was not placated by what he said.
All the servants rushed out.
We are ready to make great recompense for the friendliness you may show to us.
But if you cannot accomplish what I once accomplished you shall go from my city empty handed; for it is not right that a brave man should yield aught to one who cannot show himself as brave."
We will subdue for you the Sauromatae, or any other people that you would lord it over."
Telamon and Peleus strode forward with angry hearts; they would have laid their hands upon King AEetes only Jason held them back.
And then he spoke to Jason, saying:
His heart was divided as to whether he should summon his armed men and have them slain upon the spot, or whether he should put them into danger by the trial he would make of them.
There we met with these heroes who were friendly to us.
The mist lifted suddenly and she saw three strangers in the palace courtyard.
And then a dove flew toward her: it was being chased by a hawk, and Medea saw the hawk's eyes and beak.
They were in a broken ship, and they had one oar only.
"Strangers to Colchis, it may be true what my nephews have said.
And as Medea, trembling, leaned against the column she heard a cry from her sister, who was within.
One had a crimson mantle on; his shoulders were such as to make him seem a man that a whole world could not overthrow, and his eyes had all the sun's light in them.
Who they are, what they have come to your city for, I shall now tell you.
But her brows were always knit as if there was some secret anger within her.
Medea, too, his wise daughter, knew the secrets taught by those who could sway the moon.
The Return To Greece
And if you would ask of the names and the lineage of the heroes who are with Jason I shall tell you.
As they came to the city a mist fell, and Jason and his comrades with the sons of Phrixus went through the city without being seen.
They gushed out into golden, silver, bronze, and iron basins.
It may be that ye are truly of the seed of the immortals.

We are to manage human enterprises more superficially and roughly, and leave a great part to fortune; it is not necessary to examine affairs with so much subtlety and so deep: a man loses himself in the consideration of many contrary lustres, and so many various forms:
Nature discovers this confusion to us; painters hold that the same motions and grimaces of the face that serve for weeping; serve for laughter too; and indeed, before the one or the other be finished, do but observe the painter's manner of handling, and you will be in doubt to which of the two the design tends; and the extreme of laughter does at last bring tears:

Between Baring Island and Beecher Point there are a considerable quantity of islands in the midst of ice fields; the streams crowd together in the little channels which cut up this part of the sea; they had a tendency to agglomerate under the relatively low temperature; hummocks were formed here and there, and these masses, already more compact, denser, and closer together, would soon form an impenetrable mass.
"He'll have two!"
The next day the sun set for the first time, ending thus the long series of days with twenty four hours in them. The men had ended by getting accustomed to the continual daylight, but it had never made any difference to the animals; the Greenland dogs went to their rest at their accustomed hour, and Dick slept as regularly every evening as though darkness had covered the sky.
"The first who touches me----" he said, brandishing a handspike. Hatteras approached him.
There the wind turned north again, and the screw was set to work.
"But, captain," replied Shandon, "what the man says----"
"I am of the same opinion as you, Johnson, and if he only wanted one faithful companion----"
"He certainly will, mr Clawbonny."
Do you hear?" Johnson, Bell, and Simpson advanced towards the sailor, who was in a terrible passion.
"I did," said Pen, advancing towards the captain.
BEGINNING OF REVOLT
"They are cowards, mr Clawbonny; those animals have no provisions as we have, and are obliged to seek their food where it is to be found. But sailors, with a good ship under their feet, ought to go to the world's end."
"You hope that Hatteras will succeed, then?"
"Yes," said he, "when it's too late," and so saying he went back to his cabin, where he had stopped almost ever since his dispute with the captain.
Seize that man!
"Go, Brunton," said Hatteras.
"If you repeat what the man says," answered Hatteras, "I'll have you shut up in your cabin and guarded!
At last, after six days of slow navigation, Point Beecher was sighted to the north on the first of August. Hatteras passed the last few hours at his masthead; the open sea that Stewart had perceived on may thirtieth eighteen fifty one, about latitude seventy six degrees twenty minutes, could not be far off; but as far as the eye could reach, Hatteras saw no indication of it.
Besides, he expected to be much worse off, and joyfully prepared for the approaching winter.
Brunton made for the hatchway, but before going down he stopped.
Hatteras returned to the poop.
"I am beginning not to," answered Wall.
The stupefied engineers hesitated to go down to the machine room.
On the fifteenth of August Mount Percy raised its peak, covered with eternal snow, through the mist.
"That Pen is a wretched fellow!" said the doctor.
Ought he to treat these accounts as apocryphal? or had the winter come upon him earlier?
"I say," answered Pen with an oath-"I say, we've had enough of it, and we won't go any further.
"Wasn't I right to say the pretended discovery was purely imagination? But they would not believe me, and even you were against me, Wall."
"Yes, mr Clawbonny, some instinct tells them they must go, and they set out."
The wind veered round south towards evening; Hatteras ordered the brig to be put under sail and the fires to be put out; the crew had to work very hard for the next few days; they were more than a week getting to Barrow Point.
Shandon looked at Wall.
On the nineteenth of August, after a pretty good observation, they sighted Cape Franklin on the east coast and Cape Lady Franklin on the west coast; the gratitude of the English people had given these names to the two opposite points-probably the last reached by Franklin: the name of the devoted wife, opposite to that of her husband, is a touching emblem of the sympathy which always united them.
Hatteras still hoped to find an open sea beyond the seventy seventh parallel, as Sir Edward Belcher had done.
The engineer, followed by Plover and Warren, went down to his post.
However, with the mobility that characterises the climate of these regions, the sun appeared from time to time, the temperature went up several degrees, obstacles melted as if by magic, and a fine sheet of water lay where icebergs bristled all the passes. The horizon glowed with those magnificent orange shades which rest the eye, tired with the eternal white of the snow.
He got rather thinner, but his constitution did not suffer.
"There's more than one amongst us who would like to imitate them, I think."
"And stuff the stove with the masts," added Warren.
"No man has ever been nearer death!" answered the captain, simply.
"Do you believe in an open sea?" asked Shandon of the lieutenant.
Still, during the nights which followed the fifteenth of August, darkness was never profound; although the sun set, he still gave sufficient light by refraction.
The uninterrupted cracking of the ice, added to the noise of the steamer, was like sighs or groans.
"mr Shandon," answered Hatteras calmly, "have that man put in irons!"
"And what did you say?" asked Hatteras.
Pieces from the ship's sheathing were often rubbed off in her contact with the ice.
A murmur was heard.
He came down without saying a word.
"Did you hear me?" cried the captain in an irritated tone.
Sometimes the clouds looked smooth and white as though they were reflections of the ice banks; but there were entire days when the yellow rays of the sun could not pierce the tenacious fog.
"Light the fires!" exclaimed some.
"What with?" asked others.
"We shall believe in you for the future, Shandon."
"Don't go, Brunton!" called out a voice.
"When we've only two months' coal in the hold!" said Pen.
"Not a word, men," said Hatteras, "or that man falls dead!" Johnson and Bell disarmed Pen, who no longer made any resistance, and placed him in the hold.
The doctor, by following Johnson's advice, accustomed himself to support the low temperature; he almost always stayed on deck braving the cold, the wind, and the snow.
"Who spoke?" cried Hatteras.
"Yes, Johnson," answered the doctor, shaking hands with the brave sailor.
You shan't kill us with hunger and work in the winter, and they shan't light the fires!"
At last the brig found a channel, and advanced painfully along it; often an enormous iceberg hindered her course for hours; the fog hindered the pilot's look out; as long as he can see for a mile in front of him, he can easily avoid obstacles; but in the midst of the fog it was often impossible to see a cable's length, and the swell was very strong.
"We shall be obliged to burn the brig down to her water line," answered Gripper.
It was not enough for them to fight and to die bravely, but cheerfully too; insomuch that they were hissed and cursed if they made any hesitation about receiving their death.

Let us see how the universal acquirements of William the Testy aided him in the affairs of government.
He had withered, in fact, not through the process of years, but through the tropical fervor of his soul, which burnt like a vehement rushlight in his bosom, inciting him to incessant broils and bickerings.
CHAPTER one
Such promised to be the case with William the Testy, who grew tough in proportion as he dried.
In this respect a little sound judgment and plain common sense is worth all the sparkling genius that ever wrote poetry or invented theories.
I have heard it observed by a profound adept in human physiology that if a woman waxes fat with the progress of years her tenure of life is somewhat precarious, but if haply she withers as she grows old, she lives for ever.
Of metaphysics he knew enough to confound all hearers and himself into the bargain.
His appearance answered to his name.
The vast acquirements of the new governor were the theme of marvel among the simple burghers of New Amsterdam; he figured about the place as learned a man as a Bonze at Pekin, who has mastered one half of the Chinese alphabet; and was unanimously pronounced a "universal genius!"

It is thus the historians may be said to thrive on the miseries of mankind, like birds of prey which hover over the field of battle to fatten on the mighty dead.
In logic, he knew the whole family of syllogisms and dilemmas, and was so proud of his skill that he never suffered even a self evident fact to pass unargued.

I have known in my time many a genius of this stamp; but, to speak my mind freely, I never knew one who, for the ordinary purposes of life, was worth his weight in straw.
Tyrants, robbers, conquerors, renowned only for the magnitude of their misdeeds and the stupendous wrongs and miseries they have inflicted on mankind-warriors, who have hired themselves to the trade of blood, not from motives of virtuous patriotism, or to protect the injured and defenseless, but merely to gain the vaunted glory of being adroit and successful in massacring their fellow beings!
mr Hardy has undoubtedly made an original contribution to the poetry of his time.
It is false to picture him as always on his knees before the grave worm.
More than this, he can look forward beyond war to the coming of a new patriotism of the world.
What one does bless mr Hardy for, however, both in his verse and in his prose, is his bleak sincerity.
Yet, I feel, If some one said on Christmas Eve, "Come; see the oxen kneel
Lovers are always severed both in life and in death:--
His music is a still small voice unevenly matched against his consciousness of midnight and storm.
Especially is he sensitive to the pain and passion of frustrated lovers.
He does not express life easily in beautiful words or in images.
His lovers, like his soldiers, rot in the grave defeated of their glory.
One can see how very mournful mr Hardy's genius is if one compares it with that of Browning, his master in the art of the dramatic lyric.
Who knows, indeed....
Truth to tell, mr Hardy is neither sufficiently articulate nor sufficiently fastidious to be a great poet.
"And, General, how hold out our sweethearts, Sworn loyal as doves?" "Many mourn; many think It is not unattractive to prink Them in sable for heroes.
When we, as strangers, sought Their catering care, Veiled smiles bespoke their thought Of what we were.
is a line of good poetry.
His imagination has always been curiously interested in soldiers, but that is more because they have added a touch of colour to the tragic game of life than because he is on the side of the military show.
"How long," he cries, in a poem written some years ago:--
Some fickle and fleet hearts Have found them new loves."
mr Hardy has too bitter a sense of reality to believe much in the glory of war.
Christmas Eve, and twelve of the clock, "Now they are all on their knees," An elder said as we sat in a flock By the embers in hearthside ease.
The conceptions in his novels are infinitely more poetic than the conceptions in his verse.
The mood of faith, however-or, rather, of delight in the memory of faith-is not mr Hardy's prevailing mood.
Only a man harrowing clods In a slow silent walk With an old horse that stumbles and nods Half asleep as they stalk.
At the same time, his unfaith relates to the duration of love rather than to human destiny.
Take, for example, the use of the word "domiciled" in the passage in the same poem about-
He has a temperament sensitive beyond that of all but a few recent writers to the pain and passion of human beings.
But Time, to make me grieve, Part steals, lets part abide; And shakes this fragile frame at eve With throbbings of noontide.
The real world to mr Hardy is the world of ancient human things, in which war has come to be a hideous irrelevance.
In the poem which contains these verses the emotion of the poet gives words often undistinguished an almost Elizabethan rhythm.
Browning is also a poet of frustrated lovers.
It has about as much truth in it as the statement that Milton was greater as a controversialist than as a poet, or that Lamb's plays are better than his essays.
It is too long to quote in full, but one may give the last verses of this lyric of lovers in a lane:--
On the larger canvas of his prose we find a vision more abundant, more varied, more touched with humour.
Yonder a maid and her wight Come whispering by; War's annals will fade into night Ere their story die
"And our wives?" quoth another, resignedly, "Dwell they on our deeds?" "Deeds of home; that live yet Fresh as new-deeds of fondness or fret, Ancient words that were kindly expressed or unkindly, These, these have their heeds."
"Catering care" is an appalling phrase.
For then, I, undistrest, By hearts grown cold to me, Could lonely wait my endless rest With equanimity.
Intermissive aim at the thing sufficeth,
His world is a place of opulence, not of poverty.
But what a sense of triumph there is in Browning's tragedies!
And prose intrudes in the choice of words as well as in images.
He is not by temperament a singer.
Whither?
"In the lonely barton by yonder coomb Our childhood used to know," I should go with him in the gloom, Hoping it might be so.
I do not wish to over emphasize the significance of flaws of this kind. But, at a time when all the world is eager to do honour to mr Hardy's poems, it is surely well to refrain from doing equal honour to his faults.
mr Hardy, fortunately, has the genius to express the burden and the mystery even of a world grey with rain and commonplace in achievement. There is a beauty of sorrow in these poems in which "life with the sad, seared face" mirrors itself without disguise.
At least half his poems, I fancy, are poems of frustration.
We must, then, be grateful without niggardliness for the gift of his verse.
To have loved for an hour is, in mr Hardy's imagination, to have deepened the sadness even more than the beauty of one's memories.
That is one of the mild heresies in which the amateur of letters loves to indulge.
They bring us face to face with an experience intenser than our own.
His faith in beauty and joy may be only a thin flame, but it is never extinguished.
No shade of pinnacle or tree or tower, While earth endures, Will fall on my mound and within the hour Steal on to yours; One robin never haunt our two green covertures.
Not that mr Hardy's is quite so miserable a genius as is commonly supposed.
The day is turning ghost, And scuttles from the kalendar in fits and furtively, To join the anonymous host Of those that throng oblivion; ceding his place, maybe, To one of like degree....
Dostoevsky, however, has created a whole flock of these abnormal characters and watches over them as a hen over her chickens.
Two peasants, middle aged men, friends who had known each other for a long time and were not drunk, had had tea and were meaning to go to bed in the same room.
The novels are the perfect image of the man.
Love itself is with him, as with Strindberg and D'Annunzio, for the most part only a sort of rearrangement of hatred.
His passions are such as come before the criminal rather than the civil courts.
And beyond the dark night of suffering, and dissipating the night, Dostoevsky still sees the light of Christian compassion.
He took a knife, and when his friend had turned away, he approached him cautiously from behind, took aim, turned his eyes heavenwards, crossed himself, and praying fervently "God forgive me, for Christ's sake!" he cut his friend's throat at one stroke like a sheep and took his watch.
"Serve him right!" shouted Dmitri, breathlessly.
"Madman!
We sympathize, indeed, with the fears, the bravado, the despair that succeed the crime.
Their ups and downs are like the ups and downs in a fight between cat and dog.
But it is the sensational drama of a cruel world that most persistently haunts his imagination.
Yet to Dostoevsky such aberrations of conduct make a continuous and overwhelming appeal.
Scenes that in an ordinary novel would take place with two or three figures on the stage are represented in Dostoevsky as taking place before a howling, seething mob.
mr Murry will have it that the actions in the novels take place in a "timeless" world, largely because Dostoevsky has the habit of crowding an impossible rout of incidents into a single day.
Because they are possessed they are no longer men and women.
He is a grotesque made alive by sheer imaginative intensity and passion.
It is one of the triumphs of his genius that, however many persons he introduces, he never allows them to be confused into a hopeless chaos. His story finds its way unimpeded through the mob.
His work, like his face, bears the mark of this terrible conflict.
So incongruous, indeed, is the sensational framework of his stories with the immense and sombre genius that broods over them that mr Murry is inclined to regard the incidents as a sort of wild spiritual algebra rather than as events occurring on the plane of reality.
The cry is, I fancy, repeated in others of Dostoevsky's novels.
The man was not a thief; he was an honest man, in fact, and by a peasant's standard by no means poor.
He may in the last analysis be a great mystic or a great psychologist; but he almost always reveals his genius on a stage crowded with people who behave like the men and women one reads about in the police news.
The crimes in his books seem to spring, not from more or less rational causes, but from some seed of lunacy.
His people are possessed with devils as the people in all but religious fiction have long ceased to be.
His people are energetic and untamed, like cowboys or runaway horses.
His work is all earthquake and eclipse and dead stars apart from this.
Here, for example, is a characteristic Dostoevsky story put in the Prince's mouth:
Alyosha helped him with his slender strength, holding Dmitri in front.
The old man moaned shrilly.
He releases them from most of the ordinary inhibitions.
To him Dostoevsky's work is "the record of a great mind seeking for a way of life; it is more than a record of struggle, it is the struggle itself." Dostoevsky himself is a man of genius "lifted out of the living world," and unable to descend to it again.
Even the talk is of actions more than of ideas.
Nor, on the other hand, was he a novelist of horrors for horrors' sake.
His world is an inferno.
One would not accept that incident from any Western author.
He does not, mr Murry urges, believe, as has often been said, that men are purified by suffering.
was very fond of hanging cats, and burying them with great ceremony.
Dostoevsky's people, it is suggested, "are not so much men and women as disembodied spirits who have for the moment put on mortality."
But the secret of Dostoevsky's appeal is something more than the multitude and thrill of his incidents and characters.
He invents vicious grotesques as Dickens invents comic grotesques.
He kicked him two or three times with his heel in the face.
Dostoevsky was no realist.
It is always lust with a knife.
No melodramatist ever poured out incident upon the stage from such a horn of plenty.
Dostoevsky's characters describe the execution of a criminal, the whipping of an ass, the torture of a child.
If Dostoevsky had had less vision he would have been Strindberg.
And those voices take shape in certain unforgettable fragments of dialogue that have been spoken by one spirit to another in some ugly, mean tavern, set in surrounding darkness.
And so there is.
DOSTOEVSKY THE SENSATIONALIST
And yet practically all of them remain separate and created beings.
This is all in a measure true.
It is surely a kind of faith, though a despairing kind.
That is characteristic at once of Dostoevsky's mastery and his monstrous profusion.
His people more nearly resemble madmen and wild beasts than normal human beings.
As for the Karamazovs themselves, he portrays the old father and the eldest of his sons hating each other and fighting like brutal maniacs:
They might be described as runaway human beings.
If his vision had been aesthetic and sensual, he might have been D'Annunzio.
Dostoevsky's visible world was a world of sensationalism.
He sometimes even portrays the two kinds of love in the same person.
But they are never in balance; they are always in demoniacal conflict.
When he became excited on a certain point, one could have sworn that one had seen him before seated on a bench in a police court awaiting trial, or among vagabonds who passed their time begging before the prison doors.
"Dostoevsky," he declares, "is not a novelist.
Incident follows breathlessly upon incident.
There was never so much talk in any other novels, and there was never so much action.
One does not grudge an artist an abnormal character or two.
Or, rather, both hatred and love are volcanic outbursts of the same passion.
mr Murry boldly faces the difficulty and attempts the definition.
He does also portray an almost Christ like love, a love that is outside the body and has the nature of a melting and exquisite charity.
In the evening I stopped for the night at a provincial hotel, and a murder had been committed there the night before....
They have no physical being.
The face was that of a Russian peasant; a real Moscow mujik, with a flat nose, small, sharp eyes deeply set, sometimes dark and gloomy, sometimes gentle and mild.
One result of this is a multiplicity of action.
Ivan, though not so strong as Dmitri, threw his arms round him, and with all his might pulled him away.
You've killed him!" cried Ivan.
"If I haven't killed him, I'll come again and kill him."
His drawn, twitching features seemed to press down on his sad looking mouth.... Eyelids, lips, and every muscle of his face twitched nervously the whole time.
For an awful moment I seem to see things with the eye of eternity, and have a vision of suns grown cold, and hear the echo of voices calling without sound across the waste and frozen universe.
Like them, he is a novelist of torture.
It was another one further along, that went like this:
This scheme did not appeal to him.
"That may all be true," said I, "but why do you tell me?
After he'd eaten a fair meal he fell asleep.
It was like listening to one end of a telephone, though we didn't know what telephones were in those days.
Then I scouted to see what had cut me, and found that the fellow had lost a hand.
"If you don't like it, leave it," said I, "and get out, and be damned to you."
"Now, look here," said I, "you can't get up to day.
I really think I was just in time to save the man's life.
As I was bending over the fire he spoke.
I saw him off and on.
It's all very well to say gratitude, but that don't go with me.
That brought him to.
"That's all right," said I, "but you better stay right there."
"Where's my clothes?" he demanded again, very fierce.
"Why, mate," he answered, "it's just plain gratitude.
Finally we compromised.
"I ween heem at monte off Antonio Curvez," said he.
In place of it he wore a sharp steel hook.
I ran up, pulling my gun.
It's money I got to have, and it's money I haven't got, and can't get unless I let somebody in as pardner."
He was not the least bit afraid.
"I know," he pleaded, "but let me see them."
In the half light I could see his face change.
He looked at me sideways, spat, and looked at me sideways again.
At this moment the heavy beat of the storm on the roof ceased with miraculous suddenness, leaving the outside world empty of sound save for the DRIP, DRIP, DRIP of eaves.
I could mighty near furnish the replies sometimes.
This was in December.
Or else he'd just talk.
There was no doubt of his being alive, for he was breathing hard, like a man does when he gets hit over the head.
"You had no coat when I picked you up," I replied.
"And it's a big thing," said Handy Solomon to me, "for they's not only gold, but altar jewels and diamonds.
It will make us rich, and a dozen like us, and you can kiss the Book on that."
He stood there looking straight at me without winking or offering to move.
On the middle of his back knelt my one armed friend. And that sharp hook was caught neatly under the point of the Mexican's jaw.
"What do you want?" I asked.
Without further delay he arose to his feet.
I hadn't any more than got the words out of my mouth before he was atop me.
Anyway, I thrust the muzzle of my Colt's into the sailor's face.
We talked the matter over at length.
"They'll be four of you to one of me; and I don't like it, and you can kiss the Book on that."
Usually I didn't bother with his talk, for it didn't mean anything, but something in his voice made me turn.
He sat up as though he'd been touched with a hot poker, stared around wild eyed, and cut loose with that song you were singing.
"Get up and give it here!" he demanded.
At the same instant I heard the rip of steel through cloth and felt a sharp stab in my left leg.
Then I put my six shooter on.
"I want to make up to you for your trouble," said he.
In any case, he flew poco pronto, leaving me and my friend together.
"Treasure," said he.
His method was a winner.
Then I caught sight of him quite a ways off.
He looked at me mighty suspicious, but didn't say anything more-he wouldn't even answer when I spoke to him.
You ain't fit."
When a man breathes that way he's mostly all gone.
It's a quality with a hell of a hang fire to it."
But he'd been too sick and too long abed.
They're safe enough."'
He looked all right enough, neither drunk nor loco.
We had every sort of people with us off and on, and, as I was lookout at a popular game, I saw them all.
I don't know whether he'd really won the coat at monte or not.
And I got to have help with the treasure, if it's like this fellow said it was.
"This man has my coat," he explained.
Just to satisfy him I passed over his old duds.
I dragged him out into the light.
However, he didn't stay long in that frame of mind.
Across his forehead ran a long gash, cutting his left eyebrow square in two.
Why don't you get your treasure without the need of dividing it?"
Sour wine is fine to put a wound in shape to heal, but it's no soothing syrup.
He strongly opposed this as depreciating the shares, but I had no intention of going alone into what was then considered a wild and dangerous country.
"Maybe," growled the sailor.
You bet he lay still.
During the next two months he was a good deal about town, mostly doing odd jobs.
And the Yaquis and cannibals from Tiburon is through the country.
"Why me?" I asked.
He was lying on his side, those black eyes of his blazing at me, but now both of them saw the same distance.
In a minute or so he came to.
The gleam died from his eye; the snarl left his lips.
But it was all little stuff.
He began when he was a kid, and he gave his side of conversations, pausing for replies.
I didn't pay any attention to him, for he was quiet.
"Why not?" he retorted.
"I've been robbed," he cried.
When I came back that evening the bunk was empty and he was gone.
He had me by the throat with his hand, and I felt the point of the hook pricking the back of my neck.
What do you think I'd want with them?
"For heaven's sake," I yelled at him, "what's the matter with you and your old clothes?
Well, he was clean out of his head for nigh two weeks.
He was a slim built young fellow, with straight black hair, long and lank and oily, a lean face, and big hooked nose.
However, I didn't pay much attention to that, being at the time almighty busy holding down my card games.
Finally he agreed; but he refused me a look at the chart, saying that he had left it in a safe place.
This I had tangled up with and gotten well pricked.
One little squeeze-Talk about your deadly weapons!
"What's this?" I asked.
"Here I pick you up on the street and save your worthless carcass, and the first chance you get you try to crawl my hump.
I intended to take no more chances with that hook.
Well, it was really none of my business, as you might say.
That was when he was best.
He nodded at me very sour, and dodged around the corner of the store.
"Now you're a nice, sweet proposition," said I, as soon as I was sure he could understand me.
"How do I know you plays fair?" he complained.
"Look here, Anderson, or Handy Solomon, or whatever you please to call yourself," I rejoined to this, "if you're going to do business with me-and I do not understand yet just what it is you want of me-you'll have to talk straight.
That was the worst performance of all.
A third of the treasure was to go to him, a third to me, and the rest was to be divided among the men whom I should select.
"The devil's a preacher, if you ain't lost your pinfeathers,"' said he. "Well, it's this then: I got to have a boat to get there; and she must be stocked.
"Where's my coat?" he asked.
The brander pressed the iron smoothly against the flank.
Homer, Wooden, and old California john rode in among the cattle.
As the loop settled, he jerked sharply upward, exactly as one would strike to hook a big fish.
An occasional and exceedingly husky bull yearling declined to be upset in any such manner.
Near the fire the horse stopped.
Finally Homer rode over to the Cattleman and reported the branding finished.
Seemingly but a moment later the cook's howl brought me to consciousness again.
Imagine a puncher descending to examine politely the ear tags of wild cattle on the open range or in a round up.
In ten minutes Charley pronounced the irons ready.
Then one or the other threw off the rope. Homer rode away, coiling the rope as he went.
Unbranded calves were scarce.
"One hundred and seventy six," he announced.
Behind him followed his anxious mother, her head swinging from side to side.
One stood waiting for them to finish, a sheaf of long j h stamping irons in his hand.
The first rays of the sun slanted across in one great sweep from the remote mountains.
It was not forth coming.
Through the wide gates the cattle were urged out to the open plain. There they were held for over an hour while the cows wandered about looking for their lost progeny.
All the rest squatted on their heels along the fence, smoking cigarettes and chatting together.
The markers, squatted on their heels, told over the bits of ears they had saved.
mr Frost's bull calf alone in pictorial history shows the attitudes.
In the meantime the marker was engaged in his work.
"You fellows drive me plumb weary," remarked the rider, slowly dismounting.
A clear, licking little fire danced in the blackness.
You can imagine what happened next.
By now the branding was in full swing.
"Hot iron!" yelled one of the bull doggers.
The brand showed cherry, which is the proper colour to indicate due peeling and a successful mark.
Men ran to and fro busy and intent.
The rest of the men arose and stretched their legs and advanced.
Hot irons, hot language, and dust filled the air.
Rarely did the cast fail.
Before it moved silhouettes of men already eating.
But in the circumstance of a free range, thousands of cattle, and hundreds of owners, any other method is out of the question.
Inextinguishable laughter followed the spread of this doctrine through Arizona.
A calf usually bellows when the iron bites, but as soon as released he almost invariably goes to feeding or to looking idly about.
But, as I have intimated, even the inevitable branding and ear marking are not so painful as one might suppose.
When we arrived we found the string of ponies standing around outside.
One knelt on its head and twisted back its foreleg in a sort of hammer lock; the other seized one hind foot, pressed his boot heel against the other hind leg close to the body, and sat down behind the animal.
And then, of course, there was the gorgeous contrast between all this frantic and uncomprehending excitement and the absolute matter of fact imperturbability of horse and rider.
Indeed, I have never seen one even take the trouble to lick his wounds, which is certainly not true in the case of the injuries they inflict on each other in fighting.
Sometimes three or four calves were on the ground at once.
It was promptly flopped over on its right side.
"Marker!" yelled the other.
The critter had been caught by the two hind legs.
First, with a sharp knife he cut off slanting the upper quarter of one ear.
I joined the Cattleman, and together we made our way afoot to the branding pen.
Toward the middle of the morning the bull doggers began to get a little tired.
And that went.
Then he would spit on his hands and go at it alone.
The calf sprang up, was appropriated and smelled over by his worried mother, and the two departed into the herd to talk it over.
Homer wrapped the rope twice or thrice about the horn, and sat over in one stirrup to avoid the tightened line and to preserve the balance.
The total amounted to but an hundred and seventy five. Everybody went to searching for the missing bit.
The three ropers sat their horses, idly swinging the loops of their ropes back and forth.
When once you have had the wind knocked out of you, or a rib or two broken, you cease to think this unnecessarily rough.
Immediately two men ran forward.
I piled out and joined the group.
This is productive of some fun if it fails.
No dreams visited us, but in accordance with the immemorial habit of those who live out-whether in the woods, on the plains, among the mountains, or at sea-once during the night each of us rose on his elbow, looked about him, and dropped back to sleep.
Sometimes the men rode here and there for a minute or so before their eyes fell on a pair of uncropped ears.
Toward noon the work slacked.
That took up about half the men.
This tightened the loop and prevented it from slipping off.
Homer was busy distributing his men for the day.
"A little bit of a calf like that!
In a brief moment it was over.
Three were to care for the remuda; five were to move the stray herd from the corrals to good feed; three branding crews were told to brand the calves we had collected in the cut of the afternoon before.
Therefore the noise was deafening, and the motion incessant.
All that night we slept like sticks of wood.
The rest were to make a short drive in the salt grass.
"Would you like to have me tote it to you, or do you reckon you could toddle this far with yore little old iron?"
In such case he was generally snubbed up short enough at the end of the rope; but once or twice he succeeded in running around a group absorbed in branding.
Such good luck did not always follow, however.
When the nooses fell, they turned and walked toward the fire as a matter of course.
In a moment Homer leaned forward and threw.
Undoubtedly it is to some extent painful, and could some other method of ready identification be devised, it might be as well to adopt it in preference.
The bull doggers flatly refused to have anything to do with it. An obvious way out would have been to flip off the loop and try again; but of course that would have amounted to a confession of wrong.
A smoke and the smell of scorching hair arose. Perhaps the calf blatted a little as the heat scorched.
The three horses came and went phlegmatically.
We were the only ones who did go afoot, however, although the corrals were not more than two hundred yards' distant.
"No more necked calves," they announced.
The two "bull doggers" immediately pounced upon the victim.
The latter counted the marks in his tally book.
Once in a while the rider, lazy, or careless, or bothered by the press of numbers, dragged up a victim caught by the neck.
This matter satisfactorily adjusted, the men all ran for their ponies. They had been doing a wrestler's heavy work all the morning, but did not seem to be tired.
Nobody paid any attention to the calf.
"There's yore little calf," said he.
Cries arose in a confusion: "Marker" "Hot iron!" "Tally one!" Dust eddied and dissipated.
But if the calf gave much trouble, then all work ceased while the unfortunate puncher wrestled it down.
Between the upright bars of greasewood we could see the cattle, and near the opposite side the men building a fire next the fence.
He had distinctly begun to love Nichola, and he felt sick and almost resentful.
They talked over the day's news, and then an organ began to grind outside.
How that chestnut hair of hers had shone: it required no tiara to set it off, like that of the dowager he had seen there, who had put ten thousand pounds upon her head to make herself look worse than she would have appeared with the ninepenny muslin cap of a servant woman.
'No: I shall not care to come again,' he answered, in a tone inaudible to the young ladies.
He determined to call immediately on the New Incarnation.
'Now, I'll tell you all about it,' said he gravely.
The spring in the present case was the artistic commendation she deserved and craved.
The lady on Jocelyn's left, wife of a Lord Justice of Appeal, was in like manner talking to her companion on the outer side; so that, for the time, he was left to himself.
But happily his affection was incipient as yet, and a sudden sense of the ridiculous in his own position carried him to the verge of risibility during the scene.
'Don't you feel lonely in it sometimes?'
So he dined on, catching her eyes and the few pretty words she made opportunity to project across the table to him now and then.
She signified a chair, and began the critical study of some rings she wore.
She looked very charming between the candles, and then suddenly it dawned upon him that her previous manner must have originated in some false report about Marcia, of whose existence he had not heard for years.
As the other guests dropped in, the pair retreated into a shady corner, and she talked beside him till all moved off for the eating and drinking.
'How I wish I could run after him!'
Good bye,' said Pierston.
He was now over forty, she was probably thirty; and he dared not make unmeaning love with the careless selfishness of a younger man.
But was he able?
He was courteously responsive only, but mrs Pine Avon herself distinctly made advances.
'O never!'
She had been the first arrival.
It was unfair to go further without telling her, even though, hitherto, such explicitness had not been absolutely demanded.
'Now what the devil this means I cannot tell,' he said to himself, reflecting stock still for a moment on the stairs.
'Yes; I have had my house some years,' she observed complacently, 'and I like it better every year.'
But Jocelyn was receding from the pretty widow's house with long strides.
'Yes?'
'O! didn't he marry her?' said mrs Pine Avon, with a start.
He had not been appointed to take her across to the dining room, but at the table found her exactly opposite.
To be sure it was mrs Nichola Pine Avon, but frosted over indescribably.
When, shortly after eleven, he came away, he felt almost certain that within those luminous grey eyes the One of his eternal fidelity had verily taken lodgings-and for a long lease.
But somehow the very bell pull seemed cold, although she had so earnestly asked him to come.
They were round, inquiring, luminous.
As the house spoke, so spoke the occupant, much to the astonishment of the sculptor.
But this was not all.
But the end of the letter was what arrested him-
'You will be sorry to hear, Sir, that dear little Avice Caro, as we used to call her in her maiden days, is dead.
She followed him to the door.
'You would find this is often done, with excellent effect.'
And yet the meaning was staring him in the face.
He went out very little during the next few days, but about a week later he kept an engagement to dine with Lady Iris Speedwell, whom he never neglected, because she was the brightest hostess in London.
'It is based on a sound old melody called "The Jilt's Hornpipe." Just as they turn Madeira into port in the space of a single night, so this old air has been taken and doctored, and twisted about, and brought out as a new popular ditty.'
She asked him to come again; and he thought he would tell the truth.
Afterwards they kept apart awhile in the drawing room for form's sake; but eventually gravitated together again, and finished the evening in each other's company.
Anyhow, he was not disposed to resent an inexplicability in womankind, having found that it usually arose independently of fact, reason, probability, or his own deserts.
He had his doubts.
She was, in a word, willing to go on.
'Indeed!'
Having hardly a correspondent in that part of the world now he began to conjecture on the possible sender.
'It is rather uncivil.
'Jocelyn Pierston.'
Pierston drew it sufficiently forth to observe by the post mark that it came from his natal isle.
'What an uncivil thing to say!' she murmured in surprise.
Meanwhile one of the three young ladies had said, 'What interesting man was that, with his lovely head of hair?
I saw him at Lady Channelcliffe's the other night.'
This climax of the series had been reached to night on the aforesaid moor, and for the first time in the season its irregularities were forms without features; suggestive of anything, proclaiming nothing, and without more character than that of being the limit of something else-the lowest layer of a firmament of snow.
This was followed by a voice from the same quarter.
I don't like to come to the Barracks.
It smacked against the wall at a point several yards from its mark.
What then?"
"Do we?
The shape went slowly along, but without much exertion, for the snow, though sudden, was not as yet more than two inches deep.
"Yes"
The river would have been seen by day to be of that deep smooth sort which races middle and sides with the same gliding precision, any irregularities of speed being immediately corrected by a small whirlpool.
Don't speak like that.
"Don't cry, now!
Here the spot stopped, and dwindled smaller.
It was a night when sorrow may come to the brightest without causing any great sense of incongruity: when, with impressible persons, love becomes solicitousness, hope sinks to misgiving, and faith to hope: when the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret at opportunities for ambition that have been passed by, and anticipation does not prompt to enterprise.
It was a neighbouring clock striking ten.
"I don't quite recollect."
"I did not expect you to night.
"Not to morrow.
It weighs me to the earth.
The throw was the idea of a man conjoined with the execution of a woman.
"Well-I said that you might."
"Can you-come to me!"
"Yes-so am i And Frank, when will it be?"
There are bad women about, and they think me one."
Below, down to the water's edge, the flat was unbroken by hole or projection.
Forgive me!"
"Then I shan't see you till then!"
I'll go away now.
Five."
"Your wife, Fanny Robin."
Well-you have to get proper clothes."
Don't, dear Frank-will you-for I love you so.
Between each utterance the little shape advanced about half a dozen yards.
"How did you get here from Weatherbury?"
I am orderly to morrow."
"Oh, Frank-don't you know me?" said the spot.
"That you promised."
"Yes-yes-it is.
"To morrow?"
The scene was a public path, bordered on the left hand by a river, behind which rose a high wall.
"One.
On the right was a tract of land, partly meadow and partly moor, reaching, at its remote verge, to a wide undulating upland.
For dreariness nothing could surpass a prospect in the outskirts of a certain town and military station, many miles north of Weatherbury, at a later hour on this same snowy evening-if that may be called a prospect of which the chief constituent was darkness.
The tones were masculine, and not those of surprise.
The bell was in the open air, and being overlaid with several inches of muffling snow, had lost its voice for the time.
Still, to a close observer, they are just as perceptible; the difference is that their media of manifestation are less trite and familiar than such well-known ones as the bursting of the buds or the fall of the leaf.
"Banns, I should think."
"I asked which was your window.
This was all that was positively discoverable, though it seemed human.
"O you do!
Will it be by banns or license?"
The bugle has sounded, the barrack gates are closed, and I have no leave.
The indistinct summit of the facade was notched and pronged by chimneys here and there, and upon its face were faintly signified the oblong shapes of windows, though only in the upper part.
At this time some words were spoken aloud:--
"What?"
And the noise was again heard of a window closing.
Indeed, I did not think you would come at all.
"Who's there?"
"Oh yes-of course."
"Yes," said the girl, with a half suppressed gasp of emotion.
Not long after a form moved by the brink of the river.
"Yes, I mean that I might.
"And we live in two parishes."
We are all of us as good as in the county gaol till to morrow morning."
This person was so much like a mere shade upon the earth, and the other speaker so much a part of the building, that one would have said the wall was holding a conversation with the snow.
Many are not so stealthy and gradual as we may be apt to imagine in considering the general torpidity of a moor or waste.
"How did you come here?"
"What girl are you?"
My dear Fan, no!
"Fanny!" said the wall, in utter astonishment.
Good night."
It makes me say what ought to be said first by you."
"Is that the law?"
"O, must I?--it is, when shall we be married, Frank?"
"Quite, so.
"No, not yet."
"The fact is, I forgot to ask.
"Never mind-say it."
"You said I was to come."
By its outline upon the colourless background, a close observer might have seen that it was small.
"I have money.
It is foolish.
You said you almost had before you left Casterbridge."
An indescribable succession of dull blows, perplexing in their regularity, sent their sound with difficulty through the fluffy atmosphere.
"Is it Sergeant Troy?" said the blurred spot in the snow, tremulously.
"I walked-some part of the way-the rest by the carriers."
"Good night, Frank-good night!"
We'll settle in a few days."
"I am surprised."
Three.
Then a morsel of snow flew across the river towards the fifth window.
If I said so, of course I will."
OUTSIDE THE BARRACKS-SNOW-A MEETING
"You have the permission of the officers?"
"Yes," came suspiciously from the shadow.
The little spot moved away.
If they would put out their hands to him, why should he refuse to put out his own?
Pride in him might be as weak as pride in them.
I know you'll be ashamed of me, and then we shall both be unhappy."
And I must have a pair of gloves and a black coat."
"But you must go also."
She looked wistfully up into his face.
Two letters were written accepting the invitation.
THINGS ARRANGE THEMSELVES.
The husband should be to her in all respects the first and foremost.
"The Countess Lovel presents her compliments to Miss Lovel.
"If you really wish it, you shall go," he said.
MY DEAR LORD,
"You shall if you like, and I'll make it for you."
"I can do that too."
"I don't see why you shouldn't hold up your head with any man in England," said Lady Anna.
Would you not desire wealth in order that you might be assisted by it in your views of ambition?
This reply was received at Yoxham three days before any answer came either from Lady Anna or from the tailor.
"And so I ought;--but I shouldn't.
"I quite agree with you that the silk gowns should be kept for their elders," and so the conversation was ended.
"It is one to which all legislative and all human efforts should and must tend.
"Pardon me.
The theory of equality is very grand."
"No one should,--unless I be mean and despicable.
"The grandest thing in the world, Sir William."
But they do,--you may be sure.
With her there was a real wish that the poles might be joined together by her future husband.
"Not so," replied Sir William.
"When you make much water boil, mr Thwaite, some of it will probably boil over.
I will never be ashamed of you.
But you can't make me like a lord, or think that a young man ought to wear a silk gown."
But the Countess never gave way an inch.
"I will go," said he.
"Yes;--for one day.
"They can't but despise me, you know," said the tailor.
The subject is so large that I should like to discuss it with you when we have more time.
DANIEL THWAITE.
"And a blue one,--to be married in."
When you were a workman among workmen, did you not wish to be their leader?
It was a matter that required to be considered.
"They were poles asunder, if you will. But by your good fortune and merit, if you will allow me to say so, you have travelled from the one pole very far towards the other."
What does it all signify, if you are not happy?"
"The tailor must behave himself properly," said Lady Anna.
I will be ashamed of them if they are not good to you.
"Why should the children of lords be such to the tenth and twentieth generation?"
"Would you like to go to Yoxham?" he said.
If mayor, would you not wish to be its representative in Parliament?
The Countess disapproves altogether of the marriage which is about to take place between Lady Anna Lovel and mr Daniel Thwaite, and will take no part in the ceremony."
Must I have a pink silk gown to walk about in, early in the morning?"
I should not know how to drink wine with them, and should do a hundred things which would make them think me a beast."
"They are cousins, you know," said Lady Anna.
"I won't be ashamed of you.
Not the less do I feel your courtesy, and I am,
It is only human nature that they should.
"As when one man throws away forty thousand a year on race courses."
On the following day, Lady Anna was with him as usual; for the pretext of his wound still afforded to her the means of paying to him those daily visits which in happier circumstances he would naturally have paid to her.
She was much obliged, she said, to the rector for his goodness in promising to marry them; and as she had no friends of her own she hoped that Minnie Lovel would be her bridesmaid.
If you were a master tradesman, would you not wish to lead and guide your brother tradesmen?
When you were foremost among them, did you not wish to be their master?
But if the cousins were willing to accept her husband, why should he not be willing to be accepted?
With all sincerity, Your lordship's very obedient servant,
We are made of different fabric,--though the stuff was originally the same.
"And there was a little girl there I loved so much."
But could you establish absolute equality in England to morrow, as it was to have been established in France some half century ago, the inequality of men's minds and character would re-establish an aristocracy within twenty years.
"I cannot, and so you have the best of me.
When two men run a race, some strength must be wasted in fruitless steps beyond the goal.
She persisted in the determination to go on to London by an early morning train, and he therefore offered advice on lesser matters only. 'In that case,' he said, 'you must go up to your room and send down your things, that they may be dried by the fire immediately, or they will not be ready.
My father's is a comparatively humble residence hard by.'
It would be too awkward for you to go there alone.'
I have left my father for ever!
'Oh, but you know me-about me, at least.'
The thing had not, however, taken place; and he went on thinking how soft and warm the lady was in her fur covering, as he held her so tightly; the only dry spots in the clothing of either being her left side and his right, where they excluded the rain by their mutual pressure.
I will tell the servant to do this, and send you up something to eat.'
Jocelyn thought it strange that he should be thrown by fate into a position to play the son of the Montagues to this daughter of the Capulets.
'I must sit here till it stops.'
He hoped nothing serious had happened to drag her out at such an untoward time.
'If you ever do in this hurricane.'
He felt ravenously hungry himself, and set about drying his clothes as well as he could, and eating at the same time.
Into it they plodded without pause, crossing the harbour bridge about midnight, wet to the skin.
After making over his large business to the company, he retired, I believe, to London?'
My train has gone.'
'I'll return with you.
They crouched so close to each other that he could feel her furs against him.
I am sorry I should have spoken so disrespectfully of him, for I never knew him personally.
Quantities of sea water trickled through the pebble wall, and ran in rivulets across their path to join the sea within.
'The ethereal substance closed, Not long divisible.'
The maid servant knelt down before the blaze and held up with extended arms one of the habiliments of the Juno upstairs, from which a cloud of steam began to rise.
Neither had spoken since they left the roadway till she said, with attempted unconcern: 'This is unfortunate.'
But, as the rain gave not the least sign of cessation, he observed: 'I think we shall have to go back.'
However, if you are determined I will show you the way.
But, loving her or not, he perceived that the spirit, emanation, idealism, which called itself his Love was flitting stealthily from some remoter figure to the near one in the chamber overhead.
The 'Island' was an island still.
'You are sleepy, my girl,' said Pierston.
He did not think of her as before.
By the aid of some temporary wraps, and some slippers from the cupboard, he was contriving to make himself comfortable when the maid servant came downstairs with a damp armful of woman's raiment.
The rain fell upon the keel of the old lerret like corn thrown in handfuls by some colossal sower, and darkness set in to its full shade.
At first she seemed not at all disposed to show any candour on her own affairs, and he was left to conjecture as to her history and name, and how she could possibly have known him.
'I should think so!
'He's my father!'
He pitied her, and, while he wondered at it, admired her determination. The houses facing the bay now sheltered them completely, and they reached the vicinity of the new railway terminus (which the station was at this date) without difficulty.
Our house, or rather his, not mine, is at South Kensington.
He again became conscious of the change which had been initiated during the walk.
Pierston withdrew from the fire.
Avice had not kept her engagement to meet him in the lonely ruin, fearing her own imaginings.
'It is more unfortunate for you, perhaps, than for me,' he said, 'and I am very sorry that it should be so.'
I am a real islander-or was, rather....
Now I shall take the train as soon as I reach the mainland.'
First he gave his arm, but the wind tore them apart as easily as coupled cherries.
'Yes.
It meant a possible migration of the Well Beloved.
'My father,' she burst out suddenly, 'is always scolding me for my extravagance!
'Rain or no rain, I can stay no longer,' she said.
'Never!' said she, and the firmness with which she closed her lips was audible in the word.
We have lived there for years.
'Indeed.
'I am not.
'Why not?' he inquired.
He admitted that it was, and found, after a few further remarks had passed, that she certainly had been weeping, there being a suppressed gasp of passionateness in her utterance now and then.
How should I? You are a kimberlin.'
'Yes.
And he has been doing it to day more than ever.
Haven't you heard of the Best Bed Stone Company?'
They had not realized the force of the elements till now.
She replied nothing to this, and he added that it was rather a desolate place for a woman, alone and afoot.
But we have been tenants of Sylvania Castle, on the island here, this season.
Nothing but the frail bank of pebbles divided them from the raging gulf without, and at every bang of the tide against it the ground shook, the shingle clashed, the spray rose vertically, and was blown over their heads.
'Then I have been staying quite near you, Miss Bencomb.
'There are good reasons.'
I don't know.
He doesn't tell me much of his affairs.'
They passed the ruined castle, and having left the island far behind them trod mile after mile till they drew near to the outskirts of the neighbouring watering place.
The Well Beloved was moving house-had gone over to the wearer of this attire.
Then Jocelyn opened proceedings, overhauling the robes and extending them one by one.
The 'night porter' thanked him and left the room, and he soon heard her snoring from the adjoining apartment.
Somewhere about this time-it might have been sooner, it might have been later-he became conscious of a sensation which, in its incipient and unrecognized form, had lurked within him from some unnoticed moment when he was sitting close to his new friend under the lerret.
'But he could afford a much bigger one if he chose.'
'Do come back,' said he, taking her hand.
Her clothing offered more resistance to the wind than his, and she was consequently in the greater danger.
Their application for admission led to the withdrawal of a bolt, and they stood within the gaslight of the passage.
I'll dry the clothing and put the articles here in a heap, which you can take up to the young lady in the morning.'
'Was that this evening?'
I cannot leave you.
--'Twill have no effect, said my father.
--I'll put him, however, into breeches, said my father,--let the world say what it will.
I would shew him publickly, said my uncle Toby, at the market cross.
--Was ever poor devil of a country gentleman so hampered? said my father.
That paper I sent to Mr Trenchard is accepted, and I shall be glad to have your criticism when it comes out; don't spare my style, which needs a great deal of chastening.
If you can't see me, at least let us write to each other.
Dearest Marian, do not cease to think of me as your friend because my brother has disgraced himself.
I have been thinking: couldn't you use your holiday in Sark for a story?
'For the present we cannot see each other, but I am very far from wishing that our friendship should come to an end.
It was written with undisturbed kindness of feeling, but in few words.
Several days passed before there came a reply.
And much more of the same tenor.
"Dresden!" echoed Polly, sitting quite straight with very red cheeks;--"oh, Jasper!"
But up came another boy.
"That's my third letter, Polly," announced Jasper, on the other side of the table. "Now, I am going to begin on Joel's."
mr King thought so, too, and he beamed at Phronsie.
"And hurry," cried Polly and Jasper, together, after him.
"Tom, see here!"
"All right," said Polly, glad to think there was anything she could really do to please the little old earl, "but would your mother like it, Tom?" She stopped slowly in putting her unfinished letter into the little writing case, and looked at him.
twenty four
She's got lots of fun in her, and she always sees the sense of a thing."
Then his face brightened, and he said, "And she's right, Polly," while Polly fished a franc out of Joel's little money bag that hung at her belt.
"Oh, Tom Selwyn," gasped Polly, looking up over Phronsie's head, "you don't suppose we'd let that letter go."
"But she's so nice," breathed Polly, who greatly admired mrs Selwyn, "and so elegant."
"He took it out," said Adela, for the first time finding her tongue.
And then to post it.
That night in the market place at Martigny, Jasper, who was ahead with his father, ran back to Polly, and the others lingering behind.
"I wouldn't feel so badly, Polly," he managed to whisper, when Phronsie was absorbed with her work; "he'll like it probably just as father did the gingerbread boy."
"O dear me!" cried Polly, aghast.
And she gave the bag a little pat for Joel's sake, wishing it was his stubby black hair that her fingers could touch.
Tom Selwyn had been very sober during all this merry chatter; and now in his seat across the narrow aisle, he drummed his heels impatiently on the floor.
"The very thing!" exclaimed Tom, striking his hand so heavily on the table, that for a minute it looked as if the ink bottle hopped.
Phronsie, who hadn't heard what Polly said, her small head being full of the responsibility of beginning the important letter, and considering, since it was to be done, it was best to have it over with as soon as possible, fell to scribbling the letters as fast as she could, all of them running down hill.
"I really would, Phronsie dear, to please her."
"O dear, my stamps are all gone," said Polly, peering into the little box in one corner of her writing case.
Tom's mouth trembled.
"You know she did, Jasper."
Just look at her face."
"O dear me!" exclaimed Adela, as her scissors slipped, "now you've joggled the table again!" Then she caught Polly's eye.
"Now, Phronsie, I think you would better begin, for you are the littlest," and she flapped the long strip down in front of her.
"What's up, little mother?" asked Tom, in surprise, at her unusual manner.
And Jasper running in, the table was soon surrounded by the makers of the Round Robin, Adela deserting her sketch book and pulling up a chair.
"Dear me, how the summer is going!" mourned Polly, as they caught on the return journey the last glimpse of the roaring, tumbling Visp, and not all the craning of the necks could compass another view, as the cars drew them away from the rushing river.
"Dare!" said Tom, delighted to think that no terrible result had really ensued from his words, that after they were out, had scared him mightily.
When the news was circulated, as it was pretty soon, that the party was not to be broken into at all till Paris was a completed story, the jubilation was such as to satisfy even Tom.
"And let's get to work," cried Jasper, huddling up his three letters. "I'll post yours, too, Polly; give them here."
"Rather not-much obliged," Tom bobbed his thanks.
"See those boys; now they are going to make trouble."
"The Louvre!" cried Adela; "O dear me, Polly Pepper."
Phronsie, there, there, don't cry.
Tom bobbed his head and accepted this as a matter of course.
See, Polly." She was trimming the third strip of paper, for the Round Robin was to be pasted together and rolled up when it was all done.
Tom bobbed his head, not allowing himself to exclaim, "But that will be only a short journey, now, and we must soon say 'good by.'"
"It's all right.
"Then I shall be all as well as ever," said Polly, kissing the wet little face.
"I want to write, too, I do," she cried, very much excited.
"Ever so much like it," said Tom.
"It isn't borrowing," said Jasper, turning back slowly.
"Of course, you shall, Pet.
"But that was different," groaned Polly.
"I'm going to write you one now," declared Phronsie.
"But I didn't say 'Round Robin,'" persisted Tom, "wasn't smart enough to think of it."
And Jasper and Polly rushed up to date with their journals, and wrote letters home; and Adela worked up her studies and sketches.
"All right, seeing you wish it so," said Jasper, with a keen look at him, "and these are beauties and no mistake; we couldn't begin to equal them."
"Yes, she did," said Jasper, uncomfortably.
"Why," said Polly, finding her tongue, "we wouldn't dare, Tom Selwyn."
"I don't see how you got so many," said Jasper, in admiration, his fingers busy with the heap.
"I'm glad we have any," hummed Polly, happily.
When the letter was finally unrolled and read to Grandpapa, who strayed into the reading room to see what Phronsie was doing, it certainly was a beauty.
"Isn't it nice to think they do?"
Picture after picture, cut from railroad guide books, illustrated papers, and it seemed to Jasper gathered as if by magic, with cunning little photographs, broke up the letter, and wound in and out with funny and charming detail of some of their journey.
"Aren't those pictures pretty?" she burst out awkwardly.
"Oh, Polly, you begin," begged Tom.
"I'll give them to you, Polly."
"It's dreadfully thin paper," said Adela, critically, getting off from the sofa to pick at one corner of the sheet Polly was beginning to divide.
"But Polly wants you to," said Jasper.
"That's the very reason she understands things like a shot-and knows how to take 'em," he said; "and I tell you, Polly," he declared with a burst of confidence that utterly surprised him, "I'd rather have my mother than any other company I know of; she's awful good fun!"
"It's just this, Tom.
Polly looked up quickly, her pen dropping from her fingers, and Jasper deserted his fourth letter and stared.
"Thank your stars you have," said Tom, as gaily.
"And you'll go on drawing and painting until you get to be a great artist," ran on Polly, enthusiastically, "and then we'll see something you've done, in the Louvre, maybe."
"Filched 'em out of the old woman's room," he said.
"Oh, do hurry," he begged, "it's the prettiest sight!"
"We might," said Polly, slowly, "write a letter, all of us.
Do you please finish it, Jasper."
At that Polly began to have little "creeps" as she always called the shivers.
"Never you fear," cried Tom, seizing the Round Robin; and waving it over his head, it trailed off back of him like a very long and broad ribbon.
"Any room here, Tom, for mother?" she said.
But the ring of girls paid no more attention to him, than they had to any other outside matters, being wholly absorbed in the game.
"I wrote that all myself," hummed Phronsie, smoothing her gown, in great satisfaction, pointing to the opening of the letter.
"So you did," he cried; "now that's fine.
"I won't cry any more," declared Phronsie, wiping off the last tear trailing down her nose.
"Oh, Tom!" began Polly.
THE ROUND ROBIN
"I want to donate something to granddaddy, and I tell you I'm something awful at a letter."
Phronsie lifted her head where she had burrowed it under Polly's arm. When she saw that Polly's round cheeks were really quite pale, she stopped crying at once.
"But Mamsie said when we started I should get my stamps when I needed them," said Polly.
"Now, this is comfy," observed mrs Selwyn, as the train sped on.
And the urchin laughed too, thinking this much better fun to tussle with the tall lad, than to hang around a parcel of girls.
He's got lots of fun in him," he added.
"Take care!" cried Jasper, as he ran after with Polly and Adela, "if you dare to tear that, sir!" while Phronsie at the big table laboured away on her letter, Grandpapa sitting by to watch the proceedings, with the greatest interest.
I wish you'd write me a letter sometime."
"O dear me, I can't cut it straight.
There, in the centre of the market place, was a ring of little girls, hand in hand, singing a little French song, and going round and round in a circle.
"No, I think Phronsie ought to," said Polly, shaking her head.
"Yes, I do," said Adela, "and I've got some sketches to take back, and Mademoiselle will be glad of that."
"O dear me!" exclaimed Polly, softly, for she couldn't even yet get over that dreadful beginning.
"Oh, no, Jasper," cried Polly, after him, "you know Mamsie would not allow me to borrow."
"That's three times that boy has gone out," announced Adela, "and he joggles the table awfully when he starts.
"One, two," said Polly, counting, "why, I thought I'd written three; well, this one is most finished, Jasper."
"Oh, if you knew granddaddy!" And he sank into a chair by the table, and played with the heap of picture postal cards that Polly was going to address next.
It will cheer him up."
"I would," said Tom, coolly, running his hands in his pockets.
And then it struck me I'd make a book like yours."
"Well, let's leave our letters to day, Polly, and set to on the Round Robin."
"O dear me, how could I say anything?" cried Polly, overcome with remorse and patting Phronsie's yellow hair; "but it is so very dreadful.
"Well, I'm sorry the summer is going," said Adela, "because then I've got to leave you at Paris, and go into school."
"I want Polly to," said Phronsie, wriggling away from the pen that Polly held out alluringly.
Hear them jeer!" And his long arm went out and picked a jacket end of an urchin, who, incautiously regarding such quiet travellers as not worth minding, had hovered too near, while trying to tease the girls.
"You don't know my mother," exclaimed Tom, "if you think she won't like that.
"I'll fetch Phronsie," cried Tom, springing off.
When number three put in an appearance, she gave up all hope at once.
"And Phronsie must come," said Polly, snipping away to get the paper the right width.
"O dear me!" she exclaimed again, and turned quite pale.
"I know!" ejaculated Tom, whirling on his heel, and dashing out.
"Oh! isn't it 'Oats, Peas, Beans, and Barley grow'?" cried Polly, as they watched them intently.
"That's all right," said Jasper, squinting at it critically, "only-just this edge wants a little bit of trimming, Polly." And he snipped off the offending points.
She spoke so sharply that Phronsie started, and a little drop of ink trembling on the point of her pen concluded to hop off.
"They're jealous chaps," cried Tom, "and are vexed because they can't get into the game!
O dear me!
"Come on, now, all fall into line!"
"Oh, see what she's written!" cried Polly, quite aghast, and tumbling into her chair, she pointed at the top.
"Do," cried old mr King, in great satisfaction.
"So we could," cried Jasper; "how would that do, Tom?"
"Well, I'm glad to see that we haven't made any mistake," cried Polly, turning back in relief.
Then she thought of what Mamsie had said, and slackened her speed.
I'm no good in a letter." And again he rushed from the room.
"I know it," said Polly, brightly, with a little answering smile. "Well, I hope she'll like it."
"Wait a minute, Phronsie!" exclaimed Polly, in dismay, "I believe we've made a mistake, Jasper, and got the wrong sheet." And Polly turned off with him to examine the rest of the paper.
"Polly, you always do think of the best things!" exclaimed Jasper, beaming at her, which made her try harder than ever to smile.
"Are you sick, Polly?" she asked, in great concern.
"Then you can overcome your dislike to Paris enough to go there?" asked his mother, with a little twinkle in her eye.
O dear me!"
To please Polly, being what Phronsie longed for next to pleasing Mamsie, she gave a small sigh and took the pen in unsteady fingers.
So Polly and the others breathed freely again.
And he made me cut clear into that edge.
"I've plenty," said Jasper, hurrying off; "I'll stick on two for you."
"My mother says," he announced in triumph, "that father will get no end of fun over that if you let it go.
And one look at mrs Selwyn's face, as she read that Round Robin, was enough for Polly!
Since Grandpapa wanted anything, it was never too soon to begin work on it.
"Oh, Phronsie, you haven't begun!"
In came Tom with a rush, and turned a small box he held in his hand upside down on the table.
That man stands before you!
He got laws passed for them; he got Sunday Schools established wherever he could.
"So this poor little boy grew up to be a man, and had to go out in the world, far from home and friends to earn his living.
Elderly people directed each other's attention and, said, "There! that's him, with the grand, noble forehead!" Boys nudged each other and said, "Hi, Johnny, here he is, there, that's him, with the peeled head!"
Always love your teachers, my children, for they love you more than you can know, now.
When Senator Dilworthy departed from Cattleville, he left three dozen boys behind him arranging a campaign of life whose objective point was the United States Senate.
That poor little boy that loved his Sunday School became that man.
CHAPTER fifty three.
no
no
Am I in some strange foreign clime where the children are marvels that we know not of?
no
They all made complimentary reference to "their friend the Senator," and told what a great and illustrious man he was and what he had done for his country and for religion and temperance, and exhorted the little boys to be good and diligent and try to become like him some day.
The Senator now turned his attention to matters touching the souls of his people.
I ask you, my little friends, What did my consciousness reply?
It replied, It is the temple of the Lord!
When the Senator arrived the Church was crowded, the windows were full, the aisles were packed, so was the vestibule, and so indeed was the yard in front of the building.
"Well, this poor little boy was always in his place when the bell rang, and he always knew his lesson; for his teachers wanted him to learn and he loved his teachers dearly.
Above all things, my children, be honest.
no
Then he smiled with an access of sweetness upon the children and began:
After mr Noble was gone, the Senator said:
By and by he was elected to the legislature-Then he did everything he could for Sunday Schools.
"After a while the people elected him a Representative to the Congress of the United States, and he grew very famous.--Now temptations assailed him on every hand.
Is it some other vain, brilliant, beautiful temple of soul staining amusement and hilarity?
"Again I thought, Is this a theatre?
"Children, honor your parents and be grateful to them for providing for you the precious privileges of a Sunday School.
The Senator wrought in Bible classes, and nothing could keep him away from the Sunday Schools-neither sickness nor storms nor weariness.
He loved the Sunday School.
And I humbly thank Him to whom we are but as worms of the dust, that he has been pleased to call me to serve such men!
By supper time to morrow you'll be re-elected.
You can go to bed and sleep easy on that."
Temptations lay all about him, and sometimes he was about to yield, but he would think of some precious lesson he learned in his Sunday School a long time ago, and that would save him.
What did my consciousness reply?
That is right!
There was one little bad boy who was always trying to persuade him, but he never could.
Senator Dilworthy thought he would run out west and shake hands with his constituents and let them look at him.
The session was drawing toward its close.
no
He finally sent the man away at three o'clock one morning; and when he was gone, mr Dilworthy said to himself,
"And by and by the people made him governor-and he said it was all owing to the Sunday School.
The Sunday School children occupied ten of the front benches dressed in their best and most uncomfortable clothes, and with hair combed and faces too clean to feel natural.
The University bill was safe, now; he could leave it without fear; it needed his presence and his watching no longer.
Is it a concert or a gilded opera?
"I feel a good deal relieved, now, a great deal relieved."
And what do you think it was?
The usual Sunday School exercises were hurried through, and then the minister, got up and bored the house with a speech built on the customary Sunday School plan; then the Superintendent put in his oar; then the town dignitaries had their say.
I have been asking myself as I sat here, Where am I? Am I in some far off monarchy, looking upon little princes and princesses?
Then what is it?
He would not let bad boys persuade him to go to play on Sunday.
The Senator took his seat in the pulpit, with the minister on one side of him and the Superintendent of the Sunday School on the other.
mr Dilworthy took an early opportunity to send for mr Noble; he had a midnight interview with him, and urged him to forsake his evil ways; he begged him to come again and again, which he did.
Then where am I? Yes-where am I? I am in a simple, remote, unpretending settlement of my own dear State, and these are the children of the noble and virtuous men who have made me what I am!
Why the people gave him a towering, illustrious position, a grand, imposing position.
Above all things be pure minded as the snow.
Earth has no higher, no grander position for me. Let kings and emperors keep their tinsel crowns, I want them not; my heart is here!
After that they began to come to themselves by degrees, and presently the spell was wholly gone and they were reciting verses and pulling hair.
Am I in some populous centre of my own country, where the choicest children of the land have been selected and brought together as at a fair for a prize? no
It was Senator of the United States!
I could hardly keep the tears back, I was so grateful.
To them a United States Senator was a vast, vague colossus, an awe inspiring unreality.
He further said that if this Noble were a pure man, and merely misguided, he could bear it, but that he should succeed in his wicked designs through a base use of money would leave a blot upon his State which would work untold evil to the morals of the people, and that he would not suffer; the public morals must not be contaminated.
Noble was working hard, too, but matters were against him, he was not making much progress.
People tried to get him to drink wine; to dance, to go to theatres; they even tried to buy his vote; but no, the memory of his Sunday School saved him from all harm; he remembered the fate of the bad little boy who used to try to get him to play on Sunday, and who grew up and became a drunkard and was hanged.
Let us join in prayer."
So awed were they by the presence of a living United States Senator, that during three minutes not a "spit ball" was thrown.
"I've worked hard, and I've got them at last.
They could not give him a costly education; but they were good and wise and they sent him to the Sunday School.
The speakers won the deathless hatred of the house by these delays, but at last there was an end and hope revived; inspiration was about to find utterance.
My soul is lost in wonder at the thought!
"Well, at last, what do you think happened?
The legislature whose duty it would be to re elect him to the United States Senate, was already in session.
What should you say it was, children?
They were just going to turn away; but they didn't, for that angry thump happened to be the best thing they could have done.
The mother had died not long ago, and left twelve year old Tessa to take care of the little children.
Freddy, bring me your mittens; these poor hands must be covered.
Tessa felt very rich as she crept under the faded counterpane, feeling as if she had received a lovely gift, and fell happily asleep with chubby Ranza in her arms, and the two rough black heads peeping out at the foot of the bed.
I like this very much; and now it is not hard.'
What happy little souls they were that morning; and when they were quiet again, how like a fairy tale did Tessa's story sound to them. Ranza was quite ready to be an angel; and the boys promised to be marvellously good, if they were only allowed to see the tree at the 'palace,' as they called the great house.
'Mamma says, come to the door; it's too muddy to throw the money into the street!' cried out a kindly child's voice as Tessa held up the old cap, with beseeching eyes.
All of a sudden a little head appeared at the window, as if the sound had brought it; then another and another, till there were five, of all heights and colors, and five eager faces peeped out, smiling and nodding to the two below.
But she had made half a dollar, for Tommo divided the money fairly, and she felt rich with her share.
'Tommo will like to have me go with him and sing, while he plays his harp in the streets.
She dreamed wonderful dreams that night, and woke in the morning to find real wonders before her eyes.
It was a happy night: and all their lives they remembered it as something too beautiful and bright to be quite true.
Quick! quick!' cried Tommo, twanging away with all his might, and showing his white teeth, as he smiled back at the little gentle folk.
Just as Tessa's tears began to tumble off her eyelashes on to her brown cheeks, the cricket began to chirp.
She tried to be very wise and motherly, and worked for them like any little woman; but it was so hard to keep the small bodies warm and fed, and the small souls good and happy, that poor Tessa was often at her wits' end.
Four socks, instead of three; and by the fourth, pinned out quite elegantly was a little dress, evidently meant for her-a warm, woollen dress, all made, and actually with bright buttons on it.
'But see, then, it is cold in the streets; the wind bites, and the snow freezes one's fingers.
I assure you, it was splendid; the great tree glittering with lights and gifts; and, on her invisible perch, up among the green boughs, sat the little golden haired angel, all in white, with downy wings, a shining crown on her head, and the most serene satisfaction in her blue eyes, as she stretched her chubby arms to those below, and smiled her baby smile at them.
'My mother.
In her long stocking she found all sorts of treasures; for Tommo had stuffed it full of queer things, and his mother had made gingerbread into every imaginable shape, from fat pigs to full omnibuses.
As the door opened, Tessa saw what looked to her like a fairy feast,--all silver mugs and flowery plates and oranges and nuts and rosy wine in tall glass pitchers, and smoking dishes that smelt so deliciously she could not restrain a little sniff of satisfaction.
Bless us!
Alice, get your play hood; this handkerchief is all wet; and, Maud, bring the old chinchilla tippet.'
She tied a bright scarlet handkerchief over the old hood, and the brilliant color set off her brown cheeks and bright eyes, as well as the pretty black braids of her hair.
Little Tessa sat alone by the fire, waiting for her father to come home from work.
As soon as her father was gone, Tessa flew about and put everything in nice order, telling the children she was going out for the day, and they were to mind Tommo's mother, who would see about the fire and the dinner; for the good woman loved Tessa, and entered into her little plans with all her heart.
At dusk they went home, Tessa so hoarse she could hardly speak, and so tired she fell asleep over her supper.
I have no way to say "thank you;" but Ranza shall be for you a heavenly angel, and I will sing my heart out for your tree!' cried Tessa, folding the mittens as if she would say a prayer of thankfulness if she knew how.
'Are you hungry?' asked the boy, in a grand tone.
Dear me!
'I say, mamma; she wants something to eat.
They like my music, and often give me sips of hot coffee, which I like much.
Can I give her an orange?' called the boy, prancing away into the splendid room, quite like a fairy prince, Tessa thought.
The children laughed, and clapped their hands, and cried 'More! more!
'Sit down and warm yourself, and tell me about Ranza,' said the kind elder sister, who liked the confiding little girl, in spite of her shabby clothes.
The other days were very much like this; sometimes they made more, sometimes less, but Tommo always 'went halves;' and Tessa kept on, in spite of cold and weariness, for her plans grew as her earnings increased, and now she hoped to get useful things, instead of candy and toys alone.
At the fourth, some people let them sing all their songs and gave nothing.
I'll do it! if father will let me,' she said to herself, smiling and nodding at the fire.
'If I could have a tree for the children, I'd never want anything again. But I can't; so I'll fill the socks all full, and be happy,' said Tessa, as she looked wistfully into the gay stores, and saw the heavy baskets go by.
When she had told her plan, peter Benari shook his head, and thought it would never do; but Tessa begged so hard, he consented at last that she should try it for one week, and sent her to bed the happiest little girl in New York.
She sewed up the holes in her shoes as well as she could, for she had much of that sort of cobbling to do; she mended her only gown, and laid ready the old hood and shawl which had been her mother's.
Up the wide stone steps went the street musicians, and the whole flock came running down to give a handful of silver, and ask all sorts of questions.
She thanked Tommo, and ran away to get ready, for she felt sure her father would not refuse her anything.
'Give these to your brothers,' said the fairy prince, stuffing nuts and oranges into Tessa's hands.
The little mother kept nothing for herself but the pleasure of giving everything away; yet, I think, she was both richer and happier than if she had kept them all.
Sing another, little girl!
It was rather a dirty hand, but so kind that Tessa clung to it, and kept looking up at the friendly brown face for encouragement.
Tommo's mother lent her a pair of boots so big that they turned up at the toes, but there were no holes in them, and Tessa felt quite elegant in whole boots.
'You have a charming voice, child.
The lady understood her, and stroked her cheek softly, saying to her elder daughter, 'We must take care of this good little creature.
How gay the streets were that day! how brisk every one was, and how bright the faces looked, as people trotted about with big baskets, holly wreaths, and young evergreens going to blossom into splendid Christmas trees!
She is dead now; but I do not forget,' answered Tessa, in her pretty broken English.
Mamma and Miss Rose drilled them all; and when the folding doors flew open, one rapturous 'Oh!' arose from the crowd of children gathered to the festival.
She got up early, to see if the socks were all right, and there she found the most astonishing sight.
So full of her plan was Tessa that she ran upstairs at once, and asked Tommo if he would take her with him on the morrow.
Next morning the sun shone, but the cold wind blew, and the snow lay thick in the streets.
But what can I do, so small and stupid and shy as I am?
'Yes, sir,' meekly answered Tessa.
All the afternoon the two friends wandered about, singing and playing, and gathering up their small harvest.
Tessa's father was an Italian plaster worker, very poor, but kind and honest.
'O Rose! let us see the little girl; and if she will do, let us have her, and Tessa can learn our song, and it will be splendid!' cried the biggest boy, who sat astride of a chair, and stared at the harp with round eyes.
Yes, I will try; and then, if I do well, the little ones shall have a Merry Christmas.'
The next three houses were empty; and the last of all showed not a single face as they looked up anxiously.
'I do not mind cold and wet, and cross people, if I can get the pennies,' answered Tessa, feeling very brave with such a friend to help her.
The day is very long, people are cross, and at night one is ready to die with weariness.
'I'll ask mamma,' said Rose; and away she went into the dining room close by.
'I wish she could sing at our tree, since Bella is ill,' cried one of the children peeping through the banisters.
'Oh, so much!' exclaimed Tessa; adding eagerly, 'my sister Ranza is small and pretty as a baby angel.
No; she had a fine plan in her good little head, and was trying to discover how she could carry it out.
I know many songs, and may get money if I am not frightened; for people throw pennies to other little girls who only play the tambourine.
Tessa felt so grateful that, without waiting for Tommo, she sang her sweetest little song all alone.
You see, Christmas was coming in a week; and she had set her heart on putting something in the children's stockings, as the mother used to do, for while she lived things were comfortable.
'Will you come, too, and bring your harp?
At the first house, a cross old gentleman flapped his newspaper at them; at the second, a young gentleman and lady were so busy talking that they never turned their heads, and at the third, a servant came out and told them to go away, because some one was sick.
One fat old Frenchman nodded to her, and it seemed to help her very much; for she began to sing before she thought, and that was the hardest part of it.
She longed to make the beds and dress the children over night, she was in such a hurry to have all in order; but, as that could not be, she sat down again, and tried over all the songs she knew.
Little Ranza was accepted with delight by the kind lady and her children, and Tessa learned the song quite easily.
Tessa walked more quietly, and rubbed her cold hands, feeling that the world was a very big place, and wondering how the children got on at home without the little mother.
How Tessa did tune up at that!
What inclined Eugenius to the same opinion was as follows:
A few hours before Yorick breathed his last, Eugenius stept in with an intent to take his last sight and last farewell of him.
Alas, poor Yorick!
The Mortgager and Mortgagee differ the one from the other, not more in length of purse, than the Jester and Jestee do, in that of memory.
Interest, however, still runs on in both cases;--the periodical or accidental payments of it, just serving to keep the memory of the affair alive; till, at length, in some evil hour, pop comes the creditor upon each, and by demanding principal upon the spot, together with full interest to the very day, makes them both feel the full extent of their obligations.
--But mine, indeed, is a particular case-
what's the matter?
Now hang it!

So without arguing the matter further with Thomas o'Becket, or any one else-I skip'd into the boat, and in five minutes we got under sail, and scudded away like the wind.

The town house seems to be but a sorry building, and not to be kept in the best repair; otherwise it had been a second great ornament to this place; it answers however its destination, and serves very well for the reception of the magistrates, who assemble in it from time to time; so that 'tis presumable, justice is regularly distributed.
Sick! sick!

And all that we require of the Earl of Mangelwurzelshire is that he should have fifty thousand a year and hunt the country.' O you pride of all Snobland!
PUNCH, will you PLEASE give us a short answer in your next number, and I will be SO much obliged to you.
To this I reply in the following manner:--'My dear young ladies, I know your post town: and shall be at church there the Sunday AFTER next; when, will you please to wear a tulip or some little trifle in your bonnets, so that I may know you?

CHAPTER twenty one-SOME CONTINENTAL SNOBS
They will be at Ostend in four hours; they will inundate the Continent next week; they will carry into far lands the famous image of the British Snob.
I told you he would.
That overgrown lady with the four daughters, and the young dandy from the University, her son, is mrs Kewsy, the eminent barrister's lady, who would rather die than not be in the fashion.
Now that September has come, and all our Parliamentary duties are over, perhaps no class of Snobs are in such high feather as the Continental Snobs.
But she will exact and receive considerable respect from the British Snobs located in the watering place which she selects for her summer residence, being the daughter of the Earl of Haggistoun.
Faugh! the old brute!
What rings and chains, what gold headed canes and diamonds, what a tuft the rogue has got to his chin (the rogue! he will never spare himself any cheap enjoyment!) Little Houndsditch has a little cane with a gilt head and little mosaic ornaments-altogether an extra air.

But can it be true that I am in Moscow?
But I shall spare her.
"But, gentlemen..."
The faces of those who were not conferring together were pale and perturbed.
Meanwhile an agitated consultation was being carried on in whispers among his generals and marshals at the rear of his suite.
The position was the more awkward because the Emperor, meditating upon his magnanimous plans, was pacing patiently up and down before the outspread map, occasionally glancing along the road to Moscow from under his lifted hand with a bright and proud smile.
"Yet here she is lying at my feet, with her golden domes and crosses scintillating and twinkling in the sunshine.
He was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended to adopt toward Moscow.
But my clemency is always ready to descend upon the vanquished.
But no, it can't be true that I am in Moscow," he suddenly thought.
On the ancient monuments of barbarism and despotism I will inscribe great words of justice and mercy....
Some said that a deputation of some sort must be scraped together, others disputed that opinion and maintained that the Emperor should first be carefully and skillfully prepared, and then told the truth.
CHAPTER nineteen
I do not wish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an honored monarch.
Pierre went into that gloomy study which he had entered with such trepidation in his benefactor's lifetime.
There was no one in the passage.
Let us go in..." said Pierre and entered the house.
Gerasim opened one of the shutters and left the room on tiptoe.
This is how it happened.
CHAPTER eighteen
The room, dusty and untouched since the death of Joseph Bazdeev was now even gloomier.
The hall porter was standing at the front door.
This was the authentic Scotch Acts with Bazdeev's notes and explanations.
"Oh yes!" said Pierre, rousing himself and rising hurriedly.
In Moscow they are saying heaven knows what about him....
The habits of the military class are the absence of freedom, that is, discipline, idleness, ignorance, cruelty, debauchery, and drunkenness.
And if you like I will tell you that whatever happens and whatever muddles those at the top may make, we shall win tomorrow's battle.
One picture succeeded another in his imagination.
The officers rose.
They are only concerned with their own petty interests."
And then the determination of the troops would be quite different.
"However, you're sleepy, and it's time for me to sleep.
"But on what then?"
In my opinion they are all criminals.
We play at magnanimity and all that stuff.
Since they are my foes they cannot be my friends, whatever may have been said at Tilsit."
We ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously.
"There now, your excellency!
How can I explain?...
"Well, then, you know more than anyone else, be it who it may," said Prince Andrew.
"I was very glad of his appointment, that's all I know," replied Prince Andrew.

And so thinks Timokhin and the whole army.

"On the feeling that is in me and in him," he pointed to Timokhin, "and in each soldier."
Now we see light..."
"So you understand the whole position of our troops?" Prince Andrew interrupted him.
Tomorrow, happen what may, we shall win!"

The dwarf's tastes, however, were catholic.
The hot pipes and smouldering matches stained the table tops and burnt the carpets, so that they had the option of abandoning either the pipe or the quarters.
Later his tobacco, combined with insolence to his tobacco hating colonel, conducted him out of the army into the retirement of civil life; and so on and so on.
That was reserved for the secluded apartment after the ladies had gone to bed.
Of course, in those days no one ever thought of smoking a pipe in the presence of ladies."
It is a great soother, a pleasant comforter.
George Fitz Boodle recounts how, as a boy, he was flogged for smoking, and how, at Oxford, smoking among other villainies led to his rustication.
"Now, mrs Quilp," he says, "I feel in a smoking humour, and shall probably blaze away all night.
Carlyle, as every one knows, was a great smoker.
He is churchwarden at home, and can't smoke anything but a long clay," with which the old sailor was accordingly supplied.

EARLY VICTORIAN DAYS
The pipe is a feature in all illustrations of Cogerian meetings."
Benson.
The growth of cigar smoking was rapid.
This must have been before eighteen forty one, when Sir Astley died.
The period covered by this chapter included both the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny, and every one knows how the soldiers in the Crimea and in India alike craved for tobacco as for one of the greatest of luxuries, and how even an occasional smoke cheered and encouraged and sustained suffering humanity.
In more fashionable circles the mere possession of a pipe might be looked at askance.
The vulgar thing falls upon the floor, and Tom is ashamed to claim his property and so acknowledge his ownership of a pipe.
Germany has been puffing for three score years; France smokes to a man.
Another correspondent of the same journal, Colonel w f
University men used to be rather particular about the pipes they smoked.
The Duke's prejudices were stronger than his facts.
Kingsley's devotion to smoke seems to have surprised Tennyson, who was no light smoker himself.
Consequently, men had either to indulge in the practice out of doors, or else, as you say, sneak away to the kitchen when the servants had gone to bed, and puff up the chimney.
Old customs die hard with Cogers, and they stuck to their pipe....
