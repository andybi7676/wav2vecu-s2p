come hither come hither my handsome son and let me comb your hair for you
so cinderlad told him whence he came and that he was brother to the two who had watched the seven foals for the king and then he inquired if he might be allowed to try to watch them on the following day
so when he had walked the whole day he too came to the kings palace as darkness began to fall
it was all but dark when they got back to the king at nightfall and he himself was standing in the courtyard waiting for them
yes that is where we are to go in said the foal
so they journeyed onwards a good bit farther
when he had run thus for a long time he too came to the cleft in the rock
hast thou watched well and faithfully the whole day said the king to cinderlad
dost thou see anything
they only just managed to live from hand to mouth and had great difficulty in doing even so much as that but they had three sons and the youngest of them was called cinderlad for he did nothing else but lie and poke about among the ashes
when the foals got into the churchyard they turned into men and looked like the sons of a king and their clothes were so magnificent that they shone with splendour and they went into the church and received bread and wine from the priest who was standing before the altar and cinderlad went in too
dost thou see anything now
i am walking about in search of a place said cinderlad
no said cinderlad
then the king knew how his watching had been done and fell into such a rage that he ordered his people to chase the youth back to his own home at once but first they were to cut three red stripes in his back and rub salt into them
yes that i have said the youth
he had a fancy to try to watch the seven foals himself he said
there the old hag was once more sitting spinning from her distaff and she cried to cinderlad
one day the eldest lad said that he would go out to earn his living he soon got leave to do that and set out on his way into the world
when the youth reached home again anyone can imagine what a state of mind he was in
that is a river said the foal and we have to cross it
oh no said the lad
cinderlad promised to do this and then they went on farther
so they travelled onwards again for many and many a mile over hill and dale
the seven foals
there stood the king outside on the steps and he asked whither he was bound
in the grey light of dawn the master of the horse let out the seven foals and off they went again over hill and dale and off went the lad after them
he walked on and on for the whole day and when night was beginning to fall he came to a royal palace
now then said the foal dost thou not see anything now
yes diligently and faithfully hast thou watched said the king and thou shalt have the princess and half the kingdom
canst thou wield that sword asked the foal
the two brothers laughed at him and his father and mother begged him not to go but all to no purpose and cinderlad set out on his way
when they had travelled a long long way the foal said
here you see their meat and here you see their drink
i have done my best replied cinderlad
when he had run after the foals for a long long time and was hot and tired he passed by a cleft in the rock where an old woman was sitting spinning with a distaff and she called to him
no said cinderlad
on the third day cinderlad wanted to set out
alas no said cinderlad
cinderlad tried but could not do it so he had to take a draught from the pitcher and then one more and after that still another and then he was able to wield the sword with perfect ease
so they went on a great distance farther
the two others laughed at him and mocked him
and thus they journeyed onwards a long long way
so all was made ready for the wedding and the king said that it was to be so stately and magnificent that everyone should hear of it and everyone inquire about it
yes i will go too said cinderlad for i have taken it into my head
but all went with him as it had gone with his brother
as soon as she caught sight of the youth who was running after the foals till the perspiration streamed down his face she cried
when evening was drawing near the youth wanted to go
and now inquired the foal seest thou nothing now
then he threw a lock of wool into the river and when it floated down against the sword it was cut into two pieces
but sigurd waited till half of him had crawled over the pit and then he thrust the sword gram right into his very heart
but a day or two later his tutor said to sigurd there is a great treasure of gold hidden not far from here and it would become you to win it
sigurd tried this blade on the lump of iron and it did not break but split the iron in two
then sigurd went down into that deep place and dug many pits in it and in one of the pits he lay hidden with his sword drawn
and he hammered and wrought them into a new sword so sharp that fire seemed to burn along its edges
but it brought good luck to nobody
so gunnar and brynhild were married though it was not gunnar but sigurd in gunnars shape that had ridden the fire
high over hindfell red fire is flaming there doth the maiden dwell she that should love thee well meet for thy taming
because it is so old and so beautiful the story is told here again but it has a sad endingindeed it is all sad and all about fighting and killing as might be expected from the danes
then gunnar tried sigurds horse grani but he would not move with gunnar on his back
then brynhild saw the ring which sigard had given to gudrun and she knew it and knew all and she turned as pale as a dead woman and went home
but he said no his luck was gone his sword was broken and he must die
then gudrun wakened and saw him dead and she moaned aloud and brynhild heard her and laughed but the kind horse grani lay down and died of very grief
once upon a time there was a king in the north who had won many wars but now he was old
then he took the helmet off the head of the sleeper and behold she was a most beautiful lady
another sword he made and sigurd broke that too
sigurd chose him his name was grani and he came of sleipnirs breed and was the best horse in the world
then immediately he understood the language of birds and he heard the woodpeckers say
sigurd said
but in the night when the battle was over his young wife came out and searched for him among the slain and at last she found him and asked whether he might be healed
so he treated her royally and as time went on she had a son called sigurd a beautiful boy and very strong
so this was done and they hid in a wood but there some strangers met them and carried them off in a ship to denmark
then sigurd was so grieved and his heart so swelled in his breast that it burst the steel rings of his shirt of mail
for her husband she said had ridden through the flame when no other man dared face it
then the person who had killed otter went down and caught the dwarf who owned all the treasure and took it from him
when sigurd heard the story he said to regin
but it chanced that he touched it with his finger and it burned him
and his wife called her maid to her and said let us change clothes and you shall be called by my name and i by yours lest the enemy finds us
this curse came upon her when the thorn of the tree of sleep ran into her hand long ago as a punishment because she had displeased odin the god
long ago too she had vowed never to marry a man who knew fear and dared not ride through the fence of flaming fire
then the old man said drive all the horses into the river and choose the one that swims across
and then brynhild fell a weeping till her heart broke
now there was at that time a dwarf called andvari who lived in a pool beneath a waterfall and there he had hidden a great hoard of gold
the fourth bird said
and she said
they have carved on the rocks pictures of some of the things that happen in the tale and those carvings may still be seen
make me a good sword that i may kill this dragon
then the otter skin was filled with gold and covered with gold all but one hair and that was covered with the poor dwarfs last ring
it is too late
and when they were brought before the king he thought the maid looked like a queen and the queen like a maid
so sigurd said that sword would do
the old king went out and fought bravely but at last his sword broke and he was wounded and his men fled
there lies regin ready to betray sigurd who trusts him
and when the wedding was over and all the feast then the magic of the witchs wine went out of sigurds brain and he remembered all
then sigurd rode away and he came to the house of a king who had a fair daughter
and the wind bore it blazing out to sea flaming into the dark
for sleipnir was the horse of odin the god of the north and was as swift as the wind
the story of sigurd
then his tutor whose name was regin told him that all this great hoard of red gold had once belonged to his own father
but all men die and no brave man lets death frighten him from his desire
thus died sigurd fafnirs bane whom no ten men could have slain in fair fight
sigurd went out and brynhild determined to slay him
then he saw the track which the dragon made when he went to a cliff to drink and the track was as if a great river had rolled along and left a deep valley
i would touch none of it if by losing it i should never die
when he had been at home a few days he rode out with regin one morning to the heath where the dragon used to lie
yet i thought she said that no man could have done this deed but sigurd fafnirs bane who was my true love
there he waited and presently the earth began to shake with the weight of the dragon as he crawled to the water
so sigurd went within the castle door and there he saw someone sleeping clad all in armour
so sigurd put the heart of fafnir on a stake and roasted it
a strange queen to light the fires thought the king
so he asked the queen how do you know in the dark of night whether the hours are wearing to the morning
then the dragon lashed with his tail till stones broke and trees crashed about him
so regin made a sword and sigurd tried it with a blow on a lump of iron and the sword broke
the next bird said
so sigurd drove them and only one swam across
only one ring was left which the dwarf wore and even that was taken from him
all that evening she never spoke
and she said he would never see her glad in his hall never drinking wine never playing chess never embroidering with the golden thread never speaking words of kindness
then he spoke as he died and said
and fafnir had lived in a cave with iron doors a cave dug deep down in the earth and full of gold bracelets and crowns and rings and there too sigurd found the helm of dread a golden helmet and whoever wears it is invisible
and after that sigurd was called fafnirs bane and dragonslayer
all these he piled on the back of the good horse grani and then he rode south to hindfell
then she rent all her needlework asunder and wept aloud so that everyone in the house heard her
now brynhild had no help but to promise she would be his wife the wife of gunnar as she supposed for sigurd wore gunnars shape and she had sworn to wed whoever should ride the flames
then he died
but he has forgotten me and my promise i must keep
but now she and sigurd loved each other and promised to be true to each other and he gave her a ring and it was the last ring taken from the dwarf andvari
and one day otter had been fishing there and had killed a salmon and eaten it and was sleeping like an otter on a stone
a rich house where the maids wore gold said the king truly you are no maid but a kings daughter
then sigurd remembered how the story went that somewhere far away there was a beautiful lady enchanted
my father gave me a gold ring said she and always ere the dawning it grows cold on my finger
the third bird said
he had a tutor to be with him and once the tutor bade him go to the king and ask for a horse
but he was brave and he spoke not a word of it to the others to make them unhappy
first fafnir the dragon killed his own father and then he went and wallowed on the gold and would let his brother have none and no man dared go near it
that they may keep it is necessary not to be sparing of sugar
it is considered to be sufficiently boiled when some taken up in a spoon pours out like oil
the use of the spaddle is to stir up and remove from the sides of the freezing pot the cream which in the shaking may have washed against it and by stirring it in with the rest to prevent waste of it occurring
boil the solution again throw in a little more cold water remove the scum and so on for three or four times successively then strain it
ices are composed it is scarcely necessary to say of congealed cream or water combined sometimes with liqueurs or other flavouring ingredients or more generally with the juices of fruits

the expense of preserving them with sugar is a serious objection for except the sugar is used in considerable quantities the success is very uncertain sugar also overpowers and destroys the sub acid taste so desirable in many fruits these which are preserved in this manner are chiefly intended for the dessert
in this way it is also that orange and lemon chips are preserved
put more sugar on this and then another layer of the slices and so on till the jar is full

the principal thing to be acquainted with is the fact that in proportion as the syrup is longer boiled its water will become evaporated and its consistency will be thicker
a dessert would not now be considered complete without candied and preserved fruits and confections
the principal utensils required for making ice creams are ice tubs freezing pots spaddles and a cellaret
before sugar was in use honey was employed to preserve many vegetable productions though this substance has now given way to the juice of the sugar cane
when the ice tub is prepared with fresh pounded ice and salt the freezing pot is put into it up to its cover
the thousand and one ornamental dishes that adorn the tables of the wealthy should be purchased from the confectioner they cannot profitably be made at home
the reason why the fruit is emptied out of the preserving pan into an earthen pan is that the acid of the fruit acts upon the copper of which the preserving pans are usually made
the garnishing needs especial attention as the contrast of the brilliant coloured fruits with nicely arranged foliage is very charming
let it boil up again then take it off and remove carefully the scum that has risen

the patterns and colours are also subject to changes of fashion some persons selecting china chaste in pattern and colour others elegantly shaped glass dishes on stems with gilt edges

dessert dishes
it has long been a desideratum to preserve fruits by some cheap method yet by such as would keep them fit for the various culinary purposes as making tarts and other similar dishes
however as late as the reigns of our two last georges fabulous sums were often expended upon fanciful desserts
the syrup employed should sometimes be clarified which is done in the following mannerdissolve two pounds of loaf sugar in a pint of water add to this solution the white of an egg and beat it well
lastly tie a wet bladder over the mouth of the jar or cork and wax it
boil them up three days successively skimming each time and they will then be finished and in a state fit to be put into pots for use
confectionary
until fruit can be used it should be placed in the dairy an ice house or a refrigerator
but to distinguish these properly requires very great attention and considerable experience
the spaddle is generally made of copper kept bright and clean
it is necessary then that this function should have scarcely commenced or that it should be completely finished before partaking of ices
they are preserved abroad in most ornamental and elegant forms
great care must be taken in the management of the fire that the syrup does not boil over and that the boiling is not carried to such an extent as to burn the sugar

after each bailing it is proper to examine into the state of the syrup when cold if too thin it will bear additional boiling if too thick it may be lowered with more syrup of the usual standard

any of the fruits that have been preserved in syrup may be converted into dry preserves by first draining them from the syrup and then drying them in a stove or very moderate oven adding to them a quantity of powdered loaf sugar which will gradually penetrate the fruit while the fluid parts of the syrup gently evaporate
if the pan is placed close on to the fire the preserve is very liable to burn and the colour and flavour be consequently spoiled
fruit pastes are a kind of marmalades consisting of the pulp of fruits first evaporated to a proper consistency and afterwards boiled with sugar

general observations on preserves confectionary ices and dessert dishes
they should be dried in the stove or oven on a sieve and turned every six or eight hours fresh powdered sugar being sifted over them every time they are turned
at desserts or at some evening parties ices are scarcely to be dispensed with
the aged the delicate and children should abstain from ices or iced beverages even the strong and healthy should partake of them in moderation
when they have cooled take them out and drain them
the method to be pursued in the freezing process must be attended to

but he was very wroth and none can blame him for that so he caused the brother to be thrown into a pit full of snakes
when the king entered and saw it he stood still as if he were in fetters and could not stir from the spot for the picture seemed to him so beautiful
kiss me girl said the head
what is my brother saying asked his sister again
she shall be the prettiest girl that ever was and fair and bright as the day said the first head
on the first thursday night after this a beautiful maiden came into the kitchen of the palace and begged the kitchen maid who slept there to lend her a brush
they were both good children and loved each other with all their hearts
she wept and she wailed but as her brother had said that she thought she must do it so she leaped into the sea
what is my brother saying asked the mans daughter
one day they sent her to the brook to fetch some water home and an ugly and horrible head rose up out of the water and said wash me girl
they made her do all the hard work and hard words fell to her lot early and late but little enough food accompanied them
the mans daughter wept and was sorely troubled for little snow was the dearest thing she had on earth but at last she threw him overboard
then she was forced to depart but as she went she said
he says that you are to throw your casket out into the sea answered the step mother
open the door cried the king but the youth did not hear
the step mother fell into such a towering passion that she drove the mans daughter into the pig styeshe might stay there with her fine show of gold the step mother said but she should not be permitted to set foot in the house
at last they came in sight of land
brush me girl said the head
as if i would kiss your ugly mouth said the girl
well if my brother says so i must do it said the mans daughter and she flung her casket into the sea
both her step mother and her step sister were always finding fault with her whatsoever she did and whithersoever she went and they scolded her and abused her so that she never had an hours peace
i shall come twice more and then never again said she
this time also as before she borrowed a brush and brushed her hair with it and the gold dropped down as she did it and again she sent the dog out three times and when day dawned she departed but as she was going she said as she had said before i shall come once more and then never again
there is nowhere on earth so beautiful a woman as this said the king
but though he rubbed his eyes and did everything he could to keep himself awake it was all in vain for the bushy bride crooned and sang till his eyes were fast closed and when the beautiful young maiden came he was sound asleep and snoring
yes i will kiss you said the mans daughter and she did it but she thought it was the worst bit of work that she had ever had to do in her life
the third time it was just beginning to grow light and then she said
kiss me girl said the head
so they sailed onwards a long way farther
i cant get near because of my nose said the daughter
but his sister who was still at home fared worse and worse
so the heads all began to talk to each other and to ask what they should do for this girl who was so full of kindliness
now he says that you are to make haste and throw yourself overboard answered the step mother
after some time had gone by the man married again and he chose a widow with one daughter who was ugly and wicked and her mother was ugly and wicked too
when the brother arrived at home to fetch his sister her stepmother and step sister would go too
it is i i want to come in
wash me girl it said
when she got there with her pails the first head rose up out of the water close to the bank
bushy bride
wash yourself answered the womans daughter
then the second head appeared
these two things were all that she had inherited from her mother
now i shall never come again she said and then she turned to go
at first the king would not believe this but after a long long time they prevailed with him and he crept on tip toe to the door peeped through and saw the youth on his knees with his hands clasped together before a picture which was hanging on the wall
chris turned his back on mike and started down the hill
gee
yes said chris suddenly im coming
are you coming mike challenged with a hint of derision
well he admitted i did
o k he said
im going now
everybody knows whats outside his window he burst out
wickers such a queer old guy
but a chore was a chore and was never worth discussion
you said you were coming with me
he spoke cheerfully
whaddaya suppose
at the foot of the hill he reached the house
chris started off once more passing the bleak little victorian church perched on the hill above mr wickers house
there were three things that always caught his eye amid the litter of dusty pieces
his gaze moved back to the house itself
my mother told me to bring her some stuff from the safeway
you bet he does
his mothers sick he repeated an jakey don look so good himself
after a step or two not finding his friend beside him he turned
mike stopped and looked at chris with a comical expression
chris paused to look below him
even from where he stood fifty feet above the house the slope of the hill was sharp and the plan of the house below him could be plainly seen
think he really needs it he pursued
well i was mike howled back but i just remembered
all at once he wondered how his mother was and everything in him pinched and tightened itself
houses and shops thinned suddenly on both sides of the street
so mike swallowed
only why didnt you ask him yourself
mike was standing on the corner
o k
lets see you
ill go with ya mike announced as if that finished the argument which as a matter of fact it did
it was getting dark
certainly my boy boomed out the captain his blue eyes abruptly keen and penetrating
maybe whoever it was will give himself away somehow and give me a clue
no doubt
next ned cilley was relieved at the helm by elbert jones who took over
ned went on down
mr finney will be some time on deck
chris lost no time as soon as he could do it without being noticed in hurrying down to his cabin
racing to his cabin and back even in those few seconds chris could see a change in the sky
oh sir he cried mr
i think i can do it safely or i should not try sir
he then went on to describe what else was to followthe covering of the ship with leaves to make it blend with its surroundings camouflage was not a word the captain or anyone else of his time yet understood
yes sir
it looks to me as if it could have been one of several people and ill be switched if i know who
we shall say no more but i trust you understand the responsibility you have
he joked with the cook at the galley door and probably went on for i didnt see him come by again
what can be said during that time sir chris thought to ask
they went down to their quarters first they were really closest to the hatch
or did he
i shall say that you are in my own cabin so that i can care for you
he knew now that his absence for as long as he had to be away would be covered up and satisfactorily accounted for
guess mr finney went to his quartersi dont remember seeing him cross the deck or come over that way at all
chris wrinkled his brow with concentration
they had the vigor of a man in the prime of life and their presence in that puckered face of age which confronted chris was horribly disconcerting
the sharp black outline of mr wicker impressed itself on his eyeballs and in the room now totally dark except for the light that streamed from the faraway open door mr wickers body seemed to radiate a bright edge like a carbon paper held up to the sun
hes a schoolmate of mine
yes sir he said
mr wickers eyes were not those of an old man at all
the room seemed overly still
yes they were still there
he guessed there must be a lively fire in that room beyond
the double fans of minute wrinkles breaking from eye corner to temple and joining with those over the cheekbones were drawn into the horizontal lines across the domed forehead
the thin lips crackled the withered and multi wrinkled cheeks in the ghost of what had once been a smile
chris could catch the shine as lantern glow touched the silver buckles on their shoes
what he saw was a fresh cheeked lad tall for thirteen sturdy with sincerity and good humor in his face and something sensitive and appealing about his eyes
going as far as the wall to his left and leaning forward chris looked up toward m street
would that interfere with jakeys getting the job sir chris enquired
the wide bow window was there before him the three objects he liked best showing frosty in the moonlight that poured in from across the water
ii just wondered if the place was still open
then in that second he turned and faced about
he thought he detected a pleasant smell of herbs like the potpourri his mother had in bowls in their house
it wouldnt be fair for me to take it if jakey has a chance
you wanted something
william wickers face in itself was not forbidding
flabbergasted and breathless chris was unaware that he had moved closer to peer out the window in every direction
and why had the sound of wheels of gears and of horns been so completely muffled out
they moved into the inn the coach rattled off to the stable
you see i dont really need it and jakey does
jakey will be cared for never fear
it was no longer there nor were the high walls and smokestacks of factories to be seen
chris blinked and looked again
no electric signs no lamplit streets
you dont say on the sign and jakey isnt awfully well
where was the freeway
mr wicker was busy and becky boozer had gone off to market accompanied by ned cilley
mr wicker waited patiently beside him for a few moments for chris to get up his courage
the more he thought of it the more chris knew it had to be attempted
he squatted on his haunches examining the carved wooden figure attentively and felt convinced that once alive the boy would be an ideal and happy companion
if you get stuck i can help you
if he was to be a magician could he make this boy come to life
grown people however gay and kind were never quite the same
there were the words and there the charm certain elements were to be mixed and poured at the proper time
dusk came two hours before its time thunder snarled in the sky
remember incantation seventy three book one
he hurried memorizing as he closed the book and hoisted it once more to its high shelf
well what do you know
from that time chris became increasingly proficient and as his ability grew he began to find magic a wonderful game which he and mr wicker played together
seventy four book one the return
his head swam and he felt faint and a little sick but he persisted through the final words
the afternoon rainy before increased in storm
mr wicker began moving about upstairs the floorboards creaked and still chris could not leave until the potion fumed and glowed
with difficulty standing on tiptoe chris lifted it down and placing it on the floor turned over page after page
better come back now
what shall i do first
one day chris wandered alone into the dusty shop
you will do famously my boy
suppose i change and cant change back
chris got up and stole back to mr wickers door
never fear christopher
how you have improved my boy he exclaimed
this union will fill with happiness the hearts of all toilers
at this moment we are not only trying to solve the land question but the question of social revolutionnot only here in russia but all over the world
are you going to allow the ranks of the proletariat to be divided
yes they cried wait until the peasants speak
that is what is happening at this moment yesterday kerensky to day lenin and trotzky another to morrow
long live the united democracy the peasants poured out of the building
he knew that an agreement with the bolsheviki was being discussed but he did not know that it had been concluded
you call yourselves the people of russia
who are you
the old executive committee had withdrawn and was holding a rump convention of its own in another room of the same building made up of bolting delegates and representatives of the army committees
from now on in the russian republic all the organisation and administration of the state from top to bottom must rest on that union
long live the peasants
lenin and trotzky remained in the government and the military revolutionary committee continued to function
who administers the confiscated landthe former proprietor or the land committees
what has been done with the agricultural machinery and with the farm animals
then boris reinstein delegate of the american socialist labor party the day of the union of the congress of peasants and the soviets of workers and soldiers deputies is one of the great days of the revolution
how much and in what respect does the amount of land now under cultivation differ from the amount fixed by the government as an average minimum
i say count on that revolutionary determination but dont forget your gun
his first act was to bitterly rebuke the executive committee for leaving the congress
but will the constituent assembly desire to do the will of the russian peasants
by declaring the assembly extraordinary conference it had been planned to block the reelection of the executive committee
the great hall was jammed with people and shaken with continual clamour deep stubborn bitterness divided the delegates into angry groups
even the sun came out pale and watery at noon
the dumas and zemstvos were dropped
only two months before considered an extreme revolutionist and very popular with the peasants he was now called to check the dangerous drift of the congress toward the left
the life of the city grew gay and the very revolution ran swifter
wait until the peasants
he spoke to the rump convention
the peasants understood the exact meaning of the revolutionthey tried to turn words into action
it is desirable that agricultural properties well appointed and well organised should be administered by soviets composed of the regular employees of those properties under the direction of competent agricultural scientists
after a brief conversation i leftand thats all let any one present make such an accusation
now people accuse kerensky they forget that he was raised to power not only by the soviets but also by the popular masses
he was interrupted by a great burst of laughter and realising the situation he left the platform and the room taking his popularity with him
if compromise continues the revolution disappears
has the ground cultivated by the peasants been augmented
shooting down your russian brothers on the streets
while the peasants had been politically backward still they had their own peculiar ideas and they constituted more than eighty per cent of the people of russia
however no harm has been done by that for the land committees are paying no attention to the soviet decrees but are putting into operation their own practical decisionsdecisions based on the will of the vast majority of the peasants
the savages set up gods to which they pray and which they punish if one of their prayers is not answered
if we are broken then it will be in defending our flag
lenins argument was simple
the other old peasant spoke to his comrade i am not tired he said
arent they workingmen like ourselves
we have proposed to both kerensky and the bolsheviki to retire from the power
a german
the galleries were thronged with workerswho in russia still remember their peasant origin
followed him lenin listened to now with absorbing intensity
but this worked both ways the left socialist revolutionists decided that if the congress had no power over the executive committee then the executive committee had no power over the congress
you should remain neutral
meanwhile the question of the status of the executive committee was agitating all minds
there is no force in the world which can put out the fire of the revolution
the recent events said the orator do not indicate a simple riot or a bolshevik adventure but on the contrary a real popular rising which has been greeted with sympathy by the whole country
all right said he
he must study the aspects of the agrarian problem in the province
finally except for the right side of the hall the demonstration wore itself out somewhat
if the bolsheviki succeed or if they fail the fate of russia will not be changed
of that we cannot be sure
it seemed to me as if the congress were hopelessly deadlocked
and with the shout long live the end of civil war
as far as the constituent assembly is concerned it is true as the preceding speaker has said that the work of the constituent will depend on the revolutionary determination of the masses
cries down with the bolsheviki
on the twenty seventh occurred the debate on the land question which revealed the differences between the agrarian programme of the bolsheviki and the left socialist revolutionaries
in spite of revolution all russia plunging dizzily into the unknown and terrible future joy swept the city with the coming of the snow
from the first days the bolsheviki declared that the peasants should take over the land by revolutionary mass action this is nothing but anarchy the land can be taken over in an organised manner
comrades
right away
the socialist political partythis is the vanguard of the working class it must not allow itself to be halted by the lack of education of the mass average but it must lead the masses using the soviets as organs of revolutionary initiative
we bolsheviki have not changed our land programme we have not given up the abolition of private property in the land and we do not intend to do so
the land decree of the congress of soviets is identical in its fundamentals with the decisions of the first peasants congress
where does such an accusation come from
who are you to destroy the legal government
with biting sarcasm he went on to speak of the allied diplomats till then contemptuous of russias invitation to an armistice which had been accepted by the central powers
in the morning we woke to window ledges heaped white and snowflakes falling so whirling thick that it was impossible to see ten feet ahead
for these reasons the peasants congress sustains entirely the revolution of november seventh as a social revolution and expresses its unalterable will to put into operation with whatever modifications are necessary but without any hesitation the social transformation of the russian republic
he was invited to sit on the platform
you are no better than murderers he cried
we dont recognise your government
the russian villages understand perfectly what they want and they are now carrying out their own measures
long live the revolutionary army
the constituent assembly will not dare to break with the will of the people
the reactionaries of the executive committee no longer dared openly to appear
show me the source
we invite the left socialist revolutionaries to enter that coalition insisting however that they cease looking backward and that they break with the conciliators of their party
however he went on in an unmoved voice nobody will deny that the present government of russia has been formed by the bolshevik party he had to wait a moment so that for all purposes it is the same thing here the right benches broke into deafening clamour but the centre and left were curious and compelled silence
whereupon the old executive committee left the hall
the sound of it will ring with resounding echoes throughout the whole worldin paris in london and across the oceanin new york
anybody who attempts to destroy the soviets is guilty of an anti democratic and counter revolutionary act
the captain shouted at the top of his voice
i greet you with the christening of a new russian life and freedom
moreover i want to warn you now that the bolsheviki will never accept your demands
at every mention of the word union there was ecstatic applause
singa phut was the panting answer
you cant take it away said donovan
in fact i have a feeling that ill land my fish
for they recognized that the colonel would be against them and the prosecutors detectives when it came to the trial of james darcy
get ready shag
and can it be done
ha laughed donovan shortly
now i know
glad to know you colonel ashley said donovan
see you later and making sure that his blackjack and revolver were in his pockets donovan hurried out followed by the colonel whose hand had loosely closed over the ticking watch which unseen went out with him
its just one of them coincidences like
look here colonel do you know anything about this and the detectives professional instincts got the upper hand of his friendliness
held so tight we could hardly get it out
just that
this is an old timer
as you may have guessed its a divorce case i have just finished and so quietly that it hasnt become public property yet
and donovan take a friends advice and dont be too free with that watch
hello answered the sleuth
ever take it up and as the colonel questioned he was looking at the indian timepiece under a magnifying glass he took from his pocket
now im afraid i wont
neighbors often heard em scrappin a lot and this afternoon they went at it again hot and heavy
and the watch
and theres no reason you shouldnt know
are you going to work on that case colonel
it isnt our case so we dont know much about it
who has it
you do as i tell you
if youll excuse me ill pretend im fishing and i may catch something
all we want to dopinkus and meis to lay our hands on the dago that done it and got away
yes that parts true enough but thats all there is to it
but how did it happen
of courseas is usual in a divorce case
then you think he did it
not the least in the worldnot as much as you do was the cool answer
i shouldnt be surprised but what it dated back to the time of queen elizabeth though it has been repaired and remodeled since then to make it more up to date
yes went on the colonel musingly
i may need it as evidence when we get mr phut or whatever the dagos name is
pinkus and donovan havent they carroll
the old adage of two heads you know
yes
but all joking aside this is quite a wonderful piece of work
oh no i wouldnt think of taking it away
gad exclaimed the colonel
singa phut got back his watch after the prosecutor decided he didnt need it for evidence
the two men had seen each other before but had not spoken
busted his head in with a heavy candlestickone of a pair
i suppose the ladythere is a lady in it of course questioned the colonel
yes
too free with it asked the surprised detective
go as far as you like colonel returned thong needlessly generous weve got our man and thats all we want
then things quieted down and nobody heard anything more
thats right agreed the colonel as he continued to move his magnifying glass over the surface of the still ticking watch
in fact it was so tight that hes cut his palm grabbin hold of it
yes its here
maybe the fight was about who owned the watch for the dagos talked in their foreign lingo and none of the neighbors could tell what they were sayin
but well get him
how did it happen
yes but its so plain theres no interest in it for you
rather a hypothetical question colonel but i should say it might be a fifty fifty proposition
that was away back in the fifteenth century
exactly
if theyre here yes
i see
and ive read enough about germs to know the danger
and the watch was in alis hand
simply because this watch
i should worry about that
dont scratch yourself on it whatever you do
in a way yes
surest thing you know
whats up asked carroll
he raised the howl right off and pinkus and i got there as soon as we could
perhaps not admitted colonel ashley
its mrs larch wife of langford larch the wealthy hotel owner
sure he did
id advise you to be careful
and a close observer might have observed that he did not touch his bare fingers to the timepiece but poked it about and touched it here and there with the end of a leadpencil
me study watches
oh no i was just interested as singa phut was one concerned in mrs darcys murder
and you are right
no one knows much about ali for he came here just recently
thanks laughed kenneth
thats all right shag
be back in a minute
there wasnt nothing that singa had to do with the darcy case anyhow and he seemed awful anxious to get back that watch
why not
im working in the interests of the young man
but did he really kill his partner
and is there any truth in the newspaper story about the same watch that was found in mrs darcys hand being found in the hand of the dead man
very interesting
quite an interesting studywatchesdonovan
but for a quiet place to think give me a fishing excursion every time
no alimony repeated the colonel puzzled
all rightbe there in a second
perhaps i can help you
who
donovan
well get him too before many days
youre on the darcy case they tell me
but i need to do a little more smoking out first
some one out here to see you
sure
i want to talk over darcys case with you the colonel had said
have you it
but as a matter of fact these east indians are often carriers of bubonic plague you know and its very contagious
ive read a lot about you
i dont want it either
probably new works put in
very interesting observed the colonel as he passed the watch back to donovan still using only the flat open palm of his hand on which to rest it
carroll and thong were there and if they did not exactly welcome the colonel as a kindred spirit they at least accorded him the respect due a fellow craftsman in the peculiar line where talent may be found most unexpectedly
now i want to think
yep carroll was too much engaged in watching the blue smoke curl lazily upward from his cigar just then to say more
he found the place without a light in it stumbled over something on the floor and there was alis body with the head busted in and this heavy candlestick near it
yes
id recommend him to you instead of blackstone
well the question i am trying to solve is why did she say no alimony
and ive got to do some tall thinking now
some dago had his head busted in remarked thong
youre not as squeamish as all that are you
what
but i want to know just where we stand
you buy cried donovan
hear it tick and donovan held open the door of his closet
queen elizabeth was very fond of watches and clocks and her friends knowing that used to present her with beautiful specimens some of the watches of her day were made in the form of crosses purses little books and even skulls
ah theres nothing like the philosophy of my friend izaak walton
and the two had talked had thought had talked again and now were silent for a time
i should say not
weve got to prove james darcy innocent by establishing the fact that some one else killed his cousin
somewhat to the surprise of donovan the military detective accepted the timepiece on his open palm and so gingerly that it caused donovan to remark
but i hear you have another murder
it still holds good
thats the watch announced the headquarters detective reaching in for it
oh well there isnt much of a story to it and donovans voice showed his disappointment
who else
but there are some peculiar coincidences and if you dont mind id like to see what i can find out about them
i have a little problem on my hands
when it does it will create a sensation
if you dont mind i should like to examine this a bit
yes
what is it
the very pair i was going to buy
she has just been granted on my application before the vice chancellor a separation from her husband but she refused to accept alimony and for the life of me with all larchs wealth i cant see why
friend of mine just tipped me off where i can get him
quite a curiosity said the colonel at length
colonel ashley said nothing
it can and im going to do it
oh not at all was the quick answer
what are the chances of getting him off legally if we go at it from a negative standpoint asked the colonel
heres some one to see you and the presentation was quickly and informally made
king regarded his questioner gravely as though deeply pondering over the matter
but it will take time
a number of men about town as they liked to be called were in and colonel ashley was sipping his julep when there entered mr kettridge the relative of mrs darcy whose jewelry shop he was managing pending a settlement of her estate
then for the love of
what called kenneth
and that behind the laughter in her eyes was the shadow of a skeleton at the feast
but amyand the disgrace
i have been spending a week end in the country king remarked with biting sarcasm
but i dont suppose more than two or three know that
and it takes all sorts of persons to make it up
he saw darcy frequently at the jail and to that young mans pleadings that something be done always returned the answer
hello harry
go on
so i understand
you arent the only suspect though
why not
there was a laugh at this for scarcely one in the gilded grill but knew where king had been and whither he was going
they took harry away a while ago
langford larch could not himself be called a drinking man occasionally as almost perforce he had to he drank a little wine but he was never noticeably drunk
to this was the answerwhispered
my idea exactly returned the colonel
quite a racing man he is a gentleman and a fine judge not only of whisky which is good in its place but of horses and men too
he seems to have been decent for a while after their marriagewhich marriage was a mistake from the firsti can see that now
why polonius some one asked
dont worry
isnt it agreed the colonel
only that i darcy hesitated and grew red
larch
i wasnt thinking of that
now cheer up
she doesnt consider herself disgraced and you shouldnt
besides anything i could say now wouldnt set you free
the rumors floated about a bit seemed to sink and then started off at full steam just before the news of the separation became public
going a little higher up the scale in population he might have been designated as a hotel proprietor
well when cynthia came to me in my capacity as lawyer as well as old friend i could hardly believe what she told me about her husband went on kenneth
i didnt
she was really forced into this marriage which to say the least must have been distasteful to her
have you any theory
the odd coin
will you join me in a welsh rabbit
larch is lushing
for i really think he loved cynthia once
they talked of much including the murder and the colonel was more than pleased to find that the jeweler had no very strong suspicion against young darcy
why did she take him
larch himself was a peculiar character
and her father toohes with you from the drop of the flag he told me
no
the evening passed pleasantly for them
colonel ashley fished for a time in silence broken only by the gentle snores of shag farther back in the field and by the murmur of the water
he remembered that cynthia and grafton had once been in love with each other
i think i see it now
well i dont know that you can
nor was that side of his business ever accentuated
because larch made no defense
it was often characteristic of him that though he became very much intoxicated yet at times under such conditions harry kings language approached the cultured rather than degenerated into the common talk of the ordinary drunk
the stopped clocks for instance
i dont imagine for a moment that fool king had a hand in this affair
but i have been gathering up some loose ends and i think i know where to tie them together
grave and even reverend conventions assembled in its ballroom and politicians of the upper if not better class were frequently seen in its dining room or cafe
i said where have you been remarked the other
it was all due to a misunderstanding he said
it happened to be so now
youve got a friend in her of whom you may be proud
it isnt generally known went on the lawyer that the hotel keepers wife has left him
not a great deal
no
it had a double reputation so to speak
larch by refusing to appear practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation
thanks
so king got bail
you cant get out before a trial or before i can produce some one on whom i can actually fasten the murder
the colonel did not disclose the fact that it was no news to him aaron graftons statement was being unexpectedly confirmed
i think i do
incidentally the vice chancelor was furious when it became known that the documents had been inspected by a reporter but then it was too late
she also saw an opportunity of paying old debts and reaping some revenges
he was bailed out to day
on those grounds i went before the vice chancellor prepared to prove my case by competent witnesses
good evening colonel he called genially
well its a queer world anyhow
because dear friend replied king softly he somewhat resembles a certain person here who talks too much but who is not so wise as he thinks
theres harry king still locked up
but for a time the entertainments were kept up and cynthia lovelier than ever presided at her husbands table graced it with her presence and laughed and smiled at the men and women who came to partake of their lavish hospitality
now as to certain matters in the store on the morning of the murder
who put it up
the hotel keeper
i used to know cynthia when she was a girlshe was the daughter of lodan ratchford and her mother had peculiar and to my mind wrong ideas of social position and money
but in colchester which was rather unique among cities he was looked up to as one of the substantial citizens of the place for he owned the homestead where washington when it was a wayside inn had stopped one nightat least such was the rumorand families socially prominent some of whose members had very strong views on prohibition did not hesitate to attend balls given at the hotel
so cheer up and ill do the best i can for you
and when the fish was landed panting on the grass and shag had been roused from his slumber to slip the now limp fish into the creel colonel ashley gave a sigh of relief and remarked
however dont think im not interested in your case
she had some means of her own she declared and would work rather than accept a cent from him
money
he let the case go by default for which i was glad as it saved cynthia from telling her story in open court
im going to rectify them
in a smaller place he would have been called a saloon keeper
the reason she asked no alimony inquired kenneth
my fish chuckled the colonel as he skilfully played the luckless trout now struggling to get loose from the hook
i cant tell you yet darcy
i wish i had been in his shoes
thats what he did
and it was whispered about
there was little that was tangiblemere gossipa hint that she would have been happier with some one else though he had not so much money as had larch
the solution to my problem
no
im glad youre not
no but he will or ill sue him and get judgment
ive fished enough for to day
the finely appointed hotel kept by larch called the homestead from the name of an old inn of colonial days which it replaced was known for miles around
gradually there had come about little whispers that cynthia larch had made a mistake in her marriage
they had become friends since the colonels first visit to the store and the friendship had grown as they found they had congenial tastes
but his are pretty uncertain shoes to be in just the same
came at that instant fairly bursting into the quiet grill room some jolly good fellows to take them at their own valuation
im working several ends and they all must be fitted together like the old jigsaw puzzle before i can act
he isnt cried the old detective and there was surprise in his voice
but the separation of mr and mrs larch was different
there were three of them the center figure being that of harry king and he was very much intoxicated
mrs larch resuming her maiden name it was announced had gone to a quiet place to rest
i am as shag calls it detectin and i just came out here to clarify my thoughts
its a plain and sordid story enough with the exception of her refusal of alimony and that i cant understand
well poor cynthia is paying the penalty now
she said he had struck her more than once and she could stand it no longer
oh hell pay all right
still i would like to know
after the marriage which was a brilliant and gay one if not happy the larch hotelit could hardly be called a homebecame the scene of many festive occasions
all in good time
ill tell her
do you know who killed my cousin
it will come out all right
it has no connection with the darcy murder and so i didnt mention it to you before
meanwhile colonel ashley was a very busy man and to no one did he tell very much about his activities
but they were not needed
hell be so tickled to get out of paying his wife a monthly sum that hell settle with me
ive known him from a boy said mr kettridge and though he has his faults a crime such as this would be almost impossible to him no matter what motive such as the dispute over money or his sweetheart he may be guilty but i doubt it
and in a way it was true
all in good time
did he pay it
im glad you told me though
there will be a sensation when this comes out
the best of police headquarters or prosecutors detectives make mistakes
not that ordinarily im satisfied with one but im not working the rod now
and i cant do that yet
i guess i understand said the colonel with a laugh
the old colored man wrapped in a warm coat for it was not summer yet seemed to be enjoying his siesta when with a suddenness that was startling in that solitude the military detective uttered a cry of
the murder of mrs darcy had some time ago been shifted off the front page though it would get back there when the young jeweler was tried as for the killing of shere ali that occasioned only passing interest the murdered man not being well known
i beg your pardon he said in the cultured tones he knew so well how to use yet of which he made so little use of late
i thought you knew it
for the papers of her testimony had been sealed and it was only by a sharp trick on the part of daley that he got access to them
certainly my dear kenneth
darcy youve got good friends
having done that im at your service if i can help
ive got it
weve missed you
thank you no im afraid my digestion isnt quite up to that as ive had to cut out my fishing of late
being convenient to the courthouse nearly all the judges and lawyers took lunch there
as i said the facts of the separation of the larchs will soon be heralded all over the city for the final papers were filed to day and the reporters will be sure to see them
that is not always but sometimes
but thats not the point votes please
that is a matter for each mans own decision he said severely
levin went nearer
and the marshal disappeared through a side door
no checking the accounts of the marshal hes not a cashier
they expressed the most implacable hatred
im worn out im old
in the doorway the marshal of the province jostled against levin
several times he repeated the words i have served to the best of my powers with truth and good faith i value your goodness and thank you and suddenly he stopped short from the tears that choked him and went out of the room
put it to the vote
two noble gentlemen who had a weakness for strong drink had been made drunk by the partisans of snetkov and a third had been robbed of his uniform
then several voices began to talk all at once and the tall nobleman with the ring getting more and more exasperated shouted more and more loudly
beg pardon excuse me please he said as to a stranger but recognizing levin he smiled timidly
the confidence of the monarch
the leaders of both parties were reckoning white and black on their fingers
his face and his whole figure in his uniform with the crosses and white trousers striped with braid as he moved hurriedly along reminded levin of some hunted beast who sees that he is in evil case
in reply snetkov spoke of the trust the noblemen of the province had placed in him the affection they had shown him which he did not deserve as his only merit had been his attachment to the nobility to whom he had devoted twelve years of service
they are voting on the legal point
and one vote may decide the whole question and one must be serious and consecutive if one wants to be of use in public life concluded sergey ivanovitch
it seemed to levin that he would have liked to say something but could not speak for emotion
but the old party did not consider themselves conquered
sergey ivanovitch put his hand into the box put the ball somewhere and making room for levin stopped
levin was standing rather far off
the discussion upon flerov had given the new party not only flerovs vote but had also gained time for them so that they could send to fetch three noblemen who had been rendered unable to take part in the elections by the wiles of the other party
the crowd parted to make way for sergey ivanovitch approaching the table
sergey ivanovitch read the act and began to explain its meaning but at that point a tall stout round shouldered landowner with dyed whiskers in a tight uniform that cut the back of his neck interrupted him
no need for more talking
a hundred and twenty six for admission
please come konstantin d mitrievitch he said your brothers looking for you
sergey ivanovitch frowned
its not likely said the marshal looking round with a scared expression
but levin forgot all that and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons for whom he had a respect in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement
they were disputing as far as he could make out as to the interpretation to be put on the act and the exact meaning of the words liable to be called up for trial
to escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the refreshment bar
this old man was a touching and pathetic figure to levin now and he longed to say something pleasant to him
sergey ivanovitch waiting till the malignant gentleman had finished speaking said that he thought the best solution would be to refer to the act itself and asked the secretary to find the act
so youre sure to be our marshal again he said
but the persons speaking paused and his improper question was overheard
looks and faces were even more violent and furious than their words
a ballot
they were to proceed immediately to the election
every nobleman sees it
a ballot
the most solemn moment was at hand
we shed our blood for our country
on learning this the new party had made haste during the dispute about flerov to send some of their men in a sledge to clothe the stripped gentleman and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting
hes all right
beastly shouted furious and violent voices on all sides
there are some among us too like our friend nikolay ivanovitch or count vronsky thats settled here lately who try to carry on their husbandry as though it were a factory but so far it leads to nothing but making away with capital on it
i have told him so but it makes no difference only think of it
last year at our district marshal nikolay ivanovitchs
theyre proprietors of a sort but were the landowners
but ones work is thrown in for nothing
above suspicion
yes levin answered with proud satisfaction
without a return too
yes yes said levin thats perfectly true
why as you said to keep the fire in
i speak from my heart
the excitement grew more intense and every face betrayed some uneasiness
well and how is your land doing
but i tell you what the landowner pursued a neighbor of mine a merchant was at my place
the landowner chuckled under his white mustaches
next a whole crowd of country gentlemen surrounding a stout general hurriedly came near levin
were all gentlemen arent we
yes its rather strange he went on
well and how is your land doing asked levin
then why do you come asked levin
so therell be no one to keep it up
he knew him at once
its a decaying institution that goes on running only by the force of inertia
and nowadays that barks worth something
these gentlemen now what do they come for he said pointing to the malignant gentleman who was talking at the high table
as noblemen theyre cutting their own throats
very very glad to have met you he added seeing sviazhsky approaching him
what would you have
hes such a blackguard
oh well one does it
theres no meaning in it at all
and with what he made hed increase his stock or buy some land for a trifle and let it out in lots to the peasants levin added smiling he had evidently more than once come across those commercial calculations
and hed make his fortune
he went to the window and sat down scanning the groups and listening to what was being said around him
why what is there to understand
from habit nothing else
and yet one does it
at a simple loss
he couldnt collect it in three years he heard vigorously uttered by a round shouldered short country gentleman who had pomaded hair hanging on his embroidered collar and new boots obviously put on for the occasion with heels that tapped energetically as he spoke
oh damn your acts
that it may be but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully
yes but you dont reckon your own work
oh not very well
my son in law wants to stand as a permanent member theyre not rich people and he must be brought forward
its a moral obligation of a sort
they were the generals organizing the approaching battle
snetkov now
then why do you do it if its a clear loss
ill tell you my own case
we may be of use or we may not but were the growth of a thousand years
the rest like the rank and file before an engagement though they were getting ready for the fight sought for other distractions in the interval
i make five per cent
very glad to see you
i ought to own that i dont very well understand the drift of the provincial elections said levin
thats the new generation of nobility
you wont grow him again in a year he said cautiously and he immediately changed the conversation
theres no doubt hell be a scientific man
and then to tell the truth theres ones own interests
i remember you very well
these persons were unmistakably seeking a place where they could talk without being overheard
to be sure
the speaker was a country gentleman with gray whiskers wearing the regimental uniform of an old general staff officer
just as we do said levin
besides thats not work for a nobleman
but you say its an institution thats served its time
levin had seen him already at the meeting on the previous day and he had studiously avoided him not caring to greet him
the landowner looked at him
but nicholas was not at home when they entered
very good
improvident and self indulgent were his words
visiting register offices seeing all manner of unlikely people and very few in the least likely absorbed margarets time and thoughts for several days
its simple and not far to fetch nor hard to work
and i do said her father laughing
but good night child
but though she received caresses and fond words back again in such profusion as would have gladdened her formerly yet she felt that there was a secret withheld from her and she believed it bore serious reference to her mothers health
his father dying in miserable circumstances why it might have been in the workhouse
how would you set about it
at helstone unpunctuality at meal times was a great fault in her mothers eyes but now this as well as many other little irregularities seemed to have lost their power of irritation and margaret almost longed for the old complainings
the mother of whom he spoke to us said margaret
oh papa by that testing everything by the standard of wealth
no one came forwards to help the mother and this boy
i believe what i see and no more
not exactly replied margaret smiling
you have caught her
i am surprised at you margaret said her mother
one afternoon she met bessy higgins in the street and stopped to speak to her
thornton exclaimed mrs hale
she lay awake very long this night planning how to lessen the evil influence of their milton life on her mother
but we must first catch our house mother
now let me try
i may be the cinderella to put on the slipper after all
bessy was silent in her turn for a minute or two
margaret bent over and said bessy dont be impatient with your life whatever it isor may have been
now ill not have my wench preached to
dont think hardly on himhes a good man he is
no mamma that anne buckley would never have done
thats my creed
i dont set him up for a hero or anything of that kind
i really was very much afraid of showing him how much shocked i was at some parts of what he said
but surely said margaret facing round you believe in what i said that god gave her life and ordered what kind of life it was to be
everybody else has had their turn at this great difficulty
how tainted asked her father
i really liked that account of himself better than anything else he said
bell says taking in mr thornton as a kind of partner
i knew it all along from mr bell so i was aware of what was coming but i half expected to see you get up and leave the room
i dont think mr hale you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been
there were several other signs of something wrong about mrs hale
when he spoke of the mechanical powers he evidently looked upon them only as new ways of extending trade and making money
margaret went away very sad and thoughtful
she was late for tea at home
margaret said mr hale as he returned from showing his guest downstairs i could not help watching your face with some anxiety when mr thornton made his confession of having been a shop boy
not vicious he never said that
mr bell said they absolutely lived upon water porridge for yearshow he did not know but long after the creditors had given up hope of any payment of old mr thorntons debts if indeed they ever had hoped at all about it after his suicide this young man returned to milton and went quietly round to each creditor paying him the first instalment of the money owing to him
margaret was collecting her mothers working materials and preparing to go to bed
personally as you call it and all
at last she said in a low voice
have you met with a servant dear
i shall like to see her
there was another child i believe a girl too young to earn money but of course she had to be kept
at least no friend came forwards immediately and mrs thornton is not one i fancy to wait till tardy kindness comes to find her out
his father speculated wildly failed and then killed himself because he could not bear the disgrace
your mother looks sadly tired to night margaret
but what was it
margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to rest upon her bosom
and the poor men around himthey were poor because they were viciousout of the pale of his sympathies because they had not his iron nature and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich
perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us and be glad of our place
margaret did not speak but held the water to her lips
i had forgotten what i said for the time continued margaret quietly i should have thought of it again when i was less busy
she must be an uncommon person her mother added
margaret had noticed her mothers jaded appearance with anxiety for some time past and this remark of her fathers sent her up to bed with a dim fear lying like a weight on her heart
they have said that he is even a little imbecile that he does not remember himself of the most common events of his life
she hurried to him immediately and led him off to look at the picture
i had thought all this philip night after night i had dreamt the same dreamthe bright happy dream in which my father came home to me the fond foolish dream in which i felt his strong arms folded round me and his true heart beating against my own
and laura had her own pet plans
philip jocelyn was examining some pictures on the other side of the room when his wife made this discovery
the artist took out one of his own cards and wrote the required address in pencil
i want to see what he was when he was bright and young before the world had hardened him
he calls himself kerstallfrederick kerstall he is the son of an old monsieur who calls himself also kerstall and who had much of celebrity in england it is many years
what is it you want me to do my darling
well go to mr kerstall immediately if you like
when did i ever say no to anything you asked me laura
but it was not the less the most charming city in the universe and philip jocelyn and his wife were as happy as two children in this paradise of brick and mortar
laura thanked the french artist and then took her husbands arm and walked away with him
laura said all this in a very low voice as she walked with her husband through the garden of the luxembourg
the painter shrugged up his shoulders and pursed up his mouth thoughtfully
sir philip never refused his wife anything so he said yes and laura ran away to her dressing room like a school girl who has been pleading for a holiday and has won her cause
sir philip may have been a little too much devoted to horses and dogs and laura may have been a shade too enthusiastic upon the subject of new bonnets and the jewellery in the rue de la paix
but madame he said this monsieur kerstalls father is very old and he has ceased to paint it is a long time
i remember all the rubenses at the louvre for i saw them three years ago when i was staying in paris with grandpapa
but there are some others who say that his memory has not altogether failed and that he is still enough harshly critical towards the works of others
kerstall exclaimed laura suddenly mr
but before that time i was very unhappy about my father
i wonder who painted that lovely face
i like the modern pictures best philip and i want you to tell me all about the artists and what i ought to admire and all that sort of thing
you will be doing me such a favour philip if youll say yes
i want you to give me a long day in the luxembourg
and his name monsieur
but why are you so anxious to see this old portrait of your father my dear
she returned in a little more than ten minutes in the freshest toilette all pale shimmering blue like the spring sky with pearl grey gloves and boots and parasol and a bonnet that seemed made of azure butterflies
they suited each other so well they were never tired of each others society or at a stand still for want of something to say to each other they were rather frivolous perhaps but a little frivolity may be pardoned in two people who were so very young and so entirely happy
i want to see all the picturesthe modern pictures especially
a discovery at the luxembourg
the frenchman might have run on much longer upon this subject but laura was too impatient to be polite
it was a peasant girls head very exquisitely painted by a modern artist and the baronet approved his wifes taste
ah philip since we have known and loved each other it seems to me as if i had no thought or care for any one in all this wide world except yourself
i should so like one to hang in my morning room at jocelyns rock
how i wish you could get me a copy of that picture philip laura said entreatingly
she turned to the french artist presently and asked him where the elder mr kerstall lived and if there was any possibility of seeing him
one morning laura told her husband with a gay laugh that she was going to victimize him but he was to promise to be patient and bear with her for once in a way
i had expected that he would be so fond of me
i dont think you will have any difficulty in finding the house
because i want to see what he was before he went to india
go leave me fiend replied the wounded norman
and so for some time the fight went on many combatants falling on either side
yet first let me say said de bracy what it imports thee to know
wilfred of ivanhoe exclaimed the black knightprisoner and perish
markest thou the smouldering and suffocating vapour which already eddies in sable folds through the chamber rememberest thou the magazine of fuel that is stored beneath these apartments
and with this epistle the unhappy old man set out to procure his daughters liberation
he denounced rebecca as a witch by whose enchantment bois guilbert had been led to offend against the rules of the holy order and in tones of passion and scorn he refused to listen to isaacs protestations of her innocence
call on them again valiant baron said the hag with a smile of grisly mockery but know mighty chief thou shalt have neither answer nor aid
de bracy said the knight thou art free depart
during the confusion which reigned amongst the followers of front de boeuf when the attack had commenced rebecca had been allowed to take the place of the old crone ulrica who was in close attendance on the wounded man who had been brought into the castle in company with isaac of york and the other captives
before long the towering flames had surmounted every obstruction and rose to the evening skies one huge and burning beacon seen far and wide through the adjacent country tower after tower crashed down with blazing roof and rafter
he had hitherto feared for his daughters honour he was now to tremble for her life
her long dishevelled gray hair flew back from her uncovered head while the delight of gratified vengeance contended in her eyes with the fire of insanity
yield thee rescue or no rescue or thou art but a dead man
i yield me to be true prisoner rescue or no rescue then answered de bracy in a tone of sullen submission
prince john turned pale tottered and caught at the back of an oaken bench to support himself
but to return to the assault
when the ponderous castle bell had tolled the point of noon the jewess was led from her secluded chamber into the great hall in which the grand master had for the time established his court of justice
beaumanoir tore open the seal and perused the letter in haste with an expression of surprise and horror
yield thee de bracy said the black champion stooping over him and holding against the bars of his helmet the fatal poniard with which the knights despatched their enemies
so saying he mounted his strong war horse and rode off through the forest
he appealed to de bracy to assist him in this project and became at once deeply suspicious of the knights loyalty towards him when he declined to lift hand against the man who had spared his own life
one turret was now in bright flames which flashed out furiously from window and shot hole
at length de bracy fell
an interval of quiet now succeeded the besiegers remaining in possession of the outer defences of the castle and the besieged retiring for the time within the walls of the fortress
detestable fury exclaimed the norman
maurice de bracy i say beware de bracy bowed low and in silence threw himself upon a horse and galloped off through the wood
i will not yield replied the norman faintly to an unknown conqueror
the gallant young warrior who as he fell fainting to the ground seemed to be abandoned by all the world had been transported from the lists at the entreaty of rebecca to the house at ashby then occupied by isaac of york where his wounds were dressed and tended by the jewish maiden herself
spurn this jew from the gate he said to one of his attendants and shoot him dead if he oppose or turn again
it was on their journey to that town that they were overtaken on the road by cedric and his party in whose company they were afterwards carried captive to the castle of torquilstone
but soon the conflict became even more desperate when the black knight at the head of a body of his followers led an attack upon the outer barrier of the barbican
the maniac figure of ulrica was for a long time visible on the lofty stand she had chosen tossing her arms abroad with wild exultation
wilfred of ivanhoe is wounded and a prisoner and will perish in the burning castle without present help
depart and haunt my couch no more let me die in peace
show me his chamber
the vanquished of whom very few remained scattered and escaped into the neighbouring wood
he had come the jew was informed for the purpose of correcting and punishing many of the members of the body whose conduct had of late been open to severe censure and he was recognised besides as the most tyrannical oppressor of the jewish people
go to the barbican said the victor in a tone of authority and wait there my further orders
when the black knight reached the room ivanhoe was alone rebecca who had remained with him until a few moments before had just been carried off forcibly by bois guilbert
in peace thou shalt not die repeated the voice even in death shalt thou think on the groans which this castle has echoed on the blood that is engrained in its floors
as the fire commenced to spread rapidly through all parts of the castle ulrica appeared on one of the turrets
who is there
and know too even now the doom which all thy power and strength is unable to avoid though it is prepared for thee by this feeble hand
they are fast rising at least said ulrica and a signal shall soon wave to warn the besiegers to press hard upon those who would extinguish them
tell me thy name or work thy pleasure on me
when at length the attack upon the castle was commenced all was at once bustle and clamour within its gloomy walls
the sufferer was ivanhoe himself who had so mysteriously disappeared on the conclusion of the tournament when his father cedric had sent his servants to attend him to a place of safety
with his daughter we will deal as the christian law and our own high office warrant
meanwhile the black knight had led his forces again to the attack and so vigorous was their assault that before long the gate of the castle alone separated them from those within
here is a bugle which an english yeoman has once worn i pray you to keep it as a memorial of your gallant bearing
he is already thine said locksley and well for him
what art thou he exclaimed in terror
gramercy for the gift bold yeoman said the knight and better help than thine and thy rangers would i never seek were it at my utmost need
leave me and seek the saxon witch ulrica who was my temptress let her as well as i taste the tortures which anticipate hell
the whole assembly wore an aspect of the most profound gravity the reflection as it were of the sombre countenance of the austere and relentless grand master
the life of every man in the castle shall answer it if a hair of his head be singed
showers of well directed arrows came pouring against each embrasure and opening in the parapets as well as every window where a defender might be suspected to be stationed and these were answered by a furious discharge of whizzing shafts and missiles from the walls
then the tiring women displayed zaynab before ali in the dress of the jews daughter and he went in unto her and found her a pearl unthridden and a filly by all save himself unridden
eat of it and make the like of it so he ate and fell down senseless for the sweetmeats were drugged with bhang whereupon the kazi bundled him into the sack and made off with him charger and chest and all to the barrack of the forty
moreover he took with him of his mamelukes and negro slaves and cattle all that he needed for the road and clad himself and the wazir and their company in traders gear
then he went in unto the three other maidens and found them accomplished in beauty and loveliness
when it was the seven hundred and eighteenth night
presently the prince again became impatient of the length of the way and bethought him of his beloved and recited these couplets
the knocker replied kamar daughter of azariah the jew say me is ali of cairo with you replied the brokers daughter o thou daughter of a dog
when it was the seven hundred and nineteenth night
then said the minister to the prince rejoice o kings son in all good for see yonder is the white city that which thou seekest whereat the prince rejoiced with exceeding joy and recited these couplets
now the cause of her slaying her sire was as follows
on his way he met a sweetmeat seller who was beating hand upon hand and saying there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great
on the night of his turning ali into a dog she saw in a dream a speaker who said to her become a moslemah she did so and as soon as she awoke next morning she expounded al islam to her father who refused to embrace the faith so she drugged him with bhang and killed him
then ali rose and casting the jews head down before him said may thine every enemy be like this one o prince of true believers quoth al rashid whose head is this and quoth ali tis the head of azariah the jew who slew him asked the caliph
knowest thou whither he went answered hasan i know where he is and opening the door of the closet showed him the sweetmeat seller within drugged and senseless
when it was the seven hundred and twentieth night
he destined me for literature
this hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross like a huge corpse with drooping arms
he muttered
dampness was invading it the flowers were deserting it
the grave digger walked on in front of him
a sort of letter box was constructed in the porters window the grave digger dropped his card into this box the porter heard it fall pulled the rope and the small door opened
he was a sort of laboring man who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a mattock under his arm
he had hardly the strength to stammer
father mestienne died
the sun had not yet set when the hearse with the white pall and the black cross entered the avenue of the vaugirard cemetery
it is made
he approached the grave digger
the vaugirard cemetery formed an exception among the cemeteries of paris
the man replied
the vaugirard cemetery was what may be called a faded cemetery
they were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small alley leading to the nuns corner
all at once the hearse halted it had reached the gate
but he had reverses
i have been a student
i am the convent grave digger
he who empties his glass empties his heart
the undertakers man addressed himself to the porter of the cemetery
it was father mestiennes turn
in the first place the rule as for the code we shall see
i was obliged to renounce the profession of author
the handle of a hammer the blade of a cold chisel and the antennae of a pair of pincers were visible protruding from the mans pocket
business first
heres a fine farce
the gates of the paris cemeteries closed at that epoch at sundown and this being a municipal regulation the vaugirard cemetery was bound by it like the rest
he played with father mestienne
the hearse had set out again and was rolling up the grand alley of the cemetery
make as many laws as you please men but keep them for yourselves the tribute to caesar is never anything but the remnants of the tribute to god
he was
fauchelevent burst out laughing
the permission for interment must be exhibited
this cemetery with its peculiarities outside the regulations embarrassed the symmetry of the administration
if the man had not his card he mentioned his name the porter who was sometimes in bed and asleep rose came out and identified the man and opened the gate with his key the grave digger stepped out but had to pay a fine of fifteen francs
the vaugirard cemetery was a venerable enclosure planted like an oldfashioned french garden
this indicated the immediate proximity of the place of sepulture
the good god consulted his note book which shows when the time is up
ah
after napoleon louis the eighteenth
by dint of excavating graves for other people one hollows out ones own
fortunately the soil which was light and wet with the winter rains clogged the wheels and retarded its speed
a mourning coach in which could be seen a priest in his surplice and a choir boy in his red cap followed
father mestienne is the grave digger
comrade cried fauchelevent
i passed my fourth examination
but you are a jolly fellow too
let us remark in passing that the burial of mother crucifixion under the altar of the convent is a perfectly venial offence in our sight
in the cloister what is called the government is only an intermeddling with authority an interference which is always questionable
as they must eat i cannot drink
mestiennes head adjusted itself to the cap of fauchelevents will
according to the philosophers the eternal father according to the jacobins the supreme being
the man replied
at the moment when the convoy entered the avenue leading to the cemetery fauchelevent glanced cheerfully at the hearse and said half aloud as he rubbed his big hands
fauchelevents confidence was perfect
behind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer who limped along
do you know who little father lenoir is
the grave diggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at night in winter in this cemetery they were subjected to a special discipline
chapter fiveit is not necessary to be drunk in order to be immortal
he had losses on change
the bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the vaugirard it hinted at poverty
what remained to be done was a mere nothing
you
the procession was going in the direction of the vaugirard cemetery
he is dead
the lame man who followed it was no other than fauchelevent
if a man could survive the blow of a cannon ball full in the breast he would make the same face that fauchelevent made
villager retorted the man i ought not be a grave digger
he was one of those men who though very young have the air of age and who though slender are extremely strong
i
it is so
the grave digger resumed
he limped more out of anxiety than from infirmity
it is one of the faults which resemble a duty
straight alleys box thuya trees holly ancient tombs beneath aged cypress trees and very tall grass
he was a tall thin livid utterly funereal man
their hunger is the enemy of my thirst
in the evening it was tragic there
it was suppressed a little later than eighteen thirty
father mestienne is dead but long live little father lenoir
such a thing cannot be refused
peasant my name is gribier
i am sorry for it he was a jolly fellow
the grave digger
if any grave digger were delayed after that moment in the cemetery there was but one way for him to get outhis grave diggers card furnished by the department of public funerals
what
he had the air of an unsuccessful doctor who had turned grave digger
during this colloquy which always is productive of a delay of from one to two minutes some one a stranger came and placed himself behind the hearse beside fauchelevent
the hearse skirted a clump of cypress trees quitted the grand alley turned into a narrow one entered the waste land and plunged into a thicket
i never drink
the man replied
after mestienne gribier
but he persisted feebly father mestienne is the grave digger
he was
ah said he what queer things do happen
the nuns had committed it not only without difficulty but even with the applause of their own consciences
within the last two years he had made good father mestienne a chubby cheeked person drunk at least ten times
fauchelevent had slackened his pace
the man turned round
shall we not make each others acquaintance stammered fauchelevent
completely
and he added with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well
he made him dance according to his whim
he is a jug of red wine
yes
the grave digger
he did what he liked with him
the good god said the man authoritatively
it is true nevertheless that grave diggers do die themselves
peasant i have seven small children who must be fed
and then that there was another the empty coffin
in that box
the prioress expects you
i do
the mere thought of it suffocates me
but jean valjeans coolness prevailed over him in spite of himself
and jean valjean added
that the prioress had told him to bring his brother on the following evening after the counterfeit interment in the cemetery
no i have the key to the door which communicates with the convent the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church
the hearse will drive directly up to the grave
what then
an old fellow of the old school
the coffin of the administration
six feet
the men will bear it
i will tell you what will take place
jean valjean as in the first instance contented himself with saying impossible
fauchelevent grumbled more to himself than to jean valjean
when i come to think it over the earth instead of the corpse will not seem like the real thing it wont do it will get displaced it will move about
he grumbled
about three oclock in the afternoon
the grave digger is a drunkard and a friend of mine
the hearse halts the undertakers men knot a rope around your coffin and lower you down
impossible to take a hammer and drive some nails in a plank
it stands on two trestles under the pall
i am left alone with father mestienne he is my friend i tell you
then he explained to jean valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he fauchelevent was to render to the community
it is not very near
a living person
i shall have a hammer a chisel and some pincers in my pocket
the problem is to get out of here without being seen
no
let it be a white cloth then
i shall be hungry
how long is the coffin
could you hide me in that room to night when every one is asleep
that the nun who had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed and interred in the vault under the altar of the chapel
how is it managed
that the prioress and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased
are you alone
i have none
the municipal doctor comes and says a nun has died the government sends a coffin
he is father mestienne
that he fauchelevent was to nail up the coffin in the cell raise the stone in the chapel and lower the corpse into the vault
why not
good
they will arrive a little before dusk three quarters of an hour before the gates of the cemetery are closed
me said jean valjean
fauchelevent who was seated sprang up as though a bomb had burst under his chair
i will breathe
what coffin
the prisoner is subject to flight as the sick man is subject to a crisis which saves or kills him an escape is a cure
what administration
why get out as you came in
who nails up the coffin
one of two things will happen he will either be sober or he will not be sober
the priest says the prayers makes the sign of the cross sprinkles the holy water and takes his departure
you are not like other men father madeleine
the basket will be of pine and the cover a black cloth
the grave digger puts the corpses in the grave and i put the grave digger in my pocket
any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape
every one has noticed the taste which cats have for pausing and lounging between the two leaves of a half shut door
i have said that i would put earth in it
who spreads the pall over it
what is this dead room
what does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure
moreover a coffin containing a living beingthat convicts expedientis also an imperial expedient
a man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze
and she will hold her tongue
this offers the means
when does the porter open that door
ah good you can laugh you are not speaking seriously
but that is impossible
i do
very seriously i must get out of this place
father fauchelevent we must come to a decision i must either be caught here or accept this escape through the hearse
well
you
no
there is another thing which bothers me
then you have no longer any one but me to deal with
well since there is no other means
nuns are buried in white
but you father madeleine
where is this coffin
i shall follow that is my business
fauchelevent was of this hesitating nature
jean valjean resumed
not another man except the police doctor can enter the dead room that is even written on the wall
who is there who has not said to a cat do come in there are men who when an incident stands half open before them have the same tendency to halt in indecision between two resolutions at the risk of getting crushed through the abrupt closing of the adventure by fate
the only thing which troubles me is what will take place at the cemetery
and after a silence fraught with anxiety fauchelevent exclaimed
fauchelevent went on
what church
put something in it
it is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening on the garden which is closed on the outside by a shutter and two doors one leads into the convent the other into the church
what seemed unprecedented to fauchelevent was we repeat a simple matter to jean valjean
only to allow the undertakers men to enter when they come to get the coffin
if we are to credit the monk austin castillejo this was the means employed by charles the fifth desirous of seeing the plombes for the last time after his abdication
the burial will take place at the vaugirard cemetery a little before nightfall
i answer for that
you can come and nail me up in the coffin at two oclock
what person
yes
the over prudent cats as they are and because they are cats sometimes incur more danger than the audacious
to have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bale of goods to live for a long time in a box to find air where there is none to economize his breath for hours to know how to stifle without dyingthis was one of jean valjeans gloomy talents
the empty one
you surely must have a gimlet you will make a few holes here and there around my mouth and you will nail the top plank on loosely
when the coffin has been taken out the door is closed again
you understand father madeleine the government will notice it
and how about food
the church in the street the church which any one can enter
have you the keys to those two doors
in the first place it will be a white cloth
the next day it sends a hearse and undertakers men to get the coffin and carry it to the cemetery
jean valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was raving
but how will you manage to breathe
a nun dies
what is that empty coffin asked jean valjean
if you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right i am sure of getting you out of the grave
that it was so much the worse for the government
when a great personage a marshal of france a prince a duke and a peer traversed a town in burgundy or champagne the city fathers came out to harangue him and presented him with four silver gondolas into which they had poured four different sorts of wine
on another occasion the centenarian was telling stories
it was a century which spoke through her but it was the eighteenth century
the rule of fontevrault did not forbid this she would not show this object to anyone
some unique chaplet
on the first goblet this inscription could be read monkey wine on the second lion wine on the third sheep wine on the fourth hog wine
she said that in her youth the bernardine monks were every whit as good as the mousquetaires
moral love conquered by the colic
the most curious were baffled by her silence and the most tenacious by her obstinacy
in a cupboard under lock and key she kept a mysterious object of which she thought a great deal
one of the charming little loves is already fairly spitted
she told wonders of the abbey of fontevraultthat it was like a city and that there were streets in the monastery
if she heard a footstep in the corridor she closed the cupboard again as hastily as it was possible with her aged hands
thus it furnished a subject of comment for all those who were unoccupied or bored in the convent
some authentic relic they lost themselves in conjectures
he is resisting fluttering his tiny wings and still making an effort to fly but the dancer is laughing with a satanical air
she had even been in society before the revolution
it was a faenza platter representing little loves flitting away pursued by apothecary lads armed with enormous syringes the chase abounds in grimaces and in comical postures
she shut herself up which her rule allowed her to do and hid herself every time that she desired to contemplate it
she talked with a picard accent which amused the pupils
in the little convent there was a centenarian who came from the abbey of fontevrault
she told about the custom of the four wines which existed before the revolution in champagne and bourgogne
they found the object beneath a triple linen cloth like some consecrated paten
saint terentius bishop of port where the mouth of the tiber empties into the sea requested that on his tomb might be engraved the sign which was placed on the graves of parricides in the hope that passers by would spit on his tomb
give me your orders very reverend mother
no
they shut their eyes to the truth
fauchelevent held his peace
if you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort my brother is the strong man for you
a blessed woman
his father was named tecelin and his mother alethe
did you not hear the bell
oh
there is a ring in the stone
the prioress indulged in another little inward murmur probably sacred then raised her voice
in former times we had voices in the chapter even on matters of the day
i shall have my lever
they persecute the saints
a pause ensued
when the vault is open
in lowering the coffin
what a glory of god for the community
fontaines in burgundy is a country that is blest because it gave him birth
yes
there was something of paradise in that death
i dont understand you
the prioress resumed
the prioress went on
but she will hear
all this is incontestable
under the altar
the office begins at midnight
i say more often
that is just
and the sister at the post
but the commissary of police
and miracles issue from tombs
i am here to do anything you wish
fauchelevent mopped his forehead
really
the vault under the altar
these are my orders
you will do it as speedily as possible
besides what the cloister knows the world learns not
that is true
the clock struck opportunely
the prioress who was usually subjected to the barrier of silence and whose reservoir was overfull rose and exclaimed with the loquacity of a dam which has broken away
this is horrible
she gave us her last commands
that is the only sort of key that fits that sort of door
a holy death is prohibited
she will not listen
i am a stone in your walls
now that i think of it father fauvent let us give a whole hour to it that is not too much
so be it
it must be closed again
i am entirely devoted to the convent
yes but
ah yes now i hear the knell reverend mother
a perfect turk
two men would be better
that is understood
there is no longer just nor unjust
the mothers have taken her to the dead room which opens on the church
i do not need them
no one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulture
and when the vault is open
something must be lowered into it
he will pay it at four oclock to day
at eleven oclock exactly i am to be in the chapel
be near the principal altar with your iron bar at eleven oclock
i will open the vault
it was mother crucifixion
more often
but the inspector from the prefecture
any audience suffices for a person who has held his peace too long
no
i have on my right benoit and on my left bernard
several beads of the chaplet were told off still in silence
no
i know
mother ascension will be there
has the doctor for the dead paid his visit
will that be all
we felt that she was regaining her life in god
who was bernard
she will not turn round
it cut more often short
does that prevent martin de tours from being a saint and giving half of his cloak to a beggar
each one does what he can because dom mabillon gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of saint bernard while merlonus horstius only gives three hundred and sixty seven i do not despise merlonus horstius
i have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in our lord who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life and who bear wonderful fruit
and to hold your peace about everything
that is good reverend mother
it would be a good thing to have two men for it
a silence ensued
a woman is never a man
but before that
i pay no attention to any but my own
yes reverend mother
so i shall have to nail up that coffin
the office for the dead will then be said
his order has produced forty popes two hundred cardinals fifty patriarchs sixteen hundred archbishops four thousand six hundred bishops four emperors twelve empresses forty six kings forty one queens three thousand six hundred canonized saints and has been in existence for fourteen hundred years
you will close the coffin
like yourself reverend mother
the world is nothing in the presence of the cross
fauchelevent started
for that matter no reverend mother
reverend mother
amen said fauchelevent who imperturbably extricated himself in this manner from the dilemma whenever he heard latin
more often
what do you say
fauchelevent thought that it was an orison which she was finishing
the name of voltaire is known but not the name of cesar de bus
i can hardly distinguish my own signal
and the four mother precentors will help you
about three quarters of an hour before midnight do not forget
a fine sight it would be to see a man enter the dead room
reverend mother
the slab which closes the vault
she will replied father fauchelevent falling into step and striving not to flinch again
for a clever man like fauchelevent this allusion was an awkward one fortunately the prioress completely absorbed in her own thoughts did not hear it
all will be done in the most profound secrecy
but my brother is the strong one though
the chapter assembled
this was done
you will remove your bell
your sanitary department is a revolutionary invention
into the vault
the four mother precentors will assist you
however never mind
i cannot work very fast
burial is a civil matter
precisely
the most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind
three years ago madame de bethune a jansenist turned orthodox merely from having seen mother crucifixion at prayer
a cloister is not a dock yard
to limp is no sin and perhaps it is a blessing
forbidden by men enjoined by god
at nine oclock in the morning and at all hours praised and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar said the prioress
what
to be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel not to go to profane earth to remain there in death where she prayed while living such was the last wish of mother crucifixion she asked it of us that is to say commanded us
reverend mother a lever at least six feet long will be required
it is a continuation of her slumber
the abbot of citeaux the general of the order was councillor by right of birth to the parliament of burgundy
i will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community
but you do not understand any of the peals
at that moment nine oclock struck
reverend mother you can hear the knell much better here than in the garden
the sisters will carry it to the chapel
mother ascension who is as strong as a man will help you
where
reverend mother
we may depend on you
but
there is not a chance passer by who would not be indignant to see how we are treated
no other man than you can or must enter that chamber
i have my heap of old iron at the bottom of the garden
the dead must be obeyed
what reverend mother
who was benoit
that is well
yes reverend mother
on one side saint benoit on the other the inspector of public ways
between eleven oclock and midnight you will come with your iron bar
we do not know that which it is necessary to know and we know that which we should ignore
there will be in the chapel only the four mother precentors mother ascension and yourself
the ancient magistracy agreed with him
silence fauvent
the vocal mothers whom i have just consulted again and who are now deliberating have decided that mother crucifixion shall be buried according to her wish in her own coffin under our altar
everything must have been completed a good quarter of an hour before that
you will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring
you will have an iron bar
in order to speak like you reverend mother
she continued
amen said he
we have only a woman here to help you
you know that a mother died this morning
neither do i
on one side saint bernard on the other the agent of the sanitary department
no one thinks of hell as a reality
nevertheless cesar de bus is a man of blessed memory and voltaire one of unblessed memory
we will open the vault we will lower the coffin and we will close the vault again
the state the road commissioners the public undertaker regulations the administration what do we know of all that
after which there will be no trace of anything
but i did not say more often
but
what if it became known
where will you obtain it
reverend mother
merit consists in working according to ones strength
the dead must be obeyed
more often than what
nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden
and then the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning
and then religion is attacked
in nailing up the coffin
saint benoit two in the matter of sepulture resisted constantine pogonatus
fauchelevent was but ill at ease under this shower bath
we have not even the right to give our dust to jesus christ
she went on
i will obey
i am at the orders of the very reverend community
yes
and we are to reject the undertakers coffin
i am to nail up the coffin
we have confidence in you
the prioress took off several beads of her chaplet
it is settled reverend mother
and can you get a lever
the mother precentors will be there
darkness is the rule
where gratings are not lacking iron bars are not lacking
in her lifetime mother crucifixion made converts after her death she will perform miracles
then we shall return to the cloister
oh how wicked people are
but it is forbidden
the peal which orders the doctor for the dead to be summoned has already been rung
it is not necessary that the sister at the post should perceive your presence
i am infirm that is why i require an assistant
she died at daybreak
the government will have no suspicion
the fact is attested by plantavit de la fosse
under the altar
if you had a little more faith and if you could have been in her cell she would have cured your leg merely by touching it she smiled
let us beware of god
the prioress continued
chonodemaire one of the seven german kings who entered among the gauls under the empire of constantius expressly recognized the right of nuns to be buried in religion that is to say beneath the altar
why do you say more often
she retained her consciousness to the very last moment she spoke to us then she spoke to the angels
by order of the king signifies to day by order of the revolution one no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead
reverend mother i did not say more often than what i said more often
we live in times of terrible confusion
why because there have been bad priests because sagittaire bishop of gap was the brother of salone bishop of embrun and because both of them followed mommol
see to that
only fanatics and those in error deny it
hey
the cries of the poor blanketed wretch were so loud that they reached the ears of his master who halting to listen attentively was persuaded that some new adventure was coming until he clearly perceived that it was his squire who uttered them
in which are contained the innumerable troubles which the brave don quixote and his good squire sancho panza endured in the inn which to his misfortune he took to be a castle
thou mayest well believe that answered don quixote because either i know little or this castle is enchanted for thou must know but this that i am now about to tell thee thou must swear to keep secret until after my death
i say so continued don quixote because i hate taking away anyones good name
this tempest and tribulation lasted about two hours at the end of which he was left not like his master but so weak and exhausted that he could not stand
didnt i say so worse luck to my line said sancho
i say replied sancho that i swear to hold my tongue about it till the end of your worships days and god grant i may be able to let it out tomorrow
sancho panza who also regarded the amendment of his master as miraculous begged him to give him what was left in the pigskin which was no small quantity
i would speak more politely if i were you replied don quixote is it the way of this country to address knights errant in that style you booby
it is not for that replied sancho but because i hate keeping things long and i dont want them to grow rotten with me from over keeping
chapter seventeen
then this is an inn said don quixote
and a very respectable one said the innkeeper
how can i sleep curses on it returned sancho discontentedly and bitterly when it is plain that all the devils have been at me this night
pour the bisque quite hot into the tureen in which have been placed the crawfish tails and send to the table
put this puree into a soup pot and finish by incorporating therewith the crawfish butter and season with a little cayenne pepper and the juice of half a lemon
gobeys crab stew
one has to come to san francisco to partake of the king of shell fish the mammoth pacific crab
when this is cooked pour it over the lobster and let all cook together for three minutes
this question and answer might well go into the primer of information for those who come to san francisco from the east for what is called a lobster in san francisco is not a lobster at all but a crayfish
bisque of crawfish
king of shell fish
in new york city they have what they are pleased to call lobster palaces but there is not a restaurant in that great metropolis that could approach the delmonico of san francisco in its splendid service and its cuisine arrangements neither could they approach the romance that always surrounded the ofarrell street restaurant
pick out the crawfish and strain the broth through a napkin by pressure into a basin in order to extract all the essence from the vegetables
gobey ran one of those places which was not in good repute consequently when ladies went there they were usually veiled and slipped in through an alley but the enticement of gobeys crab stew was too much for conventionality and his little private rooms were always full
a dash of worcestershire sauce just before it is taken up adds to the flavor
heat this in a stewpan and when simmering add the sherry and crab meat and let all cook together with a slow fire for eight minutes
lobster in miniature
probably nowhere in san francisco could one get lobster better served than in the old delmonico restaurant of the days before the fire
it is possible that she knows the secret of preparing crab as it was prepared in the gobeys of before the fire but his prestige did not descend to her
gobeys passed with the fire and the little restaurant bearing his name and in charge of his widow in union square avenue has not attained the fame of the old place
take thirty crawfish from which remove the gut containing the gall in the following manner take firm hold of the crawfish with the left hand so as to avoid being pinched by its claws with the thumb and forefinger of the right hand pinch the extreme end of the central fin of the tail and with a sudden jerk the gut will be withdrawn
put this in a double boiler and let cook until thick stirring constantly
when is a lobster not a lobster
pound all these thoroughly together and then put them into a stewpan with the broth that has been reserved in a basin and having warmed the bisque thus prepared rub it through a sieve into a fine puree
when it is a crayfish
allow this to boil and then add a quart of strong consomme and let all continue boiling for half an hour
put these ingredients into a stewpan and fry them ten minutes then throw in the crawfish and pour on them half a bottle of french white wine
it was here that most magnificent dinners were arranged it was here that extraordinary dishes were concocted by chefs of worldwide fame it was here that lobster a la newberg reached its highest perfection and this is the recipe that was followed when it was prepared in the delmonico
this is the recipe for eight people and it is well worth trying if you are giving a dinner of importance
chop fine the onion sweet pepper and tomato with the rosemary
soak the crab meat in the sherry two hours before cooking
serve in a chafing dish with thin slices of dry toast
i say come to san francisco advisedly for while the crab is found all along the coast it is prepared nowhere so deliciously as in san francisco
lobster served cold with mayonnaise or broiled live lobster are most frequently called for and while they are both excellent we find so many other ways of preparing this crustacean that we rarely take the common variety of lobster dishes into consideration
serve in a chafing dish with toasted crackers or thin slices of toasted bread
reverting to the original recipe take the remainder of the crawfish and add thereto three anchovies washed for the purpose and also the crusts of french rolls fried to a light brown color in butter
this butter is made as follows place the shells on a baking sheet in the oven to dry let the shells cool and then pound them in a mortar with a little lobster coral and four ounces of fresh butter thoroughly bruising the whole together so as to make a fine paste
it is as follows
reserve some of the spawn also half of the body shells with which to make the crawfish butter to finish the soup
a book could be written about this restaurant and then all would not be told for all its secrets can never be known
put this in a stewpan and set it over a slow fire to simmer for about five minutes then rub it through a sieve with considerable pressure into a basin containing ice water
lobsters and lobsters
so it was agreed that we go to damascus and fetch thence the kings son sharrkan and make him sultan over his fathers realm
if thou fear no one i fear for thee and for my life so allah upon thee recite nothing more of verses till thou come to thine own land
when it was the seventy second night
thou must know who it was seeing that thou art awake the fireman feared for zau al makan and said in himself haply the eunuch will do him some hurt so he answered by allah i know not who it was said the eunuch by allah thou liest for there is none on wake here but thou
he who recited the first time hath recited a second time and i heard him hard by
indeed i had not deemed thee so ill conditioned
if he refuse hand to him this purse of a thousand diners then leave him and return to me and tell me after thou hast informed thyself of his place and his calling and what countryman he is
when it was the seventy fourth night
then said the eunuch to zau al makan peace be with thee o my lord
dost thou not know that this lady is the wife of the chamberlain and is minded to chastise thee for disturbing her
thou wottest none can stir from his place except the watchman seize him
return quickly and linger notand shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say
so the castrato began to speak him fair and say to him o my lord take this purse and go with me
i was then sitting by his side and he seeing in her the signs of asceticism and devoutness made her draw near and take seat hard by him
they stand here between thy hands to do thee service o king of the age and it is by trial that folk are prized or despised
and when she had sat down she addressed him and said know o king that with me are five damsels whose like no king among the kings possesseth for they are endowed with wit and beauty and loveliness and perfection
they read the koranand the traditions and are skilled in all manner of learning and in the history of bygone races
the captain behaved perfectly well in this critical instant commanding a dead silence and the closest attention to his orders
the question was now whether we could pass them or not before they got near enough to grapple
mistake sir
i expected now to hear the guns discharged in quick succession but they were got ready only not fired
i never was in a better steering ship most especially in moderate weather
i doubt if we touched a man in the nearest proa
james fenimore cooper
captain robbins mr kite bear a hand up the bloody proas are aboard us
the stillness that reigned on both sides was like that of death
are numbers essential to the rightness of a cause
this conclusion is possible and in many ways attractive but it is beset with serious difficulties
the later traditions tend to extend the period
do the earliest hebrew traditions imply that the ancestors of the israelites were worshippers of jehovah
the biblical narratives apparently disagree regarding the duration of the sojourn in egypt
the training of a statesman
the excavations also laid bare a great square brick wall with the ruins of store chambers inside
but moses fled from the presence of pharaoh and took up his abode in the land of midian
furthermore the egyptian historians never distinguished the different races in their midst but rather designated the foreign serf class by a common name

the making of a loyal patriot
apparently their rebellious attitude also increased the burden which was placed upon them
a contemporary inscription also states that he founded near pithum the house of ramses a city with a royal residence and temples
the wilderness to the east of egypt had for centuries been the place of refuge for egyptian fugitives
when therefore pharaoh heard this thing he sought to him moses
the story of moses birth and early childhood is one of the most interesting chapters in biblical history
the cruel fate of his people and the painful experience in egypt that had driven him into the wilderness prepared his mind to receive this training

do you intend to kill me as you killed the egyptian
on one occasion he was at saint marys church nottingham for a confirmation
this was an infrequent material for tobacco pipes but there are a few examples in museums
no one knew what might happen next
this letter was addressed to james granger and was published in grangers correspondence
knockdunders pipe according to scott was made of iron
the affair happened in saint marys church at nottingham when archbishop blackbourn of york was there on a visitation
blackburn archbishop of york was a great smoker
oh well then i can do it in twenty minutes
the family doctor gave her cod liver oil then iron then nitrate of silver but as the first and the second and the third were alike in doing no good and as his advice when spring came was to go abroad a celebrated physician was called in
and there are indications malnutrition nervous excitability and so on
beg pardon is the yausky bridge done yet or shall i have to drive around he asked
the question stands thus in presence of indications of tuberculous process what is to be done to maintain nutrition
this is the third time youve asked me the same thing
i will talk it over with my colleague and then i will have the honor of laying my opinion before you
oh times up already and he went to the door
and how about a tour abroad asked the family doctor
well doctor
is there hope she meant to say but her lips quivered and she could not utter the question
ive no liking for foreign tours
but we may suspect it
the doctor plunged into deep meditation as though resolving a weighty problem finally his decision was pronounced they were to go abroad but to put no faith in foreign quacks and to apply to him in any need
so we were saying the problem may be put thus to maintain nutrition and to give tone to the nerves
before her he decided to scatter his pearls
and the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess as an exceptionally intelligent woman the condition of the young princess and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters which were certainly harmless
he perceived that it was no good talking to the old man and that the principal person in the house was the mother
come this way
she had been ill and as spring came on she grew worse
so we had better leave you
all her illness and treatment struck her as a thing so stupid ludicrous even
tell me everything
it seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the doctor had gone
the doctor was meantime with difficulty restraining the expression of his contempt for this old gentleman and with difficulty condescending to the level of his intelligence
yes thats an understood thing responded the celebrated physician again glancing at his watch
immediately princess
as you please
he sat down with a smile facing her felt her pulse and again began asking her tiresome questions
the mother was much more cheerful when she went back to her daughter and kitty pretended to be more cheerful
the prince withdrew trying not to show how ridiculous he thought the whole performance
well doctor decide our fate said the princess
the family doctor listened attentively and respectfully
but she could not grieve her mother especially as her mother considered herself to blame
the celebrated physician a very handsome man still youngish asked to examine the patient
she felt she had sinned against kitty
her heart was broken why would they try to cure her with pills and powders
oh no only a few details princess
the family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his observations
but
the celebrated doctor did not take offense
conceited blockhead he thought as he listened to the celebrated doctors chatter about his daughters symptoms
wasted and flushed with a peculiar glitter in her eyes left there by the agony of shame she had been put through kitty stood in the middle of the room
they ought to be persuaded
however i had finished
the celebrated doctor announced to the princess a feeling of what was due from him dictated his doing so that he ought to see the patient once more
at the end of the winter in the shtcherbatskys house a consultation was being held which was to pronounce on the state of kittys health and the measures to be taken to restore her failing strength
the prince frowned and coughed listening to the doctor
but in favor of foreign travel i would urge the change of habits the removal from conditions calling up reminiscences
the princess was distracted and did not know what to do
she answered him and all at once got up furious
when the doctor came in she flushed crimson and her eyes filled with tears
doctoring her seemed to her as absurd as putting together the pieces of a broken vase
excuse me doctor but there is really no object in this
chapter one
and the mother accompanied by the doctor went into the drawing room to kitty
ah it is
yes said he
the commencement of the tuberculous process we are not as you are aware able to define till there are cavities there is nothing definite
only those german quacks are mischievous
well in that case to be sure let them go
this argument too was well founded only some centuries ago
but we know this is what all governments say of one another and yet we know that all the european nations profess the same principles of liberty and fraternity and therefore stand in no need of protection against one another
the army has always been and still is the basis of power
except for the state they tell us we should not have any religion education culture means of communication and so on without the state men would not have been able to form the social institutions needed for doing any thing
in our day governments not only fail to encourage but directly hinder every movement by which people try to work out new forms of life for themselves
all the methods of appointing authorities that have been tried divine right and election and heredity and balloting and assemblies and parliaments and senatehave all proved ineffectual
the larger and stronger groups conquered and absorbed the weaker and the larger and stronger they became the more internal feuds disappeared and the more the continuity of the group seemed assured
to resist would need independent thought and effort of which every man is not capable
and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the iniquities practiced upon them all citizens have become their own oppressors
the effect of moral influence on a man is to change his desires and to bend them in the direction of the duty required of him the man who is controlled by moral influence acts in accordance with his own desires
indeed it could not be otherwise
this put simply is how it has come to pass
internal dissensions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression exerted by the authority over the dissentient individuals
and for the sake of what am i making them
that has always been necessary and has become more and more necessary with the increased diffusion of education among the masses with the improved communication between people of the same and of different nationalities
the members of a family or tribe united into one community are less hostile among themselves and families and tribes do not die like one man but have a continuity of existence
but the fatal significance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent in the social conception of life is not only apparent in that
both causes mutually dependent contribute to the same result at once troops are required against internal forces and also to keep up a position with other states
as the disposition of individuals to violence diminished and as the habits of the people became more civilized and as power grew more social organization demoralized through lack of restraint this advantage disappeared
governments feel that it is so and strengthen the force of their disciplined armies
in the german reichstag not long ago in reply to a question why funds were needed for raising the salaries of the under officers the german chancellor openly declared that trustworthy under officers were necessary to contend against socialism
it was produced on one hand by the natural growth of population and on the other by struggle and conquest
everyone if he does not recognize this now will know that it is so at the first attempt at insubordination or at a revolution of the existing order
anyone who serves his time in the army shares the responsibility of all these things about which he is in some cases dubious while very often they are directly opposed to his conscience
people have believed as though it were something fully proved and so needing no proof that since all nations have hitherto developed in the form of states that form of organization is an indispensable condition of the development of humanity
and this abnormal order of things is maintained by the army
government authority even if it does suppress private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the government
every government is thus involuntarily reduced to the necessity of emulating one another in the increase of their armies
but who are these evil disposed persons in our midst from whose attacks we are preserved by the state and its army
the power of the state far from being a security against the attacks of our neighbors exposes us on the contrary to much greater danger of such attacks
it has become particularly indispensable now in the face of communism socialism anarchism and the labor movement generally
how can i help asking myself when i take part in such punishments whether they are just and whether i ought to assist in carrying them out
and therefore the oppression of the oppressed always goes on growing up to the furthest limit beyond which it cannot go without killing the goose with the golden eggs
in the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interests for the interests of the group
governments assert that armies are needed above all for external defense but that is not true
but there is not only one government
all civil outbreaks for dynastic or other party reasons all the executions that follow on such disturbances all repression of insurrections and military intervention to break up meetings and to suppress strikes all forced extortion of taxes all the iniquitous distributions of land all the restrictions on laborare either carried out directly by the military or by the police with the army at their back
i am expected for the sake of the state to make these sacrifices to renounce everything that can be precious to manpeace family security and human dignity what is this state for whose sake such terrible sacrifices have to be made
and why is it so indispensably necessary
except for the state they say we should be exposed to the attacks of evil disposed persons in our own country
such has been and still is the condition of all the oppressed but hitherto they have not recognized the fact
one is the result of the other the despotism of a government always increases with the strength of the army and its external successes and the aggressiveness of a government increases with its internal despotism
even apart from the moral significance of compliance or non compliance considering material advantage only non compliance will be more advantageous in general
the time has come when the ever growing abuse of power by governments and their struggles with one another has led to their demanding such material and even moral sacrifices from their subjects that everyone is forced to reflect and ask himself can i make these sacrifices
in spite of the fact that the sense of the uselessness and even injurious effects of state violence is more and more penetrating into mens consciousness things might have gone on in the same way forever if governments were not under the necessity of constantly increasing their armies in order to maintain their power
the comparative advantages of compliance and non compliance are as follows
power is always in the hands of those who control the army and all men in powerfrom the roman caesars to the russian and german emperorstake more interest in their army than in anything and court popularity in the army knowing that if that is on their side their power is secure
indeed government is more often an obstacle than an assistance in attaining these aims
the danger of war ever ready to break out renders all reforms of life social life vain and fruitless
every increase in the army of one state with the aim of self defense against its subjects becomes a source of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies
but instead of doing that they expose the individuals to the same necessity of strife substituting strife with individuals of other states for strife with neighbors
and if defense against barbarous nations is meant one thousandth part of the troops now under arms would be amply sufficient for that purpose
so it has always been
this is absolutely incorrect
the taxes raised from the people for war preparations absorb the greater part of the produce of labor which the army ought to defend
the possibility of applying bodily violence to people is provided above all by an organization of armed men trained to act in unison in submission to one will
in submitting they simply yield to the suggestions given them as orders without thought or effort of will
and if the goose lays no more eggs like the american indians negroes and fijians then it is killed in spite of the sincere protests of philanthropists
caprivi incautiously gave utterance to what everyone knows perfectly well or at least feels vaguely if he does not recognize it that is that the existing order of life is as it is not as would be natural and right because the people wish it to be so but because it is so maintained by state violence by the army with its bought under officers and generals
universal military service was an inevitable logical necessity to which we were bound to come
only under those conditions could the social organization be justified
the most convincing example of this is to be found in the condition of the working classes of our epoch who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient times subdued by conquest
the government they tell us with its army is necessary to defend us from neighboring states who might enslave us
to keep their subjects in oppression and to be able to enjoy the fruits of their labor the government must have armed forces
nothing can oblige a man to do what he does not choose except physical force or the threat of it that isdeprivation of freedom blows imprisonment or threatseasily carried outof such punishments
so it was under the roman emperors and so it is now
without governments nations would be enslaved by their neighbors
these bands of armed men submissive to a single will are what constitute the army
and so every government needs an army also to protect its booty from its neighbor brigands
caprivi only said aloud what every statesman knows and assiduously conceals from the people
the social conception of life we have seen consists in the transfer of the aim of life from the individual to groups and their maintenanceto the tribe family race or state
even looking at it practically weighing that is to say all the burdens laid on him by the state no man can fail to see that for him personally to comply with state demands and serve in the army would in the majority of cases be more disadvantageous than to refuse to do so
the basis of authority is bodily violence
after conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to internal dissensions and so the state conception of life justifies itself but this justification is never more than temporary
the champions of the social conception of life usually try to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea of moral influence but this connection is quite impossible
so much for the comparative disadvantages
and so it has been and still is in fact in certain groups the distinction being that they are the most primitive forms of association in the family or tribe or race or even in the patriarchal state
this inconsistency has become obvious in universal military service
see footnote
the withdrawing of all men from the ordinary course of life destroys the possibility of labor itself
authority in the sense in which the word is ordinarily understood is a means of forcing a man to act in opposition to his desires
the meaning of caprivis speech put into plain language is that funds are needed not to resist foreign foes but to buy under officers to be ready to act against the enslaved toiling masses
so that the justification of state violence on the ground of the protection it gives us from evil disposed persons even if it had some foundation three or four centuries ago has none whatever now
it is scarcely necessary to refute this last argument
if the majority of men choose to submit rather than to refuse it is not the result of sober balancing of advantages and disadvantages but because they are induced by a kind of hypnotizing process practiced upon them
they are booing some one now
but surely that sort of thing is provided by his supporters and admirers said the prime minister we can hardly be supposed to supply a released prisoner with a brass band
that of course said the government prosecutor springing to his feet is equivalent to an acquittal
hence the anxiety in the crowded court and in the little groups gathered round the tape machines in whitehall and downing street and other affected centres
despite the earliness of the hour a small crowd had gathered in the street outside and the horrible menacing trelawney refrain of the fifteen hundred voting men came in a steady monotonous chant
the day after the trial there was to be a byelection at nemesis on hand and it had been openly announced in the division that if platterbaff were languishing in gaol on polling day the government candidate would be outed to a certainty
he wont go unless he has a brass band
what tune would you prefer he asked platterbaff
is platterbaff out yet
wont go
the verdict and sentence were made known to the public at twenty minutes past five in the afternoon at half past five a dense crowd was massed outside the prime ministers residence lustily singing to the air of trelawney
i hardly think so said the judge coldly i feel obliged to sentence the prisoner to a weeks imprisonment
the crowd outside chanted with an increasing volume of sound
of course any sentence which the law might feel compelled to inflict would be followed by an immediate pardon but it was highly desirable from the governments point of view that the necessity for such an exercise of clemency should not arise
ill try said the home secretary and went to the telephone
fifteen hundred said the prime minister with a shudder its too horrible to think of
the telephone squealed shrilly it was a trunk call from nemesis
will vote the other way
a telegram was brought in
the popular song of the moment replied the agitator after a moments reflection
he wont go he exclaimed
at half past seven the next morning the prime minister and the chief organiser sat at breakfast making a perfunctory meal and awaiting the return of the home secretary who had gone in person to superintend the releasing of platterbaff
without a band he would not go and they had no band
the foreman delivered his message
it was a scandalous sentence but then the judge was not on the ministerial side in politics
it was from the central committee rooms at nemesis
seven thirty amended the prime minister we must avoid any appearance of precipitancy
lend us the instruments said the chief organiser
the seat was lost but ministers had scored a moral victory
the jury returned from considering their verdict there was a flutter an excited murmur a deathlike hush
he said it was our only chance of getting a telegram radprop is in to night
the local trade unionists took offence at the fact of cabinet ministers having personally acted as strike breakers and even the release of platterbaff failed to pacify them
platterbaff must have his band
losing twenty votes per minute was its brief message
a constant stream of telegraph boys poured in through the prison gates
this is not a moment for standing on dignity he observed bluntly musicians must be supplied at once
eight oclock struck
the jury wish to add a rider drawing attention to the fact that a byelection is pending in the parliamentary division of nemesis on hand
the chief organiser rang off
the home secretary entered the room a moment later disaster written on his face
the jury find the prisoner guilty of blowing up the albert hall
that must be mckenna
the warders have a private band of their own said the governor but of course i couldnt allow the men themselves
a quarter past ten half past
they will cheer presently when they hear the news said the prime minister hopefully hark
and may the lord have mercy on the poll a junior counsel exclaimed irreverently
in heavens name why
theres a musicians strike on i suppose you know
ten oclock struck
yamleys factory hands just voted you can guess how ran a despairing message and the others were all of the same tenour
have you any band instruments of an easy nature to play demanded the chief organiser of the prison governor drums cymbals those sort of things
nemesis was going the way of reading
the seat was lost after all by a narrow majority
it was a tune they had all heard hundreds of times so there was no difficulty in turning out a passable imitation of it
we keep the drawing room locked up at night of course but anything might be carried off while we are at breakfast
a diplomat like you will know how to treat this as if it hadnt happened
besides cynicism apart his being rich will make a difference in the way people will look at his failing
from his late schooldays onward he had been possessed by an acute and obstinate form of kleptomania he had the acquisitive instinct of the collector without any of the collectors discrimination
and the reputation was an unpleasant one
the mean pig hasnt brought us a present and im hanged if he shall carry one off
i thought id get it changed for something else and now its gone
signed wilfrid pigeoncote must be the snatcher none of the others have a motor
somethings been taken out of my portmanteau
the snatcher had been an orphan these many years
wilfrid occupied himself chiefly with such of the gifts as were of antique interest carrying one or two of them over to the lamp to examine their marks
and they had rifled and despoiled his portmanteau
we feel that we must live on cream for the rest of our lives
with that notorious failing of his he was not the sort of person one wanted in ones house
brave little woman said peter with a gasp of relief i could never have done it
after they had said good night to their visitor mrs peter expressed her conviction that he had taken something
diplomatic reticence does not necessarily extend to family affairs
well we can hardly expect to he replied seeing that we always choked him off from coming to see us when he was a prospective nobody
a few duplicates of course
i fancy by his manner that there was something up corroborated her husband do you miss anything
in the drawing room after dinner their nervousness and awkwardness increased
when a man is absolutely wealthy not merely well to do all suspicion of sordid motive naturally disappears the thing becomes merely a tiresome malady
of course some of them can be changed
there are eight cream jugs now instead of seven she cried this one wasnt there before
husband and wife looked blankly and desperately at one another
there was a reason for not wanting to encourage his acquaintanceship said mrs peter
we must keep a sharp look out thats all said peter reassuringly
mrs peter kept guard outside while her husband first made a hurried and successful search for the keys and then plunged at the portmanteau with the air of a disagreeably conscientious customs official
the doctors have a special name for it
i suppose hes bringing us a present for the silver wedding
mrs peter had a final inspiration
mrs peter broke off in some confusion and tripped out to meet her husband in the hall
dont say anything more about it
seven cream jugs put in peter
yes my mothers at cairo just now and she wrote to me at dresden to try and get you something quaint and pretty in the old silver line and i pitched on this cream jug
it was mrs peter who arrived first at an inspiration
how on earth are we to know said peter
some one had taken it while i was away from the room
oh we havent shown you the silver wedding presents said mrs peter suddenly as though struck by a brilliant idea for entertaining the guest here they all are
the search usually produced a large and varied yield
you must have slipped downstairs with it last night and put it there before we locked up and forgotten all about having done it in the morning
the talk flitted nervously and hurriedly from one impersonal topic to another
vigilance was not completely crowned with a sense of victory
he must have pounced on your portmanteau the moment you went to your bath and taken the first thing he came across
mrs peter turned to her guest with confidential coyness
its all right she whispered to him ive explained everything
only the other day i went into the town to pay a bill and went in again next day having clean forgotten that id
wilfrid was late in coming down to breakfast and his manner showed plainly that something was amiss
the pigeoncotes had turned paler than ever
oh of course there is still that drawback admitted the wife but one would like to make the acquaintance of the future head of the family if only out of mere curiosity
quick fly down with it and put it back among the others
both the pigeoncotes had turned deadly pale
his hosts on the other hand wore an uneasy manner that might have been the hallmark of conscious depravity
sorry
it was a little present from my mother and myself for your silver wedding
the mention of dresden had thrown a sudden light on the situation
what a curious trick of memory mr wilfrid
i suppose we shall never see wilfred pigeoncote here now that he has become heir to the baronetcy and to a lot of money observed mrs peter pigeoncote regretfully to her husband
good lord
before tom could make the slightest struggle the chouette had emptied his pockets with singular dexterity
at one oclock
by means of this stratagem they followed so closely that although within a few steps of sarah and tom they did not hear them
do not follow us or else
are you not cold sarah
the two monsters took off their shoes and moved stealthily along keeping in the shadows of the houses
perhaps his detestation of the schoolmaster and the chouette might have something to do with this feeling
opposite saint ouen at the end of the road of la revolte the plain is wide and open
let us take off our shoes and then they wont hear us as we follow suggested the chouette
his steps which were somewhat irregular in consequence of the frequent libations of the evening were soon unheard amidst the whistling of the storm and the sheets of rain which dashed against the walls
wretch
i will bring your pocketbook
be it so to morrow at one
a dandy with moustaches
yes i would have stuck it into the fellow but he did not give me time
old boy it will pay for looking after
the chourineur resolved to inform rodolph of the danger which threatened him but how
but hell trap you chouette
what a shame
and you shall have the five hundred francs i promised you and we will agree in the other matter if you are reasonable
a concealed witness had been present at this transaction it was the chourineur who had entered the cellars of the house to get shelter from the rain
be off without looking behind you and be thankful that you have escaped so well
i am glad they have gone that way said the schoolmaster for if the cove resists i have my own idea
across the fields one may see a long way
i do not seek his life replied sarah to the schoolmaster
in an instant the schoolmaster with a leap resembling in strength and agility the spring of a tiger seized seyton with one hand by the throat and exclaimed your money or i will fling you into this hole
one moment said the chouette if he behaves well he shall have his pocketbook
what then would you have
yes
oh no he wont im up to him or any of his dodges
then the brigand pushing seyton backwards shoved him off his balance and with one hand held him suspended over the mouth of the deep excavation whilst with his other hand he grasped the arm of sarah as if in a vice
i will not give you one thousand but two thousand francs if you succeed
will you strike a bargain
i do
we can see a long way off
a sudden idea seemed to strike sarah and she said to the brigand will you like to gain some money
fire and smoke
i have only one eye but that is a piercer and if the cove comes with a companion he wont find anybody i shall have mizzled
theyre done for said the schoolmaster in a low key to the chouette out with your vitriol and mind your eye
chapter seven
he had forgotten the address of the self styled fan painter
tom seyton did not lose his presence of mind during this scene rapidly and unexpectedly as it had occurred
my pocketbook contains papers quite useless to you return it to me and to morrow i will give you twenty five louis dors said tom to the schoolmaster whose hand relaxed something of its fierce gripe
hand me the cash and i will hand you the pocketbook
we must turn back
yes
no said the old brute grumblingly no not one ring
i would go if i were you
the proposal which sarah made to the brigand respecting rodolph deeply interested the chourineur who alarmed for the perils which appeared about to beset his new friend regretted that he could not warn him of them
he stunned me with two blows of his fists and upset me on the tablefor the first time that any man ever did so curses on him but i will be revenged
agreed
perhaps we shall glean something from this smugglerthis bras rouge said sarah in a thoughtful tone and not replying to her brothers inquiry
the chourineur got up behind and at one oclock it stopped on the boulevard de lobservatoire and thomas and sarah went down a narrow entrance which was close at hand
because you have the order of charles the third and you wish to announce the good news to me
what do i say
the salon down stairs was only an algerian divan for the use of smokers
and makes you resemble the prince of wales or the duke of reichstadt
at the bois de boulogne ennui and hunger attacked me at oncetwo enemies who rarely accompany each other and who are yet leagued against me a sort of carlo republican alliance
come do not affect indifference but confess you were pleased to have it
ah true you drive don carlos out of spain
what these stuffs did there it was impossible to say they awaited while gratifying the eyes a destination unknown to their owner himself in the meantime they filled the place with their golden and silky reflections
no my dear fellow returned the young man seating himself on the divan reassure yourself we are tottering always but we never fall and i begin to believe that we shall pass into a state of immobility and then the affairs of the peninsula will completely consolidate us
it looks very neat on a black coat buttoned up
take a cigar
a quarter to ten
on the walls over the doors on the ceiling were swords daggers malay creeses maces battle axes gilded damasked and inlaid suits of armor dried plants minerals and stuffed birds their flame colored wings outspread in motionless flight and their beaks forever open
at the end of a long corridor with which the door communicated and which formed the ante chamber was on the right alberts breakfast room looking into the court and on the left the salon looking into the garden
very well at half past ten
and you another order for i see you have a blue ribbon at your button hole
however the morning of the appointment the young man had established himself in the small salon down stairs
shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate
punctuality
take her six bottles of different winecyprus sherry and malaga and a barrel of ostend oysters get them at borels and be sure you say they are for me
yes they sent me the order of charles the third returned debray carelessly
i returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep but my head ached and i got up to have a ride for an hour
it was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the house was built so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt but the well oiled hinges and locks told quite another story
it is for that reason you see me so early
let madame danglars know that i accept the place she offers me in her box
the guests
what time is it now
besides that does not concern the home but the financial department
peste i will do nothing of the kind the moment they come from government you would find them execrable
oh it is very well as a finish to the toilet
one by the post madame danglars footman left the other
i then recollected you gave a breakfast this morning and here i am
two windows only of the pavilion faced the street three other windows looked into the court and two at the back into the garden
no no my dear fellow do not confound our plans
i am hungry feed me i am bored amuse me
has the ministry resigned
on the floor above were similar rooms with the addition of a third formed out of the ante chamber these three rooms were a salon a boudoir and a bedroom
no because i passed the night writing lettersfive and twenty despatches
is the countess up yet
in the meantime my dear lucien here are cigarscontraband of coursetry them and persuade the minister to sell us such instead of poisoning us with cabbage leaves
how did these letters come said he
and what would you do my dear diplomatist replied morcerf with a slight degree of irony in his voice if you did nothing
yes ask her for one of her liqueur cellarets mine is incomplete and tell her i shall have the honor of seeing her about three oclock and that i request permission to introduce some one to her the valet left the room
this was alberts favorite lounging place
you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was half past
if you wish i will inquire
wait then during the day tell rosa that when i leave the opera i will sup with her as she wishes
my dear franz replied albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the counts assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend albert de morcerf is in danger help me to deliver him was not that nearly what you said
did you ever meet him previously to coming hither
yes
still persisted franz i suppose you will allow that such men as vampa and his band are regular villains who have no other motive than plunder when they seize your person
day for day hour for hour said albert that will suit me to a dot
i fear i shall not have that honor
is it possible exclaimed albert that you have reached your present age without visiting the finest capital in the world
i will confess to you albert replied franz the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions
why you must have lost your senses
why really the thing seems to me simple enough
i promise
whether i am in my senses or not answered franz that is the way i feel
so distinguished an individual as yourself cried albert could scarcely have required an introduction
oh pray name it
what is the matter asked albert of franz when they had returned to their own apartments you seem more than commonly thoughtful
i reside in my fathers house but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the court yard entirely separated from the main building
albert listened with the most profound attention
upon my honor
i confess he asked me none
so be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards a calendar suspended near the chimney piece he said to day is the twenty first of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly half past ten oclock
possibly
that depends when do you leave
the first words that albert uttered to his friend on the following morning contained a request that franz would accompany him on a visit to the count true the young man had warmly and energetically thanked the count on the previous evening but services such as he had rendered could never be too often acknowledged
well said he when franz had concluded what do you find to object to in all you have related
where do you live
now then franz when for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered he but asks me in return to do for him what is done daily for any russian prince or italian nobleman who may pass through parismerely to introduce him into societywould you have me refuse
to morrow evening at five oclock
i have
and now my dear franz let us talk of something else
upon your honor
it was
in that case i must say adieu to you as i am compelled to go to naples and shall not return hither before saturday evening or sunday morning
when do you propose going thither
my very good friend and excellent neighbor replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exertions
nay said the count i will give you three months ere i join you you see i make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties
and in three months time said albert you will be at my house
at last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding night and the embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum required and finally of his application to the count and the picturesque and satisfactory result that followed
how do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians
i pledge you my honor returned the count that i mean to do as i have said both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit paris
no he merely came and freed me from the hands of signor vampa where i can assure you in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and unconcern i did not very particularly care to remain
connected by marriage you mean said franz laughingly
i hope my coming will not put you to any inconvenience
he is a philanthropist answered the other and no doubt his motive in visiting paris is to compete for the monthyon prize given as you are aware to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the interests of virtue and humanity
if my vote and interest can obtain it for him i will readily give him the one and promise the other
well said franz with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation
perhaps by the time you return to paris i shall be quite a sober staid father of a family
then we shall not meet in paris
no for venice i shall remain in italy for another year or two
have you anything particular against him
the count is fond of travelling and being rich possesses a vessel of his own
still in spite of all you must admit that this count of monte cristo is a most singular personage
have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself
but as regards your wish to visit our fine city my dear count i can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please
now then said the count returning his tablets to his pocket make yourself perfectly easy the hand of your time piece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself
for france
but said franz the corsican bandits that were among the crew of his vessel
upon my word said albert i deserve no credit for what i could not help namely a determination to take everything as i found it and to let those bandits see that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world there is no nation but the french that can smile even in the face of grim death himself
certainly these are questions that in your place i should like to have answered
come shall we take our luncheon and then pay a last visit to saint peters franz silently assented and the following afternoon at half past five oclock the young men parted
have you bachelors apartments there
and where
then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colosseum between the count and vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit peppinoan engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled
albert de morcerf to return to paris and franz depinay to pass a fortnight at venice
certainly i have in a fortnight or three weeks time that is to say as fast as i can get there
what are his means of existence
the young men then rose and bowing to the count quitted the room
monsieur de morcerf replied the count your offer far from surprising me is precisely what i expected from you and i accept it in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is madenay i will go still further and say that i had previously made up my mind to ask a great favor at your hands
i am wholly a stranger to parisit is a city i have never yet seen
shall i see you again ere my departure asked albert
capital exclaimed albert your breakfast shall be waiting
of all the fierce little tartars
if i had been in uniform she would not have dared
ill soon show them that i am not going to be played with
i know
there was a low wailing sound which troubled the midshipman and he said quickly
oh
can you not believe me
yes if other ways failed he could escape up the chimney
then all round the room
you are making a mistake said archy softly
pray pray say you will not
why dont you speak sir
what else can i do replied archy sadly
to do this he must scheme lie hid till morning then make for the nearest point and signal for help unless a boats crew were already searching for him
i dont know said archy
it is not my fathers doing
i am on duty
oh
nothing else in the room as far as he could make out in the darkness and if those wretched bars had only been away how soon he could have escaped
what am i to say
they had a valuable cargo hidden in the cellar beneath where he stood and themselves to save and naturally they would not hesitate to deal hardly with him when quite a young apparently gentle girl treated him as she had done
you shall not tell
he could not help it
that my father sir risdon graeme has smuggled goods here
there was a cry and a quick rustling toward the door
he went and tried to force his head through recalling as he did that where a persons head would go the rest of the body would pass
i suppose so
cold water came on this idea directly as he recalled the fact that the darkness was intense and celia could not have seen him
but all right
there was a sound of breath being drawn sharply through the teeth and then the voice seemed changed as the next words came
looked such a nice lady like girl and all the time shes a female smuggler and must have been sitting up to let them in and lock up after the rascals had done
but there was no chance for his body there the head would not go first
i wish you would believe me that i am in as great trouble about it as you are
then an easy chair
who are you
well said archy as there was no further sound heard im not going to put up with this
and i meant to save them from trouble if i could out of respect for them all and did not believe that such people could stoop to be mixed up with rogues and smugglers
on the whole he decided that it would not be pleasant to be knocked about
there was a low burst of sobbing and the young midshipman felt his own breast swell
then why are you here
yesyesspeak
i was trying to find out about the smugglers
a narrow table against the wall in two places
a chair or two
and if he did it would only be to reach the roof of the house and perhaps find no way down
but you will go and tell all you have found out
chapter twelve
but your men
andandyou have not found out anything came in quick frightened tones
ill soon rattle some one up and he went sharply to the door felt for the handle tried it and was about to shake it and bang at the panels when discretion got the better of valour
no that was too bad
i did not come to frighten you you frightened me
do you know what this means
how to escape
next moment as he felt his way about his hand touched an oldfashioned marble mantelpiece
a fellow who was shut up in prison for life might do it he said but not in a case like this
sympathy and pity for the dwellers in the hoze were completely gone now and he set his teeth fast and mentally called himself a weak idiot for ever thinking about such people
i was obliged to come
you saw me and spoke to me to day when the dog came at me
he hates the smugglers
i never did he exclaimed after standing listening for a few minutes to see if the girl would repent and return
oh its beyond anything
dont they know that you are here
the kick he had received was a foretaste of what he might expect and after a little consideration he came to the conclusion that his duty was to escape and get back to the cutter as quickly as he could
an awkwardly shaped high backed chair with elbows and cushions
how dare you break into our house
you shall not tell
archy was silent
dontdont cry out i did not come to frighten you
suddenly the sobbing ceased and the girl said slowly
ah came again out of the darkness in a low wailing tone
the interjection came as if it were the outcome of sudden passion there was a quick rustling sound and before the boy could realise what was to come the door was closed the lock shot into its socket and he heard the grinding sound of bolts top and bottom
archy was silent
fireplacechimney
i am from the cutter lying off the coast
well he exclaimed and i felt sorry for her as one might for ones sister at home and hung back from getting her people into trouble
perhaps there was another way out and to prove that he went softly round to feel the oak panelling which covered the walls to come upon a door directly
rather hard measure by the way to deal out to the anxious girl who could not rest while shackles gang were busy about the place and had come stealthily down to open the little corner room window and watch from time to time until they had gone
ive got my duty to do and ill do it
no he thought to himself i dont believe they would kill me but they would knock me about
i must
you insolent
the answer came like a flash
not you
oh those bars he mentally exclaimed and he was advancing toward them when just as he drew near there was a rustling noise under the window a couple of hands seized the bars there was a scratching of boot toes against stone work and rams face appeared to gaze into the room by intention but into the astonished countenance of the young midshipman instead
no stop here till sir risdon comes down and tell him im very sorry that we should have cleared out last night only a born fool saw jerry nandys lobster boat coming into the cove and came running to say it was a party from the cutter
he has gone to give the alarm thought the prisoner and he looked excitedly round for a way of escape
see you for nothing middy
no im going to keep you here till the gentlefolks get up and then ill bring em round to see the monkey in his cage just like they do in the shows when you pay a penny
look here sir said archy losing his temper
it was just before sunrise too for there were flecks of orange high up in the sky
what did they sayfalse alarmtell sir risdon they would clear all away to nightsee if anything had been left aboutlobster boat
ive been shut in all night
be ready
the door was too strong to attack and he remembered the three fastenings
it was a very faint hope and one he felt not likely to be realised and he returned once more to the window with the intention of resuming his task when he heard the bushes pressed aside by some one coming and directly after the bars were seized as before
no he was not dreaming for he was looking out on the sea over which a faint mist hung like wreaths of smoke
oh said ram looking puzzled
what did it mean
but how queer for mr gurr to be talking like that to andrew teal the boy who helped the cook
here quick
why i could tie you up in a knot and heave you off the cliff any day
once out of that room he could ran and by daylight the smugglers dare not hunt him down
now a handkerchief said the gruff voice
youre mistaken said archy gruffly as he made a feeble struggle to keep up the character he had assumed
dont look a bit like a fisher lad and never will
and why did andy call mr gurr father
anything i can cried archy eagerly
you ropes end me he said
because i want my liberty
not you said the boy jeeringly
the result was not very satisfactory but sufficiently so to make him essay the bar of the window once more producing a grating ear assailing sound as he found that now he did make a little impressionso little though that the probability was if he kept on working well for twenty four hours he would not get through
who locked you in
ha
i was wondering why that window was open
tell him not to be uneasy tis all right and ill have everything clear away to night
ha ha
to his astonishment the boy did not flinch but thrust his own arms through placing them about the middys waist clenching his hands behind and uttering a sharp whistle
what a queer dream he thought to himself
what a game
he had been fast asleep and those words had awakened him
ram showed his white teeth as he burst out with a long low fit of laughter
guinea said the boy
nothing left nowhere
yes father quite
be quick theres a good fellow
he jumped up from the chair feeling horribly stiff and looked steadily round for a way to escape before it was too late
nothing but the chimney presented itself
a fisher boy
yes father
the dull sound of departing steps and a low whistling sound coming down through the skylight window into the cabin where archy raystoke lay with his heavy eyelids pressed down by sleep
whatll yer give me
i want to get away at once
the midshipman gave his head a jerk but the effort was vain for the hand over his eyes gave place to a broad handkerchief which was tightly tied behind and then a fierce voice whispered in his ear
archy stepped back to the door listening but there was not a sound
come round and open the door
but what did mr gurr mean about going home to breakfast
it would be a pity
never mind about that let me out of this place
no i cant part with that
why your clothes dont fit you and your caps put on all skew rew
labour in vain
what for cried ram
sure youve looked round everywhere boy
not you
come round and open the door
ram sprang up found a resting place for his toes and looked in grinning at him
go back aboard and put on your uniform
he gave himself a twist and was about to turn out of his sleeping place and then opened his eyes widely and stared about him too much overcome still by his heavy sleep to quite comprehend why it was that he was in a gloomy oak panelled poorly furnished room staring at an iron barred open window
just like a big monkey in a show
sure none of the lads chucked anything aside the path when they ran up
i looked well both sides
it was your turn yesterday its mine to day
what a game
he must be awake
no ive degraded myself enough he said angrily and there are sure to be bars across
it was you father kicked for shirking andmy well i hardly knowed you
will you come round and open the door said archy in an angry whisper
i say do you know what you look like
i know you
yes father
i say wheres your sword
once more will you come and let me out
it was a trap and the midshipman understood it now
here what made you dress up like that
and be stuck there and dragged out like a rabbit by the hind legs from his hole
but at the end of five minutes he stopped and thrust back the dirk into its sheath
chapter thirteen
but illyes ill give you a guinea if you will let me out
no it couldnt be a dream
go round and open the door
you laughed and fleered at me when i was on the cutters deck
like a monkey
i was shut in last night by mistake
think i dont know you mr orficer wheres your fine clothes and your sword
and im hungry too time i was up i suppose
nonsense
oh of course replied the boy grinning and he dropped down rushed through the bushes and disappeared from view
gentlemen dont fight with low common fellows like you but if you do not come round and let me out next time we meet ill have a bit of ropes end ready for you
fold it wide
shall i come too father
im going home to breakfast
turning sharply he looked about the room then after glancing ruefully at the bright little weapon halfway up the blade of a rich deep blue in which was figured a pattern in gold he yielded to necessity and began to chop at the top bar of the grate so as to nick the edges of his weapon and make it saw like
only a sham
yes
i told you a fisher boy cried archy impatiently but trying not to offend his visitor who possessed the power of conferring freedom by speaking sharply
looks comftable enough as you are
look like a wild beast in a cage
keep still or youll get your weasand slit
wont do said ram quickly
ha
there was an interval of thinking over this knotty question during which the low whistling went on
why dont you draw it and come out and fight ill fight you with a stick
no said sir risdon
one of your ship boys he said
lady graeme looked ghastly
gurr glanced round to see if the men were looking and then said rather huskily but kindly
thats enough sir but may i ask you if you do see or hear anything of such a lad you will send a messenger off to the cutter
well seen anything suspicious
surely cried sir risdon excitedly
what
but i am justly punished and never again will i allow myself to be made an accessory to these lawless deeds
gurr turned angrily away and to find himself facing dick
eh
i said a lad bout seventeen in a red cap like yours said gurr very shortly
mr raystoke sir
ah ejaculated dick sadly
mrs shackle shook her head
no noyou must be mistaken a boyish prank
i do assure you theres nothing here but what you may see
runned away
i loathe the whole business but when i saw my wife and child suffering almost from want of the very necessaries of life and the temptation came in the shape of presents from that man i could not resisti was too weak
you sir he said going towards where jemmy stood grinning
scratch them then
a lad looking like a common sailor and wearing a red cap
however sir im not on that sort of business now continued gurr sternly
i dunno muttered dick and a man cant be sure
here my lad wheres your master
now my lads forward
nonsense
gurr saluted and stated his business while the baronet who had turned sallower and more careworn than his lot drew a breath full of relief
came ashore yesterday lad of seventeen in a red cap
never mind the rabbits lads cried gurr angrily we want to find mr raystoke
i mean to have a turn at that chap master gurr sir
hi
there was nowhere else to search as far as gurr could see save the little farm in the hollow and the black looking stone house up on the hill among the trees
the men marched off and sir risdon stood watching them
youre only a common sailor dick and im your officer but though i speak sharp unto you i respect you dick for you like that lad
dont be a fool
now my lads
i suppose there is a good deal of smuggling on the coast said sir risdon coldly as he thought of his vault
dick sighed and then all at once he spat in his fist rubbed his hands together and clenched them a hard fierce aspect coming into his rough dark face which seemed to promise severe retaliation if anything had happened to the young officer
dont blame me he said sadly
what
you have seen no one he continued turning to lady graeme
i say wheres your master
no
i feel as if i had him for bout quarter hour i could knock something out of him
one of our boys is missing
i have seen no one answering to the description here
sir risdon dared not trust himself to speak but darted an agonised glance at his wife
if youd let me finish youd know said gurr gruffly
no sir replied dick humbly and the men tramped on with a couple of open mouthed barefooted boys following them to stare at their cutlasses and pistols
i do not know
no one about here would injure a boy
oh sir interrupted mrs shackle surely you are not going to tumble over my house again
oh said jemmy with a vacant look
ill let some of you see about that my fine fellows
look here my lad one of our boys is missing
seen him up here
have he runned away
boy bout seventeen with a red cap
yes sir there is and it will go hard with the people who are caught having any dealings with the smugglers
certainly said sir risdon
chucked him off yonder
you wont see him again
no sir
it is hardly right to enlist me in the search for one of your deserters said sir risdon coldly
beg pardon sir but can you as a gentleman assure me that he is not here
thank yeno dick continued the master turning back to where the men were waiting and unconsciously brushing against the bush behind which the middy had hidden himself that woman knows nothing
but he always came out again to his men with an anxious look in his eyes and generally ranged up alongside of dick
you do not know
the only way in which i could allow myself to act was to keep myself in complete ignorance of the going and coming of these people
if she knew evil had come to the poor lad her face would tell tales like print
he led his men on stopping at each cluster of cottages and shabby little farm to ask suspiciously as if he felt certain the person he questioned was hiding the truth
jemmy dadds countenance changed from its vacant aspect to one full of cunning as the party from the cutter moved off but it became dull and semi idiotic again for gurr turned sharply round
come ashore yesterday
morning marm said gurr sorry to trouble you but
in ordnary dick my lad no but when smugglers finds themselves up in corners where they cant get away they turns and fights like rats and when they fights they bites
want to find that boy
the man shook his head and stared as if he didnt half understand the drift of what was said
dont know as he has been seen about here do you said gurr looking at her searchingly
wont i muttered gurr between his teeth
good day
what for
beginning to feel scarred about him
so shall we yet sir
yes sir thats it said dick eagerly
beg pardon sir
thats right
yes sir
yes sir
yes sir
start at once sir
oysters
dirty dick screwed up his mouth as if to speak but only stared
of course well armed
now mr gurr he said im only going to say one thing to you in the way of instructions
mr gurr said the little lieutenant raising himself up on his toes so as to be as high as possible will you have the goodness to talk sense
mr gurr
yes sir said the man humbly
very ill advised thing to do
seemed in good spirits last night mr gurr eh
seems to me like going eel fishing with your bare hand
beg pardon sir didnt mean any harm
what did you suppose i thought they were
very true sir
do you think i should say a thing that was false
there arent a public house for ten miles
very unlucky sir
now then why do you want to go ashore
dont turn yourself into a figurehead of an old wreck sir
dear me
a great pity
at last the little lieutenant could bear the anxiety no longer
do you hear me sir cried the lieutenant
im getting very anxious about mr raystoke
certainly sir
you must go and find him
dear me said the little lieutenant after a few more turns up and down
smugglers are smugglers indeed
hes a tartar thats what he is
no wait
yes sir of course
shall i go at once sir
soon as the signal comes we shall push off
well sir said the master hesitating smugglers are smugglers
didnt mean that
i say sir i have only one order to give you
speak out and dont do the double shuffle all over my clean deck
yes you did sir
then i must request that you will not make it again
these fellows are very cunning but we shall be too many for them one of these days
oh yes
beg pardon sir said the master deprecatingly
yes
beg pardon sir
yes
well youre going soon as the skipper orders
no wait another half hour
keep a sharp look out on the cliff to see if mr raystoke is making signals for a boat
hang the boy
scared about whom
he swung round walked aft and began sweeping the shore again with his glass while the master and dick exchanged glances which meant a great deal
worse
no sir
now my good fellow what do you mean by that
you meant that you were getting uneasy about mr raystokes prolonged absence
yes sir but he may turn up on the cliff at any moment
it was only an observation sir
steady
yes sir you did tell me
leave to go ashore sir
i mean all alone by myself sir
i mean liked his job
i ought not to have listened to you but in my anxiety to leave no stone unturned to capture some of these scoundrels i was ready to do anything
dont see me getting out o temper with everybody and spitting and swearing like a mad tom cat
men quite ready
time we had some news of him eh
i daresay he has been there all the time only you took up my attention with your chatter
what do you want
you might catch one by accident
by this time the little lieutenant was scanning the cliffs again and the master took off his hat and wiped his forehead
then said the prior of the convent what should this drunken fellow do here
whereupon the body of the army marched forward towards a pass or ford called the gue de vede except seven companies of foot and two hundred lancers who staying there broke down the walls of the close to waste spoil and make havoc of all the vines and vintage within that place
so great was the cry of the wounded that the prior of the abbey with all his monks came forth who when they saw these poor wretches so slain amongst the vines and wounded to death confessed some of them
believe that it was the most horrible spectacle that ever one saw
nevertheless at all adventures they rang the bells ad capitulum capitulantes
the town being thus pillaged they went unto the abbey with a horrible noise and tumult but they found it shut and made fast against them
wherefore is it that our devotions were instituted to be short in the time of harvest and vintage and long in the advent and all the winter
nay said the monk the wine service let us behave ourselves so that it be not troubled for you yourself my lord prior love to drink of the best and so doth every honest man
but when those that had been shriven would have gone out at the gap of the said breach the sturdy monk quashed and felled them down with blows saying these men have had confession and are penitent souls they have got their absolution and gained the pardons they go into paradise as straight as a sickle or as the way is to faye like crooked lane at eastcheap
whence comes this to pass my masters
lord god da mihi potum
if any offered to hide himself amongst the thickest of the vines he laid him squat as a flounder bruised the ridge of his back and dashed his reins like a dog
let him be carried to prison for troubling the divine service
to others through their ballocks he pierced their bumgut and left not bowel tripe nor entrail in their body that had not felt the impetuosity fierceness and fury of his violence
to which he answered that they should cut the throats of those he had thrown down upon the ground
others shouted as loud as they could confession confession confiteor miserere in manus
by the virtue of god why do not you sing panniers farewell vintage is done
how a monk of seville saved the close of the abbey from being ransacked by the enemy
he had not only extended his empire in the west from cappadocia to the river of egypt crippled urartu and pacified his eastern frontier but brought assyria into close union with babylonia the mother land the home of culture and the land of the ancient gods
the remnant of the philistines shall perish
israel was also dealt with
he swept through israel like a hurricane
the national exchequer had been exhausted by the loss of tribute from revolting provinces trade was paralysed and the industries were in a languishing condition
if he failed in his attack on urartu his prestige would vanish at home and abroad and sharduris might after establishing himself in northern syria invade assyria and compel its allegiance
i will break also the bar of damascus and the people of syria shall go into captivity unto kir
he proclaimed himself king of sumer and akkad and king of the four quarters
supported by assyria the kings of israel had become powerful and haughty
samaria closed its gates against him although their king had been dispatched to assyria
tiglath pileser combined in equal measure those qualities of generalship and statesmanship which were necessary for the reorganization of the assyrian state and the revival of its military prestige
tiglath pileser next operated against the median and other hill tribes in the northeast
two years later kullani and hamath fell and the districts which they controlled were included in the assyrian empire and governed by crown officials
shalmaneser died before samaria was captured and may have been assassinated
but amaziah would not hear
babylon next claimed the attention of tiglath pileser
and judah was put to the worse before israel and they fled every man to their tents
take heed and be quiet fear not neither be faint hearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands for the fierce anger of rezin with syria and of the son of remaliah
the dynasty of jehu had come to an end by this time
little is known regarding his brief reign
the circumstances which made this expedition necessary are of special interest on account of its biblical associations
six months afterwards he was assassinated by shallum
a contemptuous answer was returned
in the following year tiglath pileser returned to syria
therefore the lord was very angry with israel and removed them out of his sight there was none left but the tribe of judah only
thus saith the lord
it is significant to note in this connection that the new king was an unswerving adherent of the cult of ashur by the adherents of which he was probably strongly supported
two years afterwards tiglath pileser returned captured shapia and restored peace throughout babylonia
he was welcomed in babylon which opened its gates to him and he had himself proclaimed king of sumer and akkad the chaldaeans paid tribute
the philistines and the arabians of the desert were also subdued
their most prominent leader was the prophet amos whose eloquent exhortations were couched in no uncertain terms
tiglath pileser had to content himself by devastating the city on the plain and the neighbouring villages
tiglath pileser led his army across the euphrates and reached arpad without meeting with any resistance
tiglath pileser did not overrun chaldaea but he destroyed its capital sarrabanu and impaled king nabu ushabshi
apparently hoshea king of israel pretended when the assyrians entered his country that he remained friendly
he was met with a stubborn resistance
this usurper held sway at samaria for only a month
at the beginning of his reign there was much social discontent and suffering
pekah sought to extinguish the orthodox partys movement by subduing judah
at this time the reputation of tiglath pileser hung in the balance
trouble was brewing in syria
tiglath pileser had now reached the height of his ambition
the frontier states of elam and media were visited and subdued
the walls of jerusalem were repaired by jotham father of ahaz and a tunnel constructed to supply it with water
judah had taken advantage of the disturbed conditions in israel to assert its independence
he appears to have been a popular leader of the revolt against ashur nirari who like certain of his predecessors had pronounced pro babylonian tendencies
once again the hebrews came into contact with assyria
in the spring of seven forty three b c
in seven forty b c
nabonassar had died and was succeeded by his son nabu nadin zeri who after reigning for two years was slain in a rebellion
plundering bands of aramaeans were menacing the western frontiers and had overrun part of northern babylonia
for three years he conducted vigorous campaigns in the western land where he met with vigorous resistance
for thus saith the lord unto the house of israel seek ye me and ye shall live
shalmaneser however was well informed and made hoshea a prisoner
isaiah visited ahaz and said
pekah had to deal with a powerful party in israel which favoured the re establishment of davids kingdom in palestine
the latter appeared to him to be the most feasible and judicious procedure for if he succeeded in expelling the invaders he would at the same time compel the allegiance of the rebellious hittite states
its foreign garrison was slaughtered
tiglath pileser recorded that rezin took refuge in his city like a mouse
about seven seventy three b c he appears to have co operated with assyria and conquered damascus and hamath
his son zachariah the last king of the jehu dynasty of israel came to the throne in seven forty b c towards the close of the reign of azariah son of amaziah king of judah
i will send a fire into the house of hazael which will devour the palaces of ben hadad
his return in sargons reign was evidently connected with the new rising in which he took part
he was the assyrian monarch who deported the lost ten tribes
so ahaz sent messengers to tiglath pileser king of assyria saying i am thy servant and thy son come up and save me out of the hand of syria and out of the hand of the king of israel which rise up against me
this man was evidently an orthodox hebrew for he taught them how they should fear the lord
he condemned israel for its idolatries and cried
natura abhorret vacuum
i have a remedy against thirst quite contrary to that which is good against the biting of a mad dog
there i catch you i awake you
my prenticeship is out i am a free man at this trade
my tongue peels
o the drinkers those that are a dry o poor thirsty souls
ifaith pure greek greek
long clysters of drinking are to be voided without doors
the great god made the planets and we make the platters neat
but this shall banish it utterly
appetite comes with eating says angeston but the thirst goes away with drinking
hey now lads let us moisten ourselves it will be time to dry hereafter
i have the word of the gospel in my mouth sitio
come therefore blades to this divine liquor and celestial juice swill it over heartily and spare not
this is after the fashion of switzerland
like a cardinal
are christians more temperate nearer virtuous nearer honest than savages
they are regarded as immoral
it has never made man moral temperate industrious and honest
are the failures under obligation to their creator
you cannot reform these people with tracts and talk
can infinite wisdom and power make any excuse for the creation of failures
the fourth stone is that that which cannot be destroyed could not have been created that the indestructible is the uncreatable
the second stone is that force cannot be destroyed cannot be annihilated
can we cure disease by supplication
passion is and always has been deaf
at the same time they do not want children because a child is a curse a curse to them and to itself
it follows that nothing has been or can be created that there never has been or can be a creator
we have all the links of the chain twenty six links inclusive from moner to man
they have been traced
during all these years and by all these peoples it was believed that this god heard and answered prayer that he forgave sins and saved the souls of true believers
the gutter is a nursery
did infinite goodness create the countless worthless living things that breed within and feed upon the flesh of higher forms
in this incident we see the real spirit of protestant lovers of the bible
now the questions are whether religion was founded on any known fact
we must not build on guesses fancies analogies or inferences
they depend on the lord on luck and charity
what has been the effect of christianity in italy in spain in portugal in ireland
fear bends the knees and utters the prayer
it follows that there could not have been any intelligence any design back of matter and force
afterward it was supposed that he was satisfied with the blood of oxen lambs and doves and that in exchange for or on account of these sacrifices this god gave rain sunshine and harvest
consequently there could not by any possibility have been any intelligence any force back of matter
can we add to our knowledge by ceremony
it therefore follows that the supernatural does not and cannot exist
religion teaches the slave virtuesobedience humility self denial forgiveness non resistance
they will fill homes with light and joy
reform
religion is helpless
they will be clasped with glad hands to happy breasts
we did not get our information from inspired books
would the lynchers be more ferocious if they worshiped gods of wood and stone
it has no will no purpose
could they have been worse had they had any other religion than christianity
this cannot be done by talk or example
you cannot reform these people with preach and creed
in the universe there is no chance no caprice
the greatest of human beings has said conscience is born of love
we know the footsteps of advance
according to the theologians god did not make all men alike
he takes the left hand believing it to be the right road and travels until he finds that it is the wrong one
they muffled all the bells of gladness
on the door of life they hung the crape of death
we now know if we know anything that the universe is natural and that men and women have been naturally produced
so thousands have endeavored to establish the existence of god by the fact that we have what is called the moral sense that is to say a conscience
if we build we must begin at the bottom
lips religious and fearful tremblingly repeat this passage though he slay me yet will i trust him this is the abyss of degradation
could these countries have been worse without religion
this cannot be done by force physical or moral
what is this power
has it made men nobler more merciful nearer honest
what did christianity do for them
among savages do we not find that their vices and cruelties are the fruits of their superstitions
i have a theory and i have four corner stones
think of the niagara of blood pouring over the precipice of cruelty
he retraces his steps and takes the right hand road and reaches the place desired
what was the effect of christianity in switzerland in holland in scotland in england in america
why did he create the intellectually inferior
can we conceive of a devil base enough to prefer his enemies to his friends
remember the inquisition
can we hasten or delay the tides by worship
why
can we receive virtue or honor as alms
he caused the sun to rise to steal all moisture from the land but gave no rain
man is a social being
the master cannot be great enough to make slavery sweet
science the only possible savior of mankind must put it in the power of woman to decide for herself whether she will or will not become a mother
has man obtained any help from heaven
has christianity done good
did infinite wisdom intentionally produce the microscopic beasts that feed upon the optic nerve
we have fossil facts and living forms
in other words it was just as fiendish just as infamous as the catholic spirit
if they give up one god they imagine another
failure seems to be the trademark of nature
it is fear
would torquemada have been worse had he been a follower of zoroaster would calvin have been more bloodthirsty if he had believed in the religion of the south sea islanders
the withered hands of want will not be stretched for alms
that which has not happened could not
because they have more passion than intelligence more passion than conscience more passion than reason
the babes that are then born will be welcome
men and women who think that light is the enemy of virtue that purity dwells in darkness that it is dangerous for human beings to know themselves and the facts in nature that affect their well being will be horrified at the thought of making intelligence the master of passion
most people cling to the supernatural
why then should we say that god is good
having outgrown jehovah they talk about the power that works for righteousness
being infinite he is conditionless being conditionless he cannot be benefited or injured
think of blinding a man to satisfy the appetite of a microbe
ignorance poverty and vice are populating the world
i will tell them why
the third stone is that matter and force cannot exist apartno matter without forceno force without matter
the last phase of this belief in sacrifice was according to the christian doctrine that god accepted the blood of his son and that after his son had been murdered he god was satisfied and wanted no more blood
intelligence is the only lever capable of raising mankind
in other words it proves that man has never received any help from heaven that all sacrifices have been in vain and that all prayers have died unanswered in the heedless air
the form and motion of every star the climate of every world all forms of vegetable and animal life all instinct intelligence and conscience all assertions and denials all vices and virtues all thoughts and dreams all hopes and fears are necessities
as people advance the remote consequences are perceived the standard of conduct becomes higher
can we affect the nature and qualities of substance by prayer
the next time he goes to the same place he does not take the left hand road
we know the paths that life has traveled
they tried to do away with infancy and youth with prattle of babes and the song of the morning
not one of the countless things and relations in the universe could have been different
they hated pleasure
religion does not teach self reliance independence manliness courage self defence
a man wishing to go to a certain place comes to where the road divides
they are blamed despised punished
the religion of the puritan was an unadulterated curse
think of the victims
for thousands of years men and women have been trying to reform the world
the imagination is cultivated a man puts himself in the place of another
taking the ground that it was not produced here was not produced by man they then imagine a god from whom it came
why should men and women have children that they cannot take care of children that are burdens and curses
they made cradles by putting rockers on coffins
this is the solution of the whole question
would the puritan have been worse if he had adopted the religion of the north american indians
religion has never made man merciful
man has a little intelligence and he should use it
let us be honest
take our own dear merciful puritan fathers
religion has been tried and in all countries in all times has failed
would john knox have been any worse had he deserted christ and become a follower of confucius
this in a general way is the definition of religion
can the world be civilized to that degree that consequences will be taken into consideration by all
this cannot be done by moral suasion
if a good and infinitely powerful god governs this world how can we account for cyclones earthquakes pestilence and famine
to accomplish this there is but one way
has the bible made the people of georgia kind and merciful
ignorance poverty and vice must stop populating the world
in the puritan year there were twelve decembers
man advances and necessarily advances through experience
the tide of vice is rising
there is no intelligence without force
science must make woman the owner the mistress of herself
can we say that in the heart of this god there blossomed the flower of pity
is not what we call mind just as natural as what we call body
is he responsible for all the wars that have been waged for all the innocent blood that has been shed
man has deceived himself
if we have a theory we must have facts for the foundation
we now know our ancestors our pedigree
we live together in families tribes and nations
we have the family tree
can we change winds by sacrifice will kneelings give us wealth
is he responsible for the centuries of slavery for the backs that have been scarred with the lash for the babes that have been sold from the breasts of mothers for the families that have been separated and destroyed
nature has no design no intelligence
man judges himself
when god made these different races he knew that the superior would enslave the inferior knew that the inferior would be conquered and finally destroyed
when that time comes the prison walls will fall the dungeons will be flooded with light and the shadow of the scaffold will cease to curse the earth
why
these unwelcome children fill the jails and prisons the asylums and hospitals and they crowd the scaffolds
to those who believe in the uniformity of nature religion is impossible
nature produces without purpose sustains without intention and destroys without thought
he saw the seeds that man had planted wither and perish but he sent no rain
of course it is admitted by christians that all other religions are false and consequently we need examine only our own
was there goodness was there wisdom in this
if there were no famine no pestilence no cyclone no earthquake would we think that god is not good
must the world forever remain the victim of ignorant passion
did he allow his enemies to torture and burn his friends
i do not pretend to know
among savages the immediate consequences of actions are taken into consideration
the members who add to the misery of the family the tribe or the nation are considered bad members
religion has never made man free
when the church had control were men made better and happier
why did he create the deformed and helpless
the first stone is that mattersubstancecannot be destroyed cannot be annihilated
the family the tribe the nation creates a standard of conduct of morality
religion rests on the idea that nature has a master and that this master will listen to prayer that this master punishes and rewards that he loves praise and flattery and hates the brave and free
if we say yes then i ask another question should the inferior races thank god that they are not superior or should they thank god that they are not beasts
they are praised admired and respected
it is insisted by these theologians and by many of the socalled philosophers that this moral sense this sense of duty of obligation was imported and that conscience is an exotic
they are regarded as good that is to say as moral
religion makes god a master and man his serf
whether any sacrifice of babe or ox secured the favor of this unseen god
it is a result
do we prove his goodness by showing that he has opened the earth and swallowed thousands of his helpless children or that with the volcanoes he has overwhelmed them with rivers of fire can we infer the goodness of god from the facts we know
it was also believed that if the sacrifices were not made this god sent pestilence famine flood and earthquake
the power that works for righteousness
can we say that he cared for the children of men
the prisons jails poorhouses and asylums are crowded
the sense of obligation of duty was naturally produced
the babe is not welcome because it is a burden
the members of a family of a tribe of a nation who increase the happiness of the family of the tribe or of the nation are considered good members
whether such a being as god exists
we must have corner stones
why did he create the criminal the idiotic the insane
whether any prayer was ever answered
in view of these facts what after all is religion
i say what i think
the structure must have a basement
men and women who believe that slaves are purer truer than the free who believe that fear is a safer guide than knowledge that only those are really good who obey the commands of others and that ignorance is the soil in which the perfect perfumed flower of virtue grows will with protesting hands hide their shocked faces
did infinite goodness fashion the wings of the eagles so that their fleeing prey could be overtaken
there is nothing supernatural in this
the last link has been found
is he responsible for all the chiefs kings emperors and queens
religion can never reform mankind because religion is slavery
they will be dust
fear pretends to love
they are not intelligent enough to think about consequences or to feel responsibility
poverty and crime will be childless
think of the egotism of a man who believes that an infinite being wants his praise
did infinite goodness create the beasts of prey with the intention that they should devour the weak and helpless
criminals tramps beggars and failures are increasing every day
suppose that an infinite god exists what can we do for him
he saw the people look with sad eyes upon the barren earth and he sent no rain
the hand is burned and after that the child keeps its hand out of the fire
whether he was the creator of yourself and myself
they live by fraud and violence and bequeath their vices to their children
if these calamities did not happen would we suspect that god cared nothing for human beings
we now know that our first parents were not foreigners
the present is the necessary product of all the past the necessary cause of all the future
how can we account for cancers for microbes for diphtheria and the thousand diseases that prey on infancy
he has tried that road and knows that it is the wrong road
he cannot want
what has our religion done
the sense of duty becomes stronger more imperative
these weapons of reform are substantially useless
ah where have gone all my goodness and all my shame and all my belief in the good
beware lest in the end a narrow faith capture thee a hard rigorous delusion
with thee have i wandered about in the remotest coldest worlds like a phantom that voluntarily haunteth winter roofs and snows
a haven towards which my sail is set
what said he have not the most ludicrous things always happened to us old anchorites and saints
the devil himself is perhapsskin
what
what still remaineth to me
my shadow calleth me
nothing is true all is permitted so said i to myself
thus spake the shadow and zarathustras countenance lengthened at his words
must i ever be on the way
ah how oft did i stand there naked on that account like a red crab
alas how wilt thou forego and forget that loss
it is also skin
thou hast lost thy goal
what matter about my shadow
for we ought to learn from them one thing ruminating
his great affliction that however is at present called disgust
behold thither leadeth the way to my cave be to night its guest
but they received me not said the voluntary beggar thou knowest it forsooth
he would not be rid of his affliction
who is this with whom i talk he exclaimed frightened and sprang up from the ground
who was ashamed of his riches and of the rich and fled to the poorest to bestow upon them his abundance and his heart
and verily although a man should gain the whole world and yet not learn one thing ruminating what would it profit him
but they received him not
except we be converted and become as kine we shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven
thou also
at the culprits of riches with cold eyes and rank thoughts who pick up profit out of all kinds of rubbishat this rabble that stinketh to heaven
after a little while they met a camel
let the tiger eat the man for men are the persecutors of the earth
is it fair that he should do so or not
so the brahman and the tiger walked on till they came to a banyan tree and the brahman said to it banyan tree banyan tree hear and give judgment on what must i give judgment asked the banyan tree
but the alligator said whenever i put my nose out of the water men torment me and try to kill me
how do you mean said the jackal how were you within the cage which way were you looking why i stood so said the tiger jumping into the cage and my head was on this side very good said the jackal but i cannot judge without understanding the whole matter exactly
exactly there was it asked the jackal
let the tiger eat the man for men are an ungrateful race
at a little distance they found a bullock lying by the roadside
was the cage door open or shut shut and bolted said the brahman
the brahman gave himself up as lost but again he prayed the tiger to have patience and let him ask the opinion of the sixth judge
the bullock said when i was able to work my master fed me well and tended me carefully but now i am old he has forgotten all i did for him and left me by the roadside to die
let the tiger eat the man for men have no pity
the brahman stated the case and the eagle answered whenever men see me they try to shoot me they climb the rocks and steal away my little ones
they soon elbowed him abruptly
that will be enough
in the meanwhile i will live on my clothes and my watch
his aunt did not inform his grandfather of this refusal for fear of exasperating him
in the meantime aunt gillenormand a rather good hearted person at bottom in difficulties had finally hunted up marius abode
that is good
monsieur courfeyrac answered for you
i know a watchmaker who will buy your watch
besides had he not said let me never hear the name of that blood drinker again
he declared to himself that he would not doubt and he began to doubt in spite of himself
what will you do after that
yes
in the troubled state of his conscience he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence
that is good
i do not know
whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was he could not halt there he was irresistibly constrained to continue to advance to examine to think to march further
do you want me to lend you some
the half lights of doubt pained him
silver
the clothes dealer was sent for
do you know english
never
he paid twenty francs for the cast off garments
his discomfort was augmented by all the reflections which occurred to him
have you clothes
and in the meanwhile
what opulence
i do not know in the least replied marius
the landlord presented his bill which had to be paid on the spot
at that moment he had three francs left
whither would this lead him
it is badly paid work but one can live by it
he feared after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father to now take a step which should estrange him from that father
and my boots
he bought the watch for forty five francs
marius was gloomy
an escarpment rose around him
because one of my friends a publisher is getting up a sort of an encyclopaedia for which you might have translated english or german articles
gold here it is
and the hotel bill observed courfeyrac
courfeyrac having made his appearance the host left them
i have ten francs left said marius
so much the worse
he affirmed to himself that he would not
they went to the watchmakers
request courfeyrac to come and talk with me said marius
have you any money
marius was clear eyed and he required the true light
why
have you trinkets
but i must have my money
what is to become of you said courfeyrac
what are you going to do
no it is not good
you will then have only a pair of trousers a waistcoat a hat and a coat
whatever is necessary
he ceased to go to the cafe musain
here is what i have
a watch
that is not bad said marius to courfeyrac on their return to the hotel with my fifteen francs that makes eighty
do you know german
anything honest that is to say
to stand between two religions from one of which you have not as yet emerged and another into which you have not yet entered is intolerable and twilight is pleasing only to bat like souls
that will be swallowing a tongue very fast or a hundred sous very slowly
fifteen francs
at last he raised the net to let the beast go free
the peasant was there and the shepherd and the lords and beggars and high born dames all those whom ethelried had ever befriended
while he stood looking around him in bewilderment a firefly alighted on his arm
the art of rhyming had been neglected in his early education and it was not until the first cock crowing began that he succeeded in making this one
he could hear frog eye fearsome snoring like a tempest up in the watch tower and the old witch was talking in her sleep in seven languages
they were brave men and they would not have feared to meet the fiercest wild beasts but many shrunk back when the ogre came rushing out
so the ogre was killed and the prince came into his kingdom that was his hearts desire
then he sank on his knees in astonishment
bang
giant scissors serve me well and save me from the witchs spell
he found my lamb cried another
but the king laughed him to scorn
now just at that moment it happened that the court tailor came into the room to measure the king for a new mantle of ermine
still the beautiful princess languished in her prison
at this moment there was a distant rumbling as of thunder
see him laughed one of the brothers that was dark to one that was fair
they would not acknowledge their fear
once across that they would be out of his power but it seemed impossible to cross
farewell
by the time he reached the edge of the forest he was very tired and ready to faint from hunger
day by day the scissors grew sharper and sharper and ever more quick to spring forward at his bidding
forthwith the grinning jester began shrieking with laughter so that the bells upon his motley cap were all set a jangling
when he had cut it loose and carried it home the shepherd also became his firm friend and would have gone through fire and water to serve him
what is to become of me cried the poor peasant
they were so rusty from long idleness that he could scarcely move them
my grain must fall and rot in the field from overripeness because i have not the strength to rise and harvest it then indeed must we all starve
while he stood gazing at the struggling beast it turned to him with such a beseeching look in its wild eyes that he was moved to pity
so he set to work with the little scissors to cut the great ropes of the net in twain
so ethelried left the palace and wandered away over mountain and moor with a heavy heart
giant scissors rise in power grant me my hearts desire this hour
the prince spent all the following time until midnight trying to think of a suitable verse to say to the scissors
he dashed across the drawbridge and opening his scissors cried
but the next morning no one came to take him to the gallows and he sat all day in total darkness
but know that the scissors move only when bidden in rhyme
the grandame whom he supplied with fagots the merchant whom he rescued from robbers the kings councillor to whom he gave aid all became his friends
again the scissors grew longer and longer until they lay across the chasm like a shining bridge
we must hasten seizing the scissors that lay on the ground where ethelried had dropped them she opened and shut them several times exclaiming
giant scissors bridge the path and save us from the ogres wrath
better dead than this craven life to which my father hath doomed me
it was the fly which had alighted on his shoulder
the scissors hung useless and rusting by his side
i did but laugh to think the sword of ethelried had been so quickly found responded the jester and he pointed to the scissors hanging from the tailors girdle
the whole field was cut by sunrise
until that far day now get thee gone
presently as he worked the blades began to grow sharper and sharper and brighter and brighter and longer and longer
and so they went on each telling of some unselfish service that the prince had rendered him
flashing its little lantern in the princes face it cried this way
great beads of sweat stood out on his brow as he bent himself to the task
my friend the fly sent me to guide you to a place of safety
they did not know his name they did not know that he was prince ethelried but they knew by his valor that there was royal blood in his veins
well you shall never steal again that i promise you
your prison door is of iron but the shutter which bars the window is only of wood
soon he came to a tiny hut where a sick man lay moaning while his wife and children wept beside him
he comes afoot no prancing steed no waving plumes no trusty sword little and lorn he is not fit to be called a brother to princes
throwing himself on his knees before the king he cried oh royal sire bestow upon me also a sword and a steed that i may up and away to follow my brethren
by the light of the moon he saw that a ferocious wild beast had been caught in a hunters snare and was struggling to free itself from the heavy net
one by one their brave heads were cut off and stuck on poles along the moat that surrounded the castle
follow me and trust entirely to my guidance
it was he who changed me into the form of a wild beast and set the snare to capture me
keep all but the princess
in a very short time the prince had crawled through the opening
scissors grow a giants height and save us from the ogres might
to him who could bring her back to her fathers castle should be given the throne and kingdom as well as the princess herself
tis the ogre cried the fairy
but ethelried heeded not their taunts
before he could thank her she had vanished and he was left in the forest alone
every cap was thrown up and such cheering rent the air as has never been heard since
ethelried hurried across after the fairy trembling and dizzy for the ogre was now almost upon them
nay he said
i shall make my escape thereat and go to repay thy unselfish service to me
as soon as they were safe on the other side the fairy blew upon the scissors and presto they became shorter and shorter until they were only the length of an ordinary sword
his first thought was to slay the animal for he had had no meat for many days
just then he spied a tree hanging full of great yellow apples
thou a sword he quoth
no one knew that he was a prince no fireside offered him welcome no lips gave him a friendly greeting
the sight was so terrible that he turned on his heel and fled away as fast as his feet could carry him
but remember that thou canst not keep them sharp and shining unless they are used at least once each day in some unselfish service
the fairy darted down the path thus opened up and ethelried followed as fast as he could for the horrible roaring was rapidly coming nearer
however he toiled on all night slowly cutting down the grain stalk by stalk
again the fairy touched the scissors saying
he was thrust into the dungeon and left there all day
he had spent his last coin and knew not where to go for another
towards morning the scissors became brighter and sharper until they finally began to open and shut of their own accord
what now fool demanded the king
he saved my harvest cried one
one day a herald dashed down the highway shouting through his silver trumpet that a beautiful princess had been carried away by the ogre
one night as he lay in a deep forest too unhappy to sleep he heard a noise near at hand in the bushes
but escape is possible
by this time a great many people attracted by the terrific noise had come running up to the moat
when the poor prince saw his brothers riding out into the world to win their fortunes he fain would have followed
they said we are only waiting to lay some wily plan to capture the ogre
after several days ethelried reached the place on foot
there he stood outside the dungeon but it was a dark night and he knew not which way to turn
the prince flung his mantle over his shoulder and followed on with all possible speed
at last they reached a wide chasm that bounded the ogres domain
among those who drew back were ethelrieds brothers the three that were dark and the three that were fair
it was dull work
wylder was surprised puzzled and a good deal incensedthat saucy craft had fired her shot so unexpectedly across his bows
marks ideas of ladies and of propriety were low and he was little better than a sailor ashore and not a good specimen of that class of monster
chapter four
what thing
he assisted at it but took no part and in fact was listening to that other conversation which sounded with its pleasant gabble and laughter like a little musical tinkle of bells in the distance
in which we go to the drawing room and the party breaks up
he would have liked at that moment a walk upon the quarter deck with a good head wind blowing and liberty to curse and swear a bit over the bulwark
after a while in a pet he walked away
so mark waited to put the lady into the carriage and he meditated walking a little way by the window and making his peace and there was perhaps some vague vision of jumping in afterwards i know not
he would have talked to ugly mrs w wylder his sister in law at his left but she was entertaining lord chelford now
his gall rose and that distant talk rang in his ears like a cool but intangible insult
my dear miss lake said that good little woman skipping to her side
the story of fridolin and retzchs pretty outlines
wylder was rather surly after the ladies had floated away from the scene and he drank his liquor doggedly
mark clapped on his hat and rifled the pocket of his paletot of his cigar case and matches and spluttered a curse or two according to old nollekins receipt for easing the mind and on the door steps lighted his cheroot and became gradually more philosophical
sit down beside me and ill tell you the story
women are so full of caprice and hypocrisy and humbugging impudence
it was his fancy i suppose to revive certain sentimental relations which had it may be once existed between him and miss lake and he was a person of that combative temperament that magnifies an object in proportion as its pursuit is thwarted
then he joined a conversation going on between dorcas brandon and the vicar his brother
once more then i tell you that i feel quite able to execute this statue three times better than the model as i have before engaged my word
i felt compelled to complain pretty sharply to his excellency and having gone to wait on him one morning in the via de servi i spoke as follows my lord i do not now receive the monies necessary for my task which makes me fear that your excellency has lost confidence in me
i had to pay the workmen out of my own pocket for the duke after giving lattanzio gorini orders to discharge their wages at the end of about eighteen months grew tired and withdrew this subsidy
now grant me my permission prince
as i thought that this was due to some fault in the earth i wanted to make these first experiments before i undertook my perseus
perceiving at once how base the business would be i exclaimed fear not vile coward
i frequently replied that everybody nay all italy knew well i was an excellent goldsmith but italy had not yet seen what i could do in sculpture among artists certain enraged sculptors laughed at me and called me the new sculptor
it is true that he lent me a pair of old scales two anvils and three little hammers which articles i begged his workman giorgio da cortona fifteen days ago to fetch back
the first cast i took in my furnace succeeded in the superlative degree and was so clean that my friends thought i should not need to retouch it
one thinks that you will never get it done in a rage i up and answered may the plague catch you and all who dare to think i shall not finish it
domenico poggini and gianpagolo his brother who are present will confirm my words for i spoke to them at once about it and since that time have never once alluded to the matter because your excellency told me i did not understand these things which made me think you wanted to keep up the credit of your stone
thereupon i recovered command of my faculties and thanked god that his goodness had withheld me from so great an act of violence
i was of course aware that the admirable sculptor donatello had cast his bronzes with the clay of florence yet it seemed to me that he had met with enormous difficulties in their execution
taking the road toward florence just when i entered the piazza of san domenico bandinello was arriving from the other side
then i made my suit to her and prayed her tell the duke that i was getting small assistance for so great a work i begged her also to warn him not to lend so ready an ear to bandinello s evil tongue which hindered me from finishing my perseus
i shall not try to rob you of eight or ten thousand ducats at one go but shall rather seek to earn them by my industry
on taking leave he would not let me go but held me with his little hands and a tempest of cries and tears
the duke hearing something of these disputes sent for the vase and the models and never told me why or wherefore suffice it to say that he placed some of my designs in the hands of divers persons at venice and elsewhere and was very ill served by them
i moved heaven and earth to get back the body of the vase which he had begun badly as i have already said together with the remainder of the silver
but as i suppose your excellency is joking i will add no more he replied that far from joking he meant solemn earnest
i have mentioned one i said my lord i thank you and beg you to condescend so far as to listen to four words
chap
i believe have already narrated how domenico and giovanpagolo poggini goldsmiths and brothers were at work in the duke s wardrobe upon some little golden vases after my design chased with figures in bas relief and other ornaments of great distinction
i do not condescend to smite you he looked at me submissively and said nothing
i asked lattanzio why he did not pay me as usual
when i took them to her excellency she received me most graciously and repaid the gold and silver i had spent upon them
the first piece i cast in bronze was that great bust the portrait of his excellency which i had modelled in the goldsmith s workroom while suffering from those pains in my back
to prove the truth of these words i need only remind your excellency of donatello and the great lionardo da vinci in the past and of our incomparable michel angelo buonarroti in the present they augment the glory of your excellency by their genius i in my turn feel the same desire and hope to play my part like them therefore my lord give me the leave to go
when i reached the house i found the boy in good health and kissed him very sad at heart
there
i should like you to know my lord that i do understand and that as regards my character i consider myself no less honest than any man who ever lived upon this earth
she then desired me to fasten it upon her breast and handed me a large pin with which i fixed it and took my leave in her good favour
you had better put this to the proof and i will go at once to the bargello the duke made answer benvenuto do your best to be an honest man as you have done until now you have no cause for apprehension so the whole matter passed off in smoke and i heard not one more word about it
no sooner did he catch sight of me than he turned the colour of a corpse and trembled from head to foot
he kept indeed enticing me to push this job forward by daytime also but i would not consent although i felt sure i should incur his anger
one day on one of these occasions i mounted a nice nag i had put a hundred crowns in my purse and went to fiesole to visit a natural son of mine there who was at nurse with my gossip the wife of one of my workpeople
i can no sooner give you some little hints whereabouts they live but you know them presently and i meant you should be beholding to me for your acquaintance
you had strange luck to meet my brother so soon
i lent it most willingly and gone he is
you have been there i am sure
i never deserved a long letter so much as now when you sent me a short one
shes cruel and how far her power may reach i know not only i am sure she cannot call back time that is past and it is long since we resolved to be for ever
forgive me that this is no longer for
if anything could be wonderd at in this age i should very much how you came by your informations
you will think him altered and if it be possible more melancholy than he was
i am your
my father has lost his too and my eldest brother but we all look like people risen from the dead
but besides i can give you others
well twas a pretty lecture and i grew warm with it after a while in short we came so near an absolute falling out that twas time to give over and we said so much then that we have hardly spoken a word together since
i think my youngest brother comes down with him
all that is to be hoped is that since he may reduce whomsoever he pleases to his obedience he will be very curious in his choice and then i am secure
do you know him
but it seems this gentleman is not so easy access but you may acknowledge something due to me if i incline him to look graciously upon you and therefore there is not much harm done
i knew you could not choose but like her but yet let me tell you you have seen but the worst of her
but i am hugely pleased that you have seen my lady
if marriage agrees no better with other people than it does with him i shall pray that all my friends may scape it
yet if i were my cousin h danvers my lady diana should not if i could help it as well as i love her i would try if ten thousand pound a year with a husband that doted on her as i should do could not keep her from being unhappy
i have no company now but my niece peyton and my brother will be shortly for the term but will make no long stay in town
in earnest we have had such a skirmish and upon so foolish an occasion as i cannot tell which is strangest
ill swear her friends are much to blame to let her go abroad
he went up but last tuesday
i have no room for more than
it may be i dreamt it that you had met my brother or else it was one of the reveries of my ague if so i hope i shall fall into no more of them
but i thank god an imagination took him one morning that he was falling into a dropsy and made him in such haste to go back to cambridge to his doctor that he never remembers anything he has to ask of me but the coach to carry him away
only my cousin molle keeps his still and in earnest i am not certain whether he would lose it or not for it gives him a lawful occasion of being nice and cautious about himself to which he in his own humour is so much inclined that twere not easy for him to forbear it
tis more than i know if mr freeman be my servant
my best qualities if i have any that are good served but for aggravations of my fault and i was allowed to have wit and understanding and discretion in other things that it might appear i had none in this
but thats in nobodys power and my lady talmash that says she can do whatsoever she will cannot believe whatsoever she pleases
is it true
i wonder how she behaved herself when she was married
because you find fault with my other letters this is like to be shorter than they i did not intend it so though i can assure you
i cannot talk ont at the rate that you do
how long this letter will be i cannot tell
i make it a case of conscience to discover my faults to you as fast as i know them that you may consider what you have to do
i know not how he may be prejudiced as to the business but he is not deaf to reason when tis civilly delivered and is as easily gained with compliance and good usage as anybody i know but by no other way
however tis not amiss that my will made you know now how to dispose of all my wealth whensoever i die
directed for your master
we go abroad all day and play all night and say our prayers when we have time
you shall have all the time that is allowed me but upon condition that you shall not examine the sense ont too strictly for you must know i want sleep extremely
tis a miracle to me how my brother endures it
he is so amongst his children too though he loves them passionately
how welcome you will be but alas
he has certainly as great a kindness for her as can be and to say truth not without reason but all the people that ever i saw i do not like his carriage towards her
all this is perfect nonsense in their opinion but i should not doubt the convincing them if i could hope to be so happy as to be
would it would leave me and then i could believe i shall not always have occasion for it
you have no such ladies in ireland
yours
my aunt told me no longer agone than yesterday that i was the most wilful woman that ever she knew and had an obstinacy of spirit nothing could overcome
well in sober earnest now i would not live thus a twelvemonth to gain all that the king has lost unless it were to give it him again
he is perpetually wrangling and finding fault and to a person that did not know him would appear the worst husband and the most imperious in the world
if i drown by the way this will be my last letter and like a will i bequeath all my kindness to you in it with a charge never to bestow it all upon another mistress lest my ghost rise again and haunt you
the sun was up an hour before i went to bed to day and this is not the first time i have done this since i came hither
my humour is so ill at present that i dare say no more lest you chide me again
i do not find it though i am told i was so extremely when i believed you loved me
that i would not find and you have only power to make me think it
my poor lady vavasour is carried to the tower and her great belly could not excuse her because she was acquainted by somebody that there was a plot against the protector and did not discover it
take heed you see i give you fair warning
but i am called upon
indeed i like him extremely and he is commended to me by people that know him very well and are able to judge for a most excellent servant and faithful as possible
i told them i knew no remedy but leaving me behind next time and could have told them that my looks were suitable to my fortune though not to a feast
i am beginning it to day and have chosen to go as far as gravesend by water though it be very gloomy weather
he came down into the country where she was upon a visit and one morning married her
do not take it ill for i would endure it if i could rather than fail but in earnest i do not think it were possible for me
i told you in my last that my suffolk journey was laid aside and that into kent hastened
the less one knows of state affairs i find it is the better
my next shall make amends for this short one
i am got into my complaining humour that tires myself as well as everybody else and which as you observe helps not at all
pray let me know whether your man leaves you and how you stand inclined to him i offer you
here are some verses of cowleys
tis the pleasantest thing that can be to hear us discourse
tell me how you like them
the captain coming in shortly after the sudden flight of the gamblers took charge of the money and the next day restored it to the owners
yes i do
i tell you this is growing serious whispered one in a shaking voice his very lips white with fear
i think not very
and how wonderfully he has answered our petitions
that fellow nick ward is a noted blackleg and ruffian had his nose broken in a fight and is sensitive on the subject was cheating of course
is it strange then that smokers and chewers have a thousand ailments that german physicians attribute one half of the deaths among the young men of that country to tobacco
permission was given and the next moment the two stood close together each gazing admiringly into the others face
ill have no fighting aboard
then franks papa came for him saying the air was growing very cool and it was time to go in
hence a resort to cider and beer
they bent eagerly over the board each watching with feverish anxiety his companions movements each casting now and again a gloating eye upon the heap of gold and greenbacks that lay between them and at times half stretching out his hand to clutch it
and i remarked travilla abandoned its use about the same time that dinsmore did and for the same reasons
frank looked inquiringly at his father
and then such powerful acids produce intense irritation and thirstthirst which water does not quench
but surely those were rare cases
let me go yelled ward making a desperate effort to free his arms
cousin ronald took frank on his knee and asked what are you going to do my little fellow when you get to be a man
yes indeed she said bending down to kiss frank and stroke his hair
yet there was gambling again the second night between ward and several others of his profession
i wonder which of us it is remarked the first looking hard at our party
the half dozen cigars which most smokers use a day contain six or seven grainsenough if concentrated and absorbed to kill three men and a pound of tobacco according to its quality contains from one quarter to one and a quarter ounces
how dare you sir
to elsies observant eyes it presently became evident that the dalys were in very straitened circumstances
there was a pause broken by young horace who had been watching a group of men gathered about a table at the further end of the room
some effort must be made and he started up as if with the intention of approaching the players
this time the voice seemed to come from a stateroom behind the gambler towering with rage he rushed to the door and tried to open it
ah ha um hm ah ha
our friends were of the same opinion and all repaired to the ladies saloon where through the children they and the dalys soon made acquaintance
yes you may go if you wish returned the latter and the two started off hand in hand
failing in that he demanded admittance in loud angry tones at the same time shaking the door violently and kicking against it with a force that seemed likely to break in the panels
mr daly was a minister going south for the winter for the sake of his own and his wifes health
there are some nice looking people on board remarked mr travilla in an undertone to his wife
she consulted with her husband and the result was a warm invitation to the dalys to spend the winter at viamede where they would have all the benefit of the mild climate congenial society use of the library horses etc and be at no expense
thats strongly put remarked mr lilburn reflectively
thank you no i dont smoke
rather comical i think my man
it came from under the table gasped ward look whats there
wheres that dutch villain ward was screaming following up his question with a volley of oaths
it was the last game of cards for that trip
his name is fank said harold
they heard him in silence with a cool phlegmatic indifference most exasperating to one in his present mood
mr daly smiled
they kept it up till after midnight
then mr lilburn waking from his first sleep in a stateroom near by thought he would break it up once more
by the way i met with a very strong article on the subject lately which i cut out and placed in my pocket book
one of the direct effects of tobacco is to weaken the heart
im afraid ill have to give it up
there was nothing there
mamma see
suppose you and he shake hands frank
look yourself
the words had scarcely passed his lips when a voice spoke apparently close at the villains side
isnt he a dear little boy asked harold leading his new friend up before her with an air of proud ownership
the more this thirst is fed the more insatiate it becomes and more fiery drink is needed
i dont know but come on
who are you cried the rascal starting up white with rage and turning to face his accuser
ah ha um hm
i have never used the weed in any way said horace junior
yes sir said the child holding out a small plump hand whats your name little boy
ah ha um hm suppose you give us the benefit of it suggested lilburn good naturally im open to conviction
who was it
do you son was the smiling rejoinder
doubtless that is the case remarked mr dinsmore
beside ourselves added cousin ronald laughing
lets follow and see the fun
what does it mean cried one
he certainly looks like a very nice little boy
the ladies were weary and retired to their state rooms shortly after tea but the gentlemen sought the open air again and paced the deck for some time
i never knew before said he that my boy intended to follow my profession
a deep groan startled them and they sprang to their feet pale and trembling with sudden terror each holding his breath and straining his ear to catch a repetition of the dread sound
oh nonsense what fools we are of course somebodys ill in one of the state rooms and they resumed their game for the second time
the eyes of the whole party were at once turned in that direction
stay a moment exclaimed lilburn in an undertone and laying a detaining hand upon travillas arm but with his gaze intently fixed upon the older gamester
no sir they dont laugh when papa says it
dont you like this nice big boat
have a cigar sir asked mr lilburn addressing mr daly
yes she answered that little group yonder a young minister and his wife and child i suppose
yes frank daly
i saw him slip a card from his coat sleeve
yes mamma chimed in the last named young gentleman hes a nice little boy
the articles of impeachment against strafford are twenty eight in number and regard his conduct as president of the council of york as deputy or lieutenant of ireland and as counsellor or commander in england
strafford was obliged to speak with deference and reserve towards his most inveterate enemies the commons the scottish nation and the irish parliament
the question before the council was offensive or defensive war with the scots the king proposes this difficulty but how can i undertake offensive war if i have no more money
the answer ascribed to strafford was in these words borrow of the city a hundred thousand pounds go on vigorously to levy ship money
where has this species of guilt lain so long concealed said strafford in conclusion
the accusation and defence lasted eighteen days
in the government of ireland his administration had been equally promotive of his masters interest and that of the subjects committed to his care
your majesty having tried the affections of your people you are absolved and loose from all rules of government and may do what power will admit
and now my lords i thank god i have been by his blessing sufficiently instructed in the extreme vanity of all temporary enjoyments compared to the importance of our eternal duration
some instances of imperious expressions and even actions may be met with
but discretionary authority during that age was usually exercised even in england
your majesty having tried all ways shall be acquitted before god and man
impose not my lords difficulties insurmountable upon ministers of state nor disable them from serving with cheerfulness their king and country
in ireland it was still more requisite among a rude people not yet thoroughly subdued averse to the religion and manners of their conquerors ready on all occasions to relapse into rebellion and disorder
the case of lord mountnorris of all those which were collected with so much industry is the most flagrant and the least excusable
let us not to our own destruction awake those sleeping lions by rattling up a company of old records which have lain for so many ages by the wall forgotten and neglected
no imputation of rapacity could justly lie against his administration
but you have only just come you can easily manage and in any case even if you fail
what can she be doing out by herself
just after midnight she rose with a sigh to prepare for bed
dont talk any more
leslie opened it and followed her
drink that she said
oh now i remember she got a letter which upset her very much and went out
but leslie was a healthy girl she had been well trained she had plenty of self possession and an abundance of strong common sense
freshers
i must pass in honors if i dont i shall die
dont say a word
cant you manage with a candle just for once
dear dear where can she be
dont begin
i find these modern languages so very stiff
yes i must find her without delay
annie did not hear it leslie opened the door
now drink this at once she said in a voice of authority if you really wish to sleep
there is nothing for it but for me to go and look for her she said to herself
annie did not smile
i want to sleep
a few moments later there came a tap at the door
in order to avoid such a catastrophe she divided her hours carefully allowing a certain amount for recreation and a certain amount also for the guiding of her wayward companion to whom as the days went on she became really attached
her face grew suddenly white as death
she had no idea of allowing herself to break down
jane heriot stood without
i am so glad that you have got one at last
she crushed the letter up tight thrust it into her pocket and said abruptly what is the hour
there was no doubt that she had got a shock but of what nature leslie could not in the least make out there was no help for it however
i shall goi know a way
these letters have just come for you and annie colchester she said and as i was coming upstairs i thought i would leave them with you
dear me annie she said i was quite frightened about you
i shall go off to sleepthat is all i care for
leslie did not venture to say any more
she looked round the room
have you had bad news said leslie
as she intended to aim at a first or at least second class her range of study was very wide and german french and italian literature had to be more or less understood in order to give her a thorough and complete grip of her subject
she ventured to call annies name softly there was no reply
leslie seated herself with her back to her companion and opened her own letters
annies manner was very mysterious
it can never mean the same to you she said at last in a solemn voice and then she looked down again at her book pushed her hands through her red locks and resumed her contemplation of the problem which lay before her
i do not mean to fail any more than you do replied leslie
why you will be parting from me you know
they joined the tennis racquets and boating clubs eileen and marjorie having submitted to the necessary test were made full blown members of the latter club immediately
what are you studying now asked annie
i only want to get into bed and to sleep
but she added abruptly you speak of something which must not take place
i must go into the grounds the air is stifling
leslie had to take a few swimming lessons before she could do so
she lit the little spirit lamp put on the milk to boil and prepared the cocoa as usual
i wont be the constant worry and plague of your life
well read it in peace said leslie
in any case you are quite certain to wish for another room and to get it also next term
after a time she looked round
what do you mean
leslie thanked her and eagerly grasped the little parcel
her queer red brown eyes with their distended pupils gazed straight before her
if i do remain therefore i shall be plagued with some terrible student of the florrie smart or jane heriot style
i am truly glad it has come
her eyes shone with pleasure at the anticipation of the delightful time she would have reveling in the home news the other letter was directed to annie colchester
she turned off the light and lit a candle which she put behind her screen then prepared to get into bed
she got into bed as she spoke and wrapped the clothes tightly round her
annies eyes were very bright her cheeks were no longer pale and there was a brilliant color in them she did not take the least notice of leslie but going into the room shut the door
ill be back presently
there was no sign of annie colchester
she shut the window
poor girl she spoke of it as cold water to the thirsty she looked when i saw her last as if it had half killed her
the course is enormous and i am sometimes almost in despair
i am sleepy i shall sleep
i am not going to confide in you so dont think it
i am going to get into bed and to remain perfectly quiet and you are not to ask me one question about anything
i mean that i dont want you to begin to ask questions
dont begin said annie
it has come she cried at last i have news
oh do turn off the electric light she said again
but your letter dear
i have to take german literature from fifteen hundred to the death of goethe said leslie
leslie stood and thought about her for a moment or two but then her own correspondence absorbed her and she did not notice when eleven and even twelve struck
i walked up and down as fast as ever i could outside in order to make myself sleepy
i have been starving or rather i have been thirsting
do you want to kill me
what do you mean replied leslie
you are ill said leslie
i took it out said leslie
you know on occasions you are absent minded and one half of this room is mine when alls said and done
refuses to come she cried
oh my dear said jane if you begin to fret about the oddities of the college you will never know a moments peace
she refuses to come
please dont call me that said leslie tears now visiting her pretty eyes
she turned back ran down the corridor and knocked at annies door
after the address the girls themselves were encouraged to speak and a very animated discussion followed
i will talk with you belle acheson presently she said
all her words were uttered with great eloquence and much feeling
i dont want she added to get into any set but i do wish to be kind to belle for i think she has good points in her
but marjorie and eileen had already departed and leslie and jane found themselves among the last students to arrive at the great east hall
she was a musician of rare power and leslie listened with her heart in her eyes
how dare you interfere she said her eyes flashing
she does not know what she is saying
oh i shall never do that replied leslie
excuses make no difference
she has committed a very grave act of disobedience
i dont think she is quite well replied leslie
they say too that you are exceedingly clever and yet you have no jealousies and no smallnesses in you
jane stooped and applied her eye to the keyhole but she could see nothing within
please find it before you go
it was past ten oclock when she left the hall
miss lauderdale said a great deal more
miss lauderdale will be very angry with anyone who does not attend
oh i wont lock you out she said but i must have the key
marjorie and eileen were close to her
jane came up
leslie walked to her own side of the room
am i my brothers keeper you ask she continued
and why may i ask
let me in
finally the principal sat down amid loud cheering
dont say any more cried jane
in despair she came back and joined leslie
have the goodness to find it and put it back
jane heriots voice was heard in the passage
but there you are one of the unco good i am afraid
she seems to have turned both deaf and dumb and i can do nothing with her she answered
ill wait for you here said leslie
most of the girls were enthusiastic over the new scheme and marjorie and eileen in particular felt their hearts glowing and their eyes sparkling
i know you dont quite mean what you say said leslie but of course if you really wish me
i am longing for you to leave the room
what is it leslie she said you look as if something was worrying you
yes you annoy me more than words can tell
if you two are ready she called out we may as well start
i pay for it and i have a right to it
i want to be alonego
for all who sin all who suffer you are to a certain extent responsible
what can this mean she said to herself
you are to go and say nothing about me
the physical part of your training and also the mental part are abundantly supplied in this great house of learning she continued but the spiritual part it seems to me ought now to be strengthened
she works too hard and she but there i dont know that i ought to say any more
something is replied leslie but i dont know that i ought to tell tales out of school
still there was no response
you fret me beyond endurance
here they were supplied with light refreshments and presently miss lauderdale herself went to the organ at the end of the room and played some splendid music
took it out
i believe poor annie is dreadfully unhappy
one by one the many students filed in and took their places
you are responsible for him and some day you will be asked what you have done with your responsibility if you leave the world without having fulfilled that terrible and yet grand obligation you will through all eternity feel the loss of what you might have gained
god answers to each of you you are the world says no i am not but god says yes you are all men are your brothers
i will then more fully declare my plans and show the girls who wish to join our league a programme which i hope they will approve of
there was no reply
miss lauderdale after a pause during which her kind eyes were fixed on belles excited face spoke
then a roll call was gone through by one of the tutors the only absentee was annie colchester
dodo let me
the girl who breaks the rules has to be punished
do let me go and tell miss frere
but now leslie what is the trouble
that is if you care to confide in me
i am sure she is ill
when it was over folding doors were thrown back and all the students were invited into the large saloon which miss lauderdale reserved for very rare and special occasions
i see by your face miss gilroy that you are distressed about something
some day jane you must see her
hear hear and once again hear suddenly said the sharp voice of belle acheson
oh annie i know you are dreadfully unhappy about something and i wish i could comfort you
jane stood still and faced leslie
i shall be only too delighted cried jane
she uttered her strange remark standing up
coming in a moment jane answered leslie
miss lauderdale stepped forward and began to address the students
say nothing about me please
since you came i feel myself tied and bound
i am afraid i am replied leslie distress now in her tone
i am jane heriot i want to speak to you at once
i ought not to leave you
it is just possible that she may have gone down the back stairs and be already in the hall
you will get into a most awful scrape if you dont
i must see her myself early in the morning and i am quite sure that nothing will satisfy miss lauderdale except a very ample apology and a full explanation of the reason why she absented herself
i felt her hand too and it was very hot
do come annie dont be such a goose
you see all the girls except eileen and marjorie laugh at her and that seems to me to make her worse
ill go back and speak to her
jane rattled the handle impatiently
you are a universal favorite i envy you your popularity
it is my duty to save her from getting into hopeless disgrace
that night she was marvellously beautiful
it is curious one must admit
i will have them taken off
good evening she said as i entered holding out her hand
but to be really loved by a courtesan that is a victory of infinitely greater difficulty
with them the body has worn out the soul the senses have burned up the heart dissipation has blunted the feelings
now go i cant keep my eyes open
as i saw him a cold shiver went through my heart
well keep it but it only depends on me to make it useless to you after all
they love by profession and not by instinct
at seven oclock i was at the vaudeville
how
i shall say nothing
how why
yes but if i should already ask for something
to be loved by a pure young girl to be the first to reveal to her the strange mystery of love is indeed a great happiness but it is the simplest thing in the world
how could i disobey
the duke comes every morning they will tell him when he comes that i am asleep and perhaps he will wait until i wake
do you understand
people blame those who let themselves be ruined by actresses and kept women what astonishes me is that twenty times greater follies are not committed for them
i know and you are wrong so let us say no more about it
there are bolts on the door
but to return to the first day of my liaison
i was wrong forgive me
doubtless marguerite perceived the impression made on me by the presence of this man for she smiled to me again and turning her back to the count appeared to be very attentive to the play
weeks months years pass and all at once when they have each followed their fate along a different path the logic of chance brings them face to face
after all the presence of m de g in marguerites box was the most natural thing in the world
hence those great devotions those austere retreats from the world of which some of them have given an example
when i reached home i was in a state of mad gaiety
yes my children said she have no fear
i returned to my seat
what
let me have that key
all day long
the boxes filled one after another
chapter twelve
only one remained empty the stage box
unfortunately he got it for me without my asking him and he asked me to go with him you know well enough that i couldnt refuse
he does not know the woman and she has pleasures griefs loves in which he has no part
well and good and now go back nicely to your place and above all no more jealousy
you know that i shouldnt be able to sleep there
then when god allows love to a courtesan that love which at first seems like a pardon becomes for her almost without penitence
i make these reflections to day
do you know that i am really afraid that i shall get very fond of you ask prudence
now that all is irrevocably ended they a rise naturally out of what has taken place
what is the matter with you to night said marguerite rising and coming to the back of the box and kissing me on the forehead
either marguerite was very clever in deception or she had conceived for me one of those sudden passions which are revealed in the first kiss and which die often enough as suddenly as they were born
she kissed me again and i left the box
well do it for me for i swear to you that i dont love you as the others have loved you
never had i gone to a theatre so early
you love then a little
i did not make these reflections on the morning when i returned home they could but have been the presentiment of what was to happen to me and despite my love for marguerite i did not foresee such consequences
but when the man who inspires this redeeming love is great enough in soul to receive it without remembering the past when he gives himself up to it when in short he loves as he is loved this man drains at one draught all earthly emotions and after such a love his heart will be closed to every other
good evening i replied to both marguerite and prudence
where
yes it is
one day a young man is passing in the street he brushes against a woman looks at her turns goes on his way
yes
wretch
as for me i no longer remembered how i had lived before that night my whole being was exalted into joy at the memory of the words we had exchanged during that first night
yes i sent him to fetch some sweets so that we could talk by ourselves for a moment
listen she said take the little gilt key on the mantelpiece open that door bring me back the key and go
sit down
the count will be coming back and there is nothing to be gained by his finding you here
see how young girls are watched and guarded
here are my orders to night at the vaudeville
the woman becomes the mans mistress and loves him
it is not for that reason
can you ask
at home
was i the cause of this coquetry
their two existences are henceforth one they have scarcely begun to know one another when it seems as if they had known one another always and all that had gone before is wiped out from the memory of the two lovers
you should go to bed she replied with that ironical air which went so well with her delicate and witty face
how strong he feels with his cruel right to say you do no more for love than you have done for money they know not what proof to give
because you dont like seeing him
she came to the front at once looked around the stalls saw me and thanked me with a look
now you must go back to your seat
your question becomes unnecessary and my answer useless
prudence was standing looking around the place marguerite seated on the sofa was meditating
precisely
and why could you not let me come up
why did you bring prudence i asked her
how can my visit change your plans
you do not accept the position you reject it as unworthy of you you are an ordinary lover do like the others pay me and say no more about it
he wants you to forgive him
here it is
never do they give you advice which is not lucrative
look here prudence do you know what he wants said marguerite
your letter undeceived me it showed me that you lacked the intelligence of the heart it did you more harm with me than anything you could possibly have done
may we see the bedroom
well i loved you all at once as much as my dog
pardon pardon i murmured
one has to but he wants more than that
their friendship is carried to the point of servility never to that of disinterestedness
then they become our friends or rather our guests at table
because she was at the theatre with me and because when i leave here i want to have some one to see me home
this is the third time that i have forgiven you
could not i do
go i said asking myself who it could be at such an hour and not daring to believe that it was marguerite
you in the way marguerite
and you do
and do you consent
because when you saw me spitting blood you took my hand because you wept because you are the only human being who has ever pitied me
yes sir
marguerite drew the letter from her bosom and handing it to me with a smile of infinite sweetness said
it is true that for twelve years of her life she used to beat me
when he died i cried more than when my mother died
by the way she added turning to me nanine will be gone to bed
my dear prudence i answered you do not know what you are saying
for these people we have to be merry when they are merry well when they want to sup sceptics like themselves
then i met you young ardent happy and i tried to make you the man i had longed for in my noisy solitude
at this moment prudence reappeared
thereupon joseph entered
it was hardly an hour after joseph and i had begun preparing for my departure when there was a violent ring at the door
i was looking forward to seeing you at twelve to having lunch with you and wiping out by seeing you a thought which was with me incessantly and which before i knew you i had no difficulty in tolerating
you must open the door take my key and try not to lose it again
i listened and i gazed at marguerite with admiration
we are sometimes obliged to buy the satisfaction of our souls at the expense of our bodies and we suffer still more when afterward that satisfaction is denied us
honestly do you care for me a little
your letter gave me a great deal of pain
i think that you are two children who havent an atom of sense between you but i also think that i am very hungry and that the sooner you consent the sooner we shall have supper
i have not come to hinder you from leaving paris
it was jealousy certainly but ironical and impertinent jealousy
what do you think
sir said joseph coming back to me it is two ladies
all of it
a great deal
then why did you deceive me
i embraced marguerite until she was almost stifled
but how
he wants to have supper with us
yes
what then
we are not allowed to have hearts under penalty of being hooted down and of ruining our credit
what a nice place youve got prudence went on
come said marguerite there is room for the three of us in my carriage
i have come because i had no time to answer you during the day and i did not wish to let you think that i was angry with you prudence didnt want me to come she said that i might be in the way
forget the rest and remember only one thing that we belong to one another that we are young and that we love
i came out of my room
if there were any other i would tell you for we are not to have any secrets from one another now
she kissed me on the forehead and said
naturally we have no friends
yes but besides not wishing to put you out i was sure that if you came as far as my door you would want to come up and as i could not let you i did not wish to let you go away blaming me for saying no
during this remark marguerite looked at me attentively
we are no longer beings but things we stand first in their self esteem last in their esteem
our hearts have their caprices it is their one distraction and their one excuse
i was already feeling sad when i received your letter
we no longer belong to ourselves
is that really the only reason
it is we armand cried a voice that i recognised as that of prudence
i tore the letter into fragments and kissed with tears the hand that gave it to me
certnly brer possum
certnly replied ol mistah buzzard
please mr buzzard please tell us the story he begged
oh my no
it was a very interesting story and it had been listened to with the closest attention by a lot of the little meadow and forest people
everybody laughed for everybody knows that no one asks more questions than peter rabbit
why i thought it was warm down south interrupted peter rabbit
everybody looked at peter and laughed
of course that make a terrible mess an a powerful lot of smoke an hot ashes fly up the chimney
twelve
he was curious about that black headed cousin of ol mistah buzzard very curious indeed
this sounded like another story
peter laughed with the rest although he looked a wee bit foolish
you know he hasnt a feather on it and it is very very red
but he dont mind that
she so scared she tip over a whole kettleful of soup right in the fire
but no one said anything and after a minute or two ol mistah buzzard explained
they like to choke that no count buzzard to death
that was a splendid story mr buzzard said he and im ever and ever so much obliged to you
peter rabbit pricked up his ears
peter made a funny face and laughed too
everybody looked surprised
why there is a black head in the buzzard family
a little sigh of satisfaction went around the circle of listeners
mah famly name is vulture said he
besides he rather enjoys telling stories
as usual peter rabbit was the first to speak
if you please how does your cousin happen to have a black head asked peter as politely as he knew how
because his grandpap asked too many questions replied ol mistah buzzard slyly winking at the others
you see no one ever had heard him called anything but buzzard
now ol mistah buzzard is naturally goodnatured and accommodating and when peter begged so hard he just couldnt find it in his heart to refuse
so it is brer rabbit
ol mistah buzzard had just told the story of why he has a bald head and is proud of it
dont ask me any questions miss innes
out of deference to liddy they washed their dishes once a day and they concocted queer messes according to their several abilities
his recovery was destined to be almost as sudden as his disappearance and was due directly to the tramp alex had brought to sunnyside
the doctor was puffing somewhat when we finally came to a halt
they had one triumph that they ate regularly for breakfast and that clung to their clothes and their hair the rest of the day
its no place for a woman i heard him protesting angrily
in spite of myself i drew my breath in sharply
something is going to occur he said
he carried something over his shoulder which i could not make out
between them i caught a glimpse of starlight shining down on rows of white headstones and an occasional more imposing monument or towering shaft
but if anything is going to occur dont dare to let me miss it
now miss innes he said gently
thus there is a sense of desecration of a reversal of the everlasting fitness of things in resurrecting a body from its mother clay
in this way we walked for perhaps twenty minutes
i asked no questions
i never expected to come to this he said once
there was a period of stress i think while the heavy coffin was being raised
i have none i said happily
they were talking confidentially together but when i came down they ceased
it was bacon hardtack and onions fried together
miss innes he said stopping me as i was about to go to my room up stairs how are your nerves tonight
mr jamieson called the hospital while we crowded around him
once indeedbut mr jamieson said it was an owl and i tried to believe him
theres one thing sureill not be suspected of complicity
we were on the edge of the casanova churchyard
the most unusual thing i can think of would be a peaceful night
i mean he persisted do you feel as though you could go through with something rather unusual
hang it
in patient endurance of evil she forgets it is our duty to admonish our neighbours of their transgressions
mr and mrs hattersley have been staying at the grove a fortnight and as mr hargrave is still absent and the weather was remarkably fine i never passed a day without seeing my two friends milicent and esther either there or here
but should you wish yourself to be like him
wheres milicent
could it be to dash away a tear
oh no i couldnt stand that
you cant continue as bad as you are without getting worse and more brutalised every day and therefore more like him
fire and fury
think of what she was five years ago when you married her and what she is now
shes there just coming in with her sister
its her own delicate health and confound it madam what would you make of meand the children to be sure that worry her to death between them
what do you think of that
nay not i said he turning her round and pushing her towards me thank her its her doing
chapter forty two
september firstno mr huntingdon yet
perhaps he will stay among his friends till christmas and then next spring he will be off again
no
not years for shes only five and twenty
i could not help smiling at the comical half angry half confounded look he put on at this rather unusual mode of address
you never tried me milly said he
god help me thenfor im sure i need it
shortly after they took their leave
since you will mistake her silence for indifference come with me and ill show you one or two of her lettersno breach of confidence i hope since you are her other half
i followed at a little distance
how very very good you are
well im not thirty yet it isnt too late is it
well i think youre better without him sure enoughfor my part im downright weary of him
then why lay the blame on themill tell you what it is its silent fretting and constant anxiety on your account mingled i suspect with something of bodily fear on her own
i know they arebless them
never mind my plain speaking said i it is from the best of motives but tell me should you wish your sons to be like mr huntingdonor even like yourself
no
of course not and i dont and im not going to
what is the cause of it then
if you intend to reform invoke gods blessing his mercy and his aid not his curse
but hang itthats not my fault
its well these women must be blabbing
mr huntingdon then went up stairs
unluckily for me he was more sober that night than he usually is at such an hour
he then rang the bell
benson your mistress has broken the candle bring another
and so said he at length you thought to disgrace me did you by running away and turning artist and supporting yourself by the labour of your hands forsooth
and as i departed he went on cursing and abusing my faithful friend and servant with epithets i will not defile this paper with repeating
i am a slavea prisonerbut that is nothing if it were myself alone i would not complain but i am forbidden to rescue my son from ruin and what was once my only consolation is become the crowning source of my despair
what great discovery have you made now mr huntingdon
i try to look to him and raise my heart to heaven but it will cleave to the dust
i didnt say id broken it did i returned he
chapter forty
and i know too said he suddenly seizing my closed hand and rudely abstracting them from it
not in money matters exactly it seems but its best to keep out of the way of temptation
what keys
and putting the keys into his pocket he walked into the library
and you thought to rob me of my son too and bring him up to be a dirty yankee tradesman or a low beggarly painter
he then took up one of the candles and relighted it by thrusting it into the fire
now then sneered he we must have a confiscation of property
who told you this said she
and now lady lowborough continued i let me counsel you to leave this house as soon as possible
but god have mercy on his miserable soul and make him see and feel his guilti ask no other vengeance
but i cannot go helen before the time appointed for our departure
i sometimes think i ought to give him credit for the good feeling he simulates so well and then again i think it is my duty to suspect him under the peculiar circumstances in which i am placed
i have done well to record them so minutely
give me no thanks it is not for your sake that i refrain
you use hard words mrs huntingdon but i can pardon you
yes yes of course said she interrupting me with a gesture of impatience
her impudence astounded me but i complied and followed her into the library
the word stares me in the face like a guilty confession but it is true i hate himi hate him
suppose i do
no one i am not incapable of seeing for myself
yet why so long for their departure
annabella will excuse us said she shes busy reading
i shall not tell him
eveningbreakfast passed well over i was calm and cool throughout
if i were suspicious i replied i should have discovered your infamy long before
i am too well acquainted with your character and conduct to feel any real friendship for you and as i am without your talent for dissimulation i cannot assume the appearance of it
she coloured again excessively and remained silent pressing her finger against her teeth and gazing into the fire
i would not for much that she should know the infamy and disgrace of her relation
no lady lowborough i do not found my charge upon suspicion
some of us at least
then she took a fancy into her head that she ought to accept this piece of good fortune for the sake of the family and forget herself
how happy they seem oh dear said polly and trudged on wondering if her turn would ever come and fearing that it was impossible
it s always so refreshing to me to see a little bit of the country as it were especially at this season
yes it s the pleasantest walk we have dont you think so asked the artful young man laying a trap into which polly immediately fell
there was a dreadful little pause which polly broke by saying abruptly how is fan
polly did nt say that quite naturally and sydney gave her a quick look as he asked do you get tired of old friends too miss polly
i wish the other trouble could be cured as easily as this
what would your blessed mother say to hear such expressions from you
who is here katy
willy likes flossy best so stop crying and come right along you naughty child
minnie happened to be poorly that week and took no lesson so uncle syd was deprived of his last hope and looked as if his allowance of sunshine had been suddenly cut off
but with fanny and polly he showed the domestic traits and virtues which are more engaging to womanly women than any amount of cool intellect or worldly wisdom
at a street corner a black eyed school boy was parting from a rosy faced school girl whose music roll he was reluctantly surrendering
you seem to find it so and polly laughed with a sudden sparkle in her eyes
do you go as usual
he understood and being a gentleman made no fuss
the more proposals the more credit
it dont do to think of her and i wont said polly to herself setting her lips with a grim look that was not at all becoming
i wont think of myself or try to mend one mistake by making another she said with a heavy sigh
but pollys education had been neglected and after a good deal of natural indecision she did what most women do in such cases thought she would wait and see
ah you never see her at her best
minnie said the other day she wished she was a pigeon so she could paddle in the puddles and not fuss about rubbers
i just gave him a hint and he took it
yes
i know it s considered proper for girls to shut their eyes and let things come to a crisis no matter how much mischief is done
i wonder why such a love of conquest was put into us mother says a great deal of it is owing to bad education nowadays but some girls seem born for the express purpose of making trouble and would manage to do it if they lived in a howling wilderness
she did not mean to tell but his frankness was so agreeable she forgot herself
no
have you given up teaching the roths asked sydney changing the subject
dashing as ever
she really could nt help it it was so pleasant to see him again just when she was feeling so lonely
what wicked creatures we are
i never had much faith in the remarkable coincidence of his always happening home to dinner just as i go to give the roths their lesson
this had an especial charm to polly for she soon found that this side of his character was not shown to every one
truly
on the evening of fans visit polly sat down before her fire with a resolute and thoughtful aspect
as poor little dido was jerked away by the unsympathetic maid and purple gaiters essayed in vain to plead his cause polly said to herself with a smile and a sigh how early the old story begins
yes indeed
i could do so much for all at home how i should enjoy that and polly let her thoughts revel in the luxurious future her fancy painted
i know it but people sometimes get tired of old ways and like to try new ones
oh but i dont
yes
dont you think he means to
no
what have you been doing with yourself lately asked fanny composing herself with her back toward the rapidly waning light
i do think fan would suit him excellently by and by
take hold of master charleys hand miss mamie and walk pretty like willy and flossy said the maid
he was gone before she could do anything but look up at him with a remorseful face and she walked on feeling that the first and perhaps the only lover she would ever have had read his answer and accepted it in silence
not often but
let me see how can i begin
who got up that nice idea i should like to know demanded polly as fanny stopped for breath
wont you stop a bit miss polly
polly sydney dont sound well and mrs arthur sydney dont seem to fit me a bit
oh me
nothing particular
dont you think he cared for you dear asked fanny presently
only mr sydney and master tom
they all think a great deal of him because he is so hard to please and almost any of them would feel immensely flattered if he liked them whether they chose to marry him or not
polly i m ashamed of you
how lovely the park looks she said in great confusion
trix treats tom shamefully and he bears it like a lamb
i dont think it was his wealth accomplishments or position that most attracted polly though these doubtless possessed a greater influence than she suspected
i saw you from the shaws window and took the liberty of running after you by the back street he said laughing
oh polly polly what a stupid speech to make when you had just given him to understand that you were tired of the park
this finished pollys indecision and after that night she never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant temptation which came in a guise particularly attractive to a young girl with a spice of the old eve in her composition
truly fan
chapter fourteen
what an easy life i should have plenty of money quantities of friends all sorts of pleasures and no work no poverty no cold shoulders or patched boots
there was no answer to her question but she was satisfied and putting her arm round her friend she said in her most persuasive tone my precious polly do i know him
dont he love back again
oh polly i am so glad
two great tears rolled down pollys cheeks and fanny wiped them away feeling an intense desire to go west by the next train wither maria bailey with a single look and bring tom back as a gift to polly
then i shall wait and pollys face changed so beautifully that fan hugged her on the spot fervently wishing that maria bailey never had been born
you dont look a bit natural
i m willing but you must let me see the letter
once or twice but sort of jokingly and i thought it was only some little flirtation
and is he very wise good and splendid dear
tell me truly have you never repented of your hint to sydney
could nt help it tried not to but it was so hard you know fan you know said a stifled voice from the depths of the very fuzzy cushion which tom had once condemned
prepare yourself somebody is engaged she said in a solemn tone that made polly put up her hand as if to ward off an expected blow
it does look bad
i wont but now i m not afraid to tell you that i think i hope i do believe that sydney cares a little for me
i m proper glad to find you looking so well and happy
you have seen him
tom wrote once a week to his mother but the letters were short and not very satisfactory for men never do tell the interesting little things that women best like to hear
what do you say ned answered when you asked about this inconvenient girl said fanny turning hopeful all at once
i try not to deceive myself but it does seem as if there was a chance of happiness for me
too late let me tell you is that door shut and maud safe
the silence never lasts long however for the feminine desire to talk it over usually gets the better of the deepest emotion
no
fanny forwarded her bits of news to polly
no
really my sister
dont be so fierce polly you quite frighten me
since then he has nt mentioned maria so i was sure there was something serious going on and being in toms confidence he kept quiet
s was a domestic man and admired housewifely accomplishments
what do you mean
fanny reconnoitered and returning listened breathlessly while polly poured into her ear the bitter secret which was preying on her soul
thank heaven for that cried polly with the heartiest satisfaction in her voice
if it is true about maria what shall we do said fanny after a pause
he ought to be if you love him
on my honor as anything you please
fortunately every one was so busy with the necessary preparations that there was no time for romance of any sort and the four young people worked together as soberly and sensibly as if all sorts of emotions were not bottled up in their respective hearts
but you see tom always seems so like a boy and you are more womanly for your age than any girl i know so i never thought of your caring for him in that way
on your honor as an honest girl
she never said much of herself in her letters and fannys first exclamation when they met again was an anxious why polly dear have you been sick and never told me
polly did not look sick though her cheeks were thinner and her color paler than formerly but she seemed spiritless and there was a tired look in her eyes that went to fannys heart
like i always said honesty sure pays even if it kills you
why dont you pull off the planet fats
yeah
thought youd be in the chips
bruce gordon nodded slowly
chapter seventeen
the man dropped to another stool rolling dice casually between his thumbs
its up to them to take it or lose it
damn it we sent you here to get results and you got them
were not throwing the book at you bruce
we know about murdoch and we know where trench isbut hes a good citizen now so he can stay there
the car pulled up to the waiting rocket and the security man helped him up the steps with a perfunctory wish for good luck
shes had bad luck with men
we cant know in our lifetime
it was almost good to get out into the filth of the slums and be heading back to the still standing monument of the old chicken coop
for the time being the hoods and punks were having a tough time of it with working papers demanded as constant identification
maybe you should have got me that night fats
out at the spaceport ships were dropping down from deimos with the supplies that had been held up so long and a long line of trucks went snaking by
gordon dropped to a stool slipping off his helmet
only gordon and sheila were left
this time it even tasted good to him
guess ill have to stick to selling meals mostlyfor a while at least
you cant stay here
and bring out a steak there
izzy shook his head
shes out shopping
hello gordon
thats mars gordon echoed the others comment
he headed for the private entrance out of habit and then shrugged as he realized it was a needless precaution now
he grabbed gordons hand and waddled down the landing plank
its mercury
gordon grinned wryly schulbergs volunteers were official now
then he stopped
guess a man gets used to anything
he muttered to himself as he headed over the rubble toward the previously domed section
you could go back to earth id guess
spent four weeks down there
you look as if you could stand itand fats dont forget old friends
all right
gordon sighed
there was a man coming from earth on a second ship who would see him
did you think wed let you go without seeing you off cobber he asked
the other shook his head
and ive paid her the pay we owe you from the time you began using your badge
so i get sent to mercury
he moved up the front steps and through the battered seal
youre a fighter
he reached automatically for the glass of ether needled beer
credit had been established again and the businesses were open
finally got our orders for you
i cant say it either govnorbut some day im going to have one of those badges myself
on the house copper fats voice said
the other nodded
they gave him a chauffeur back to the chicken coop and politely indicated that it would be better if he stayed within reach
shed asked no questions and hadnt even tried to convince him that hed be sent back to earth now
gordon moved automatically toward the seventh ward
wrecks were being broken up with salvageable material used for newer homes gordon came to a row of temporary bubbles individual dwellings built like the dome but opaque for privacy
izzy you tell him
gordon grinned wryly fats would probably make more than ever
all we can do is to hope
thats mars he rolled the dice out then picked them up again
it was three days before bruce gordon made up his mind to hunt up security another four days passed after they had sent him back to wait until they received orders from headquarters for him
he heard her coming down the old stairs and ducked out through the private exit snapping his helmet in place as he went through the seal she must have sensed his desire to be left alone since she made no attempt to follow
theyll find out too much eventually he paused estimating gordon
i wonder if its worth it gordon said slowly
well probably get this mother corey and isaacs elected properly and for a while things will improve
but i wish youd tell my wife sometime thatwell that i didnt just run out on her
he finished the meal accepted a pack of the earth cigarettes that sold at a luxury price here and went out into the thin air of mars
he grinned again
but his old eyes were glinting
here
and theres hell brewing on mercuryworse than here
with a yellow ticket againbut without any razzle dazzle this time
she already knows the security man said
the dome had exploded outwards with only bits of it falling back and the buildings had come through the outward explosion of the pressure with little damage
fats place was still open though the crooked tables had been removed
there was a grin on the others face
lets say youve shifted some of the misery around a bit and given them a chance to do better
hell maybe i can hire some bums to sit around and whoop it up when the ships come in and bill this as a real old martian den of sin
the dome had been down a full week when he watched the last of randolphs equipment packed onto a truck and hauled away
weve got permission to send you there if youll go
security had finally gotten around to him it seemed inside the hallway the security man whod first sent him to mars was waiting
security payoff
i went back about ten years ago
all right
the old charter for marsport from north america was dead and the whole city was now under security charter like the rest of the planet
then bruce gordon stopped as great arms surrounded him
they had been lucky
and while it lasted at least marsport was beginning to have its face lifted
but therell be pushers as long as weak men turn to drugs and graft as long as voters allow the thing to get out of their hands
we sent twenty others the same wayand they failed
rusty was busy opening his bar and the others were all busy
he found himself liking the other
the one good thing about the captain gordon decided was that he believed in doing his own dirtiest work
they rode on further in silence until gordon broke the ice to ease the tension
some of mars laws dated from the time when law enforcement had been hampered by lack of men rather than by the type of men
for a second gordon cursed himself
knock them out and kick them down murdoch yelled
ever see a martian election
he opened up a box on his desk and pulled out six heavy wooden sticks each thirty inches long and nearly two inches in diameter
the number of muggings and holdups in the section was going down
were covered gordon
bruce gordon was trapped he couldnt break his job with the policeif he did hed be brought back as a criminal
but you got earth ideas of the stuff like i had once
the week moved on
hes let me come in because he figures it will get him more votes
wed better shift to another territory murdoch decided
at the front of each building a dim phosphor bulb glowed when darkness fell they would have nothing else to see by
the groups grew more experienced and murdoch was training a new squad every night
after that the watchers began to melt away
too bad he sighed ponderously
take me cobber
the pressure was enough to get them for him
but its going to be tough on them
okay men lets go
murdoch bunched them together
there was a crude lighting system here put up by the citizens
and youll turn honest all over now youre in uniform
no graft
two more groups were given the treatment
he swallowed the sentiment his own club was moving now
he picked out five of the men including gordon you five will come with me
citizens were appearing on the streets at night for the first time in years
but marsport had flourished enough to kill it off
damn it youre men not sharks
his screams were almost worse than the beating but names began to come gordon took them down and then returned with the man to the others
no youre a firster
there was a shaped grip on each with a thong of leather to hold it over the wrist
the stonewall gang numbered perhaps five hundred
the hoodlums tossed the man aside easily and let out a yell
colonel theyd kill me i dont know
he squealed he announced
it fitted with the dire predictions of security and with the spying gordon was going to doaccording to them
and then hell is going to pop and this whole planet may be blown wide open
murdoch nodded
what makes you think wayne will be reelected
murdoch sent one of the men to pick up a second squad of six and then a third
but the stonewall gang is backing wayne
and police had been taken off the beats there after it grew unsafe even for men in pairs to patrol the area
the gang
your job is to protect the citizens hereand that means everyone not breaking the lawswhether you feel like it or not
youll get double pay here and you can live on it
a skilled man could knock a knife or even a heavy club out of anothers hand with a single flick of the wrist
ive got a yellow ticket from security
because izzy is always honest according to how he sees it
captain murdoch was an unknown factor and now was asking for more men
murdoch shrugged
line them up
the first man making a shakedown will get the same treatment were going to use on the stonewall boys
get a stretcher and take him wherever he belongs he ordered
nobody had tried to get in touch with him
the other four cops had come in reluctantly
ive got a free hand and were going to run this the way we would on earth
gordon found a section away from the others
besides itll show on the books that they didnt kick into his fund
bruce gordon grimaced
because every time one of my men sees one of you this will happen again
but whatever your reasons youll be useful
and hed had practice
a good clubbing beats hanging he told them
the gang had begun to break up but the nucleus would be the last to go the police had orders to beat any member on sight now
murdoch indicated one who stood with his shoulders shaking and tears running down his cheeks
he brought him to the ground with a single blow across the kidneys
i want the name of every man in the gang you can remember he told the man
to find a phone and call the wagon
gordon rode back in the official car with murdoch and both were silent most of the way
cost em more but theyd be respectable
they rounded up the men of the gang and one of the cops started off
and you can pass the word along that the stonewall gang is dead
the old book i got the idea from didnt mention that
gordons eyes popped at that
but this honesty stuff its like dope
chapter four
they were covering an area of six blocks one way and two the other
poor devils
the shopkeepers and some of the less unfortunate people there had protested loud enough to reach clear back to earth
murdoch had fixed it so hed be a squad leader and that meant hed be unable to step out of line
names
from the buildings around an assortment of toughs came at the double swinging knives picks and bludgeons
they had the names of nearly all of them and some pretty good ideas of their hide outs
murdoch called where are you going
at one time there had been a small dome and a tiny city devoted to the rocket field
then you should be ashamed to be in this mess
only now im respectable myself they dont look so good
nobody wants him except a gang of crooks and those in power
murdoch grinned bitterly
he saw murdochs club dart in and take out two of the gang one on the forward swing one on the recover
bruce gordon grinned slowly as he swung the stick and murdochs eyes fell on him
if a doctors job was to prevent illness instead of merely curing it then why shouldnt it be a policemans job to prevent crime
a thin screech like a whistle came from murdochs marspeaker and the captain went forward with gordon at his heels
im leaving you two able to walk for that
the man was totally unlike a martian captain and a knot of homesickness for earth ran through his stomach
he was a sick looking spectacle
nope
moving in two groups of threes at opposite sides of the street they began their beat
now get out of this district or get honest jobs
hell win mother corey repeated
but there was little grumbling
standing beside murdoch they were moving forward
you start out on a little and you have to go all the way
he discussed it with mother corey who agreed that wayne would be reelected
i can always go back to earth and ill try to take you along
murdoch blinked
it wasnt exactly legal but nothing was here
but afterwards hell have me out and then the boys with me will be marks for the gang when it comes back
if he should turn up dead ill know you boys are responsible and ill find you
cant lose the old man said
there was no chance to save the citizen who was dying from lack of air gordon felt the solid pleasure of the finely turned club in his hands it was light enough for speed but heavy enough to break bones where it hit
earth cop
he cant lose
gordon nodded
but the captain stirred finally sighing
youre going to be busy murdoch announced shortly in the dilapidated building that had been hastily converted to a precinct house
and dont let them get away
gordon saw grudging admiration in their eyes for murdoch who had taken more punishment than they had
go in for business and dont stop just because the other guy quits
when he was finished he turned to two of the other captives
this could lead to abuses as hed seen on earth
it didnt affect honest izzy gordon pointed out
after that they began to go hunting for the members of the gang
if they fought back the pugnaciousness was knocked out of them at once
gordons own squad was equipped with shields now and they were doing better
as the police swung around one of the thugs casually ripped the airsuit open
the squad went in tired and sore all had taken a severe beating in the brawls
take those two and give them some lessons while i do the same with these
murdoch took his nod as evidence enough and turned to the wretched toughs
object lesson
here that was best done by wiping out the stonewall gang to the last member
between times they picked up what they could by mugging and theft with a reasonable amount of murder thrown in at a modest price
when the hoods came to they found themselves helpless and facing police with clubs
captain murdoch
he began wondering about security then
it was soon over
gordon realized that the gang had figured that concentrating the police here meant other territories would be safe
suppose the whole gang jumps us at once
gordon reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out mixed with a vague relief
two of the stonewall boys were working over a tall man in a newer airsuit
two years gordon admitted
gordon jerked up in surprise
gordon nodded to a couple and they grinned faintly at him damn it mars could be cleaned up
so youre it
now he held it out toward gordon
gordon moved forward quickly until he could make out the thin scar showing through the makeup over the mans eyes
buy you a beer
when it was over the two picked up their whimpering captive
youre not assigned here any more
oneill had turned to run and then seemed to think better of it
with you out here and me busy nights doing a bit of convoy work on the side we might as well not both live at mothers
you cant do it to me
then another cop came around a corner at a run
jet me
thanks izzy
youre right govnor
use them
recall
guns suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere the gun dropped from oneills hand as the wrist snapped and the stonewall chief let out a high pitched cry of pain
i sure asked for that one
anyhow you wont miss it
fifty fifty
if any members of the gang were around they made no attempt to rescue him
the other cop had yanked out oneills wallet and now tossed it to gordon
the heavy locust stick met the mans wrist before the weapon was half drawnanother gun
you owe me some bills govnor eleven hundred fifty credits
so you paid it
theres no graft out here
then he stopped and looked back
right
his hand darted down to his belt just as gordon reached him
when gordon and jenkins came back murdoch tossed the money to them
he was suddenly in no mood to quibble with izzys personal code
your legs are still whole
long time no see
hi govnor the little man greeted him
like this social call gordon asked him
bruce gordon reached the outskirts of the miserable business section noticing that a couple of the shops were still open
gordon hit the signal switch and the marspeaker let out a shrill whistle
wrong izzy
none of us are
he grinned at himself then something needled at his mind until he swung back
i never saw it gordon youve got a visitor
and the slow doubtful respect on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that haleys system was working
if they want to collect that dratted pledge of theirs let them put me where i can make it
gordon shrugged and gave up
waiting for him was the lean cynical little figure of honest izzy complete with uniform and sergeants stripes
split it
hed been rightthis was oneill head of the stonewall gang
the cops had been passing them on the hope of finding one of the leaders
wearing their uniform makes me a temporary citizen
it had probably been years since any had dared risk it after the sun went down
he inspected the forged work papers and jerked his thumb toward one of the hastily built cells where a doctor would look oneill overeventually
turn it in to murdoch gordon said and then cursed himself
for a second izzys face went blank then he chuckled
you guys earned it by keeping your hands off it
ive been meaning to see you so i volunteered to run out some red tape for your captain
the captain looked completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped onto the bench
huh izzy turned it over and shook his head
its been a pleasure working with you sergeant gordon
okay im bloody well suckered so forget it
gordon had heard of the friendly interest charged on the side here but he shook his head
the little guy knew mars as few others did apparently from all sides
the little man shook his head his ancient eighteen year old face turning sober
im assigned here izzy at least for another week until after elections
it was night outside and the phosphor bulbs at the corners glowed dimly giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the extemporized precinct house
but he shook his head
gordon went down the passage to the end of the hall in the direction murdoch had indicated
the man staggered between them whimpering at each step
all right gordon admitted
the force pays for my time during the day and i figure my times my own at night
and if any of the other cops had private rackets of their own izzy was undoubtedly the man to find it out and use the information
gordon pocketed the revolver with his free hand walk oneill he ordered
the captains face had been buried in a pile of papers but now murdoch came around to stare at the gang leader
jenkins the other cop had been holding the wallet
you damned cops cant oneill was blubbering
a thousand interest at ten per cent a week standard
finally he shrugged dont matter govnor
i came out to tell you i got the sweetest beat in marsportover a dozen gambling joints on itand i need a right gee to work it with me
nope
there must have been over two thousand credits in the wallet
for a moment gordon wondered what izzy had done to earn that beat but he could guess
with a beat such as that even going halves and with all the graft to the upper brackets hed still be able to make his pile in a matter of months
of course if i ever catch myself doing anything shady during the day ill have to turn myself in but it aint likely he grinned in satisfaction
some turned away as gordon and the other cop went to work but most of them werent squeamish
go on accept damn it
i thought i had full responsibility to earth but hes got me
thanks yourself the kid pocketed the money cheerfully nodding
he pulled out the bills and handed them over
one thing though ive still got enough authority to make you a sergeant
bruce gordon nodded grinning in spite of himself
convoy duty izzy or dope running
whatever comes to hand govnor
nothing about that in the pledge and when you sign something you gotta pay it
im reformed im going straight
his voice was bitter but he made no opening for them to question him as he picked up the papers and began going through them again
it was kinder thin ice but i says
lize hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away or did you get your breakfast on the boat
but it didnt save him
i cant imagine says the old gentleman and i must say it makes me dreadful uneasy
sally its terrible just terrible somethings happened to the boat sure
yes it was mortification that was it
so i says to myself heres another place where i got to resk the truth i opened my mouth to begin but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed and says
you must a met him on the road didnt you oldish man with a
i see id got to invent a bar or forget the name of the one we got aground on or now i struck an idea and fetched it out
no says her husband
but i couldnt get no show mrs phelps kept it up and run on so
howd you get your breakfast so early on the boat
that didnt help me much though for i didnt know the names of bars down that way
i must go up the road and waylay him
dont you let on youre here
he was a baptist
there aint no harm in a hound nohow
but i go a good deal on instinct and my instinct said she would be coming up from down towards orleans
when we got there she set me down in a split bottomed chair and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me holding both of my hands and says
the old gentleman stared and says
i went right along not fixing up any particular plan but just trusting to providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come for id noticed that providence always did put the right words in my mouth if i left it alone
i haint no idea
but if they was joyful it warnt nothing to what i was for it was like being born again i was so glad to find out who i was
they say he was a sight to look at
so i told the folks i reckoned i would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage
i said i had got it on the boat
i had my mind on the children all the time i wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little and find out who i was
but they ducked their heads and put their fingers in their mouths and hid behind her
dont say yesm say aunt sally
we been expecting you a couple of days and more
i see i was in a fix now
being tom sawyer was easy and comfortable and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by i hear a steamboat coughing along down the river
whered she get aground
well i see i was up a stump and up it good
mortification set in and they had to amputate him
he sprung to the window at the head of the bed and that give mrs phelps the chance she wanted
your uncle silas knowed a family in baton rouge that knowed his people very well
it warnt the grounding that didnt keep us back but a little
phelps was one of these little one horse cotton plantations and they all look alike
no i didnt see nobody aunt sally
he
she grabbed me and hugged me tight and then gripped me by both hands and shook and shook and the tears come in her eyes and run down over and she couldnt seem to hug and shake enough and kept saying you dont look as much like your mother as i reckoned you would but law sakes i dont care for that im so glad to see you
we blowed out a cylinder head
has he come
if id a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well
when i got halfway first one hound and then another got up and went for me and of course i stopped and faced them and kept still
and such another powwow as they made
so then she started for the house leading me by the hand and the children tagging after
yesm she
and hes gone again not moren an hour ago hell be back any minute now
nom killed a nigger
why whos that
he turned blue all over and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection
i didnt rightly know what to say because i didnt know whether the boat would be coming up the river or down
and behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger boys without anything on but tow linen shirts and they hung on to their mothers gown and peeped out from behind her at me bashful the way they always do
and spose he steps in here any minute and sings out my name before i can throw him a wink to keep quiet
good gracious anybody hurt
then i says to myself spose tom sawyer comes down on that boat
look yonder up the road aint that somebody coming
i was getting so uneasy i couldnt listen good
she was smiling all over so she could hardly stand and says
i see it warnt a bit of use to try to go ahead id got to throw up my hand
she stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and give me a pull and out i come and when he turned back from the window there she stood a beaming and a smiling like a house afire and i standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside
and i think he died afterwards
but there warnt no time to swap knives the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook and kept on shaking and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry and then how they both did fire off questions about sid and mary and the rest of the tribe
mrs phelps she jumps for him and says
ill play a joke on him children dont you say a word
not where i hid it i reckon it wont i says
now i was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side and pretty uncomfortable all up the other
you must a missed him
by jings i most slumped through the floor
well its lucky because sometimes people do get hurt
your uncles been up to the town every day to fetch you
why silas
uneasy she says im ready to go distracted
oh dont distress me any moren im already distressed
so she run on
nobody
children its your cousin tom tell him howdy
all i say is kings is kings and you got to make allowances
i didnt take notice nor let on
they fetch her up next morning chop off her head and they chop it off
ring up fair rosamun fair rosamun answers the bell
i went to sleep and jim didnt call me when it was my turn
this ones a middling hard lot for a duke
just a word gentlemen they stopped to listen
house was jammed again that night and we sold this crowd the same way
well howd the old thing pan out this time duke he hadnt been up town at all
and look at charles second and louis fourteen and louis fifteen and james second and edward second and richard third and forty more besides all them saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise cain
dont it sprise you de way dem kings carries on huck
spose he opened his mouth what then
the duke says yes
greenhorns flatheads
its the way theyre raised
i reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience but nothing of the sort pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam and says
we are sold mighty badly sold
aint that sensible you bet it is the jedge is right everybody sings out all right then not a word about any sell
go along home and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy
and but never mind the rest of his outfit it was just wild but it was awful funny
no drownded him in a butt of mamsey like a cat
its the way i feel too jim
next day you couldnt hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show was
but not very different
fetch up jane shore he says and up she comes next morning chop off her head and they chop it off
how does he go at it give notice give the country a show
when i waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees moaning and mourning to himself
ask him to show up
he used to marry a new wife every day and chop off her head next morning
chapter twenty three
when hes drunk there aint no near sighted man could tell him from a king
we never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village then we lit up and had a supper and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way theyd served them people
i knowed what it was about
well when the place couldnt hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute and then he started around for the stage door i after him but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says
well thats what im a saying all kings is mostly rapscallions as fur as i can make out
my you ought to seen old henry the eight when he was in bloom
we struck the raft at the same time and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream all dark and still and edging towards the middle of the river nobody saying a word
what is it over
well what did he do
he always done the other thing
he often done that
but a big fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts
well henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country
i says
and he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs
then there was a fine time
well it dont because its in the breed
spose people left money laying around where he was what did he do
i stood by the duke at the door and i see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging or something muffled up under his coat and i see it warnt no perfumery neither not by a long sight
what was the use to tell jim these warnt real kings and dukes
you read about them once youll see
then well all be in the same boat
fetch up nell gwynn he says
twenty people sings out
hold on
the duke says
well all day him and the king was hard at it rigging up a stage and a curtain and a row of candles for footlights and that night the house was jam full of men in no time
sometimes i wish we could hear of a country thats out of kings
i done it and he done the same
i was a bilin
them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty five dollars in that three nights
well they all do jim
walk fast now till you get away from the houses and then shin for the raft like the dickens was after you
but weve got them on our hands and we got to remember what they are and make allowances
yes a dukes different
if he didnt shut it up powerful quick hed lose a lie every time
the people most killed themselves laughing and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes they roared and clapped and stormed and haw hawed till he come back and done it over again and after that they made him do it another time
and then there he was slim and handsome and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum and finally skipped off and made his bow and danced off to the dressing room and everybody just a howling with pleasure and astonishment
he shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air and altogether he shed seventeen suits
i could a stayed if i wanted to but i didnt want to
chapter twenty two
the bills said
the racket stopped and the wave sucked back
then he says slow and scornful
tear down the fence then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing and down she goes and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave
well all through the circus they done the most astonishing things and all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people
its amusing
and they laughed all the time and that made the duke mad and everybody left anyway before the show was over but one boy which was asleep
i went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by and then dived in under the tent
it was a real bully circus
why dont your juries hang murderers
so the duke said these arkansaw lunkheads couldnt come up to shakespeare what they wanted was low comedy and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy he reckoned
your mistake is that you didnt bring a man with you thats one mistake and the other is that you didnt come in the dark and fetch your masks
sherburn never said a word just stood there looking down
some sung out tear down the fence
the pitifulest thing out is a mob thats what an army is a mob they dont fight with courage thats born in them but with courage thats borrowed from their mass and from their officers
he had got up that joke all out of his own head and never let on to nobody
the crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearing off every which way and buck harkness he heeled it after them looking tolerable cheap
so next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint and drawed off some handbills and stuck them up all over the village
it was a little twenty foot yard
why it was one of his own men
and so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring and made the sweetest bow i ever see and then scampered out and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild
sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out gaze him but they couldnt they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky
the stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable
the average man dont like trouble and danger
just then sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch with a double barrel gun in his hand and takes his stand perfectly cam and deliberate not saying a word
he said he could size their style
do i know you
it warnt funny to me though i was all of a tremble to see his danger but pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle a reeling this way and that and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood and the horse a going like a house afire too
they swarmed up towards sherburns house a whooping and raging like injuns and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush and it was awful to see
i dont know there may be bullier circuses than what that one was but i never struck them yet
you cant be too careful
i know you clear through
they swarmed up in front of sherburns palings as thick as they could jam together and you couldnt hear yourself think for the noise
you didnt want to come
i never knowed how clothes could change a body before
what did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for
and tell him to git himself up regardless
did anybody send em word
git aboard says the king
too bad too bad he couldnt a lived to see his brothers poor soul you going to orleans you say
the young fellow says
its a pretty long journey
well the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied that young fellow
jim he spoke to the duke and said he hoped it wouldnt take but a few hours because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope
he said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day and trembling all over every time there was a sound
then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so
about the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along but they didnt come from high enough up the river but at last there was a big one and they hailed her
when theyre deep they wont stop for a hail
then he says
harvey and williams the only ones thats left now and as i was saying they havent got here in time
for the steamboat going to orleans
i done so and then we all three started on again
the king never said nothing about going aboard so i lost my ride after all
shove along now
i done it
sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash and fell up against the man and put his chin on his shoulder and cried down his back and says
funeral to morrow likely
then he says
these rapscallions wanted to try the nonesuch again because there was so much money in it but they judged it wouldnt be safe because maybe the news might a worked along down by this time
the duke told him to make himself free and easy and if anybody ever come meddling around he must hop out of the wigwam and carry on a little and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone which was sound enough judgment but you take the average man and he wouldnt wait for him to howl
but itll be lovely wisht i was a going is mary jane the oldest
next day towards night we laid up under a little willow towhead out in the middle where there was a village on each side of the river and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns
if they warnt the beatenest lot them two frauds that ever i struck
yes sir its the best way
and that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to
well its all terrible sad but weve all got to go one time or another
when the boat was gone the king made me paddle up another mile to a lonesome place and then he got ashore and says
jim was satisfied
now hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the new carpet bags
then he turns around blubbering and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the duke on his hands and blamed if he didnt drop a carpet bag and bust out a crying
blamed if he didnt inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town and all about the wilkses and about peters business which was a tanner and about georges which was a carpenter and about harveys which was a dissentering minister and so on and so on
oh yes pretty well off
mary janes nineteen susans fifteen and joannas about fourteen thats the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare lip
was peter wilks well off
run her nose in shore says the king
so then they waited for a steamboat
how are you on the deef and dumb bilgewater
a cincinnati boat will but this is a saint louis one
but the king was cam
when we struck the boat she was about done loading and pretty soon she got off
well they could be worse off
jim cleaned up the canoe and i got my paddle ready
she sent out her yawl and we went aboard and she was from cincinnati and when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad and gave us a cussing and said they wouldnt land us
he says
yes but that aint only a part of it
he had houses and land and its reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up somers
i done it of course
because shes a big orleans boat and i was afeard she mightnt stop there
he most desperately wanted to see harvey and william too for that matter because he was one of them kind that cant bear to make a will
peter and george were the only ones that come out here george was the married brother him and his wife both died last year
oh he lives in england sheffield preaches there hasnt ever been in this country
why he didnt only look like he was dead he looked considerable more than that
when did you say he died
go for the steamboat huckleberry well come down to the village on her
how old is the others
the kings duds was all black and he did look real swell and starchy
jump out and hep the gentleman adolphus meaning me i see
poor things to be left alone in the cold world so
i want to be near to themto help them
olive chancellor received this appeal with peculiar feelings
our movement is for allit appeals to the most delicate ladies
she had been laughed at but she never knew it she was treated as a bore but she never cared
i know several that i should like to have
she knew her place in the boston hierarchy and it was not what mrs farrinder supposed so that there was a want of perspective in talking to her as if she had been a representative of the aristocracy
raise the standard among them and bring me a thousand names
i cant talk to those people i cant said olive chancellor with a face which seemed to plead for a remission of responsibility
the unhappiness of women
have you got money
they cared far more about charlie than about the ballot
i want to do somethingoh i should like so to speak
she had been consumed by the passion of sympathy it had crumpled her into as many creases as an old glazed distended glove
his family was ruined they had lost their slaves their property their friends and relations their home had tasted of all the cruelty of defeat
there was nothing in the world so personal as mrs luna her sister could have hated her for it if she had not forbidden herself this emotion as directed to individuals
she saw when once she had looked at him that he would not put those worldly interpretations on things which with her it was both an impulse and a principle to defy
the state of mississippi seemed to him the state of despair so he surrendered the remnants of his patrimony to his mother and sisters and at nearly thirty years of age alighted for the first time in new york in the costume of his province with fifty dollars in his pocket and a gnawing hunger in his heart
miss olive chancellor it may be confided to the reader to whom in the course of our history i shall be under the necessity of imparting much occult information was subject to fits of tragic shyness during which she was unable to meet even her own eyes in the mirror
this was written so intensely in her delicate face that he felt an unformulated pity for her before they had exchanged twenty words
nothing could be more displeasing than this indifference when people didnt agree with you
she knew what her mother would have done and that helped her decision for her mother always chose the positive course
chancellor had passed away so it was for olive left alone in the little house in charles street adeline being in europe to decide
one of them was to the effect that the simplest division it is possible to make of the human race is into the people who take things hard and the people who take them easy
it proved nothing of any importance with regard to miss chancellor to say that she was morbid any sufficient account of her would lie very much to the rear of that
she was reassured at finding that her visitor was peculiar the way he spoke told her that it was no wonder he had fought on the southern side
one of these fits had suddenly seized her now without any obvious cause though indeed mrs luna had made it worse by becoming instantly so personal
that was the way he liked themnot to think too much not to feel any responsibility for the government of the world such as he was sure miss chancellor felt
he had not seeking his fortune come away from the blighted south which weighed upon his heart to look out for tragedies at least he didnt want them outside of his office in pine street
it was the usual things of life that filled her with silent rage which was natural enough inasmuch as to her vision almost everything that was usual was iniquitous
whether much or little consideration had been directed to the result miss chancellor certainly would not have incurred this reproach
she had erected it into a sort of rule of conduct that whenever she saw a risk she was to take it and she had frequent humiliations at finding herself safe after all
she had no difficulty in asking him now whether he would not stay to dinnershe hoped adeline had given him her message
by the time basil came to the northmaking advances as it weremrs
he perceived very quickly that miss chancellor belonged to the former class
if they would only be private and passive and have no feeling but for that and leave publicity to the sex of tougher hide
it was the same sort of impulse that had moved her to write to basil ransom in the spring after hearing accidentally that he had come to the north and intended in new york to practise his profession
he was on his guard against generalisations which might be hasty but he had arrived at two or three that were of value to a gentleman lately admitted to the new york bar and looking out for clients
she was perfectly safe after writing to basil ransom and indeed it was difficult to see what he could have done to her except thank her he was only exceptionally superlative for her letter and assure her that he would come and see her the first time his business he was beginning to get a little should take him to boston
the women he had hitherto known had been mainly of his own soft clime and it was not often they exhibited the tendency he detected and cursorily deplored in mrs lunas sister
she had never yet encountered a personage so exotic and she always felt more at her ease in the presence of anything strange
it was in the female line as basil ransom had written in answering her letter with a good deal of form and flourish he spoke as if they had been royal houses
ransom was pleased with the vision of that remedy it must be repeated that he was very provincial
she was habited in a plain dark dress without any ornaments and her smooth colourless hair was confined as carefully as that of her sister was encouraged to stray
the young man was therefore free to look at her a contemplation which showed him that she was agitated and trying to conceal it
he was sorry for her but he saw in a flash that no one could help her that was what made her tragic
he was too simpletoo mississippianfor that she was almost disappointed
but this pale girl with her light green eyes her pointed features and nervous manner was visibly morbid it was as plain as day that she was morbid
he wondered why she was agitated not foreseeing that he was destined to discover later that her nature was like a skiff in a stormy sea
you look as if you were
his dishonesty however only exposed him the more
try to reform him a person from mississippi is sure to be all wrong
dont come out my sister has the first claim
she didnt believe he had ever heard of her mrs luna though he pretended with his southern chivalry that he had
he was tall and lean and dressed throughout in black his shirt collar was low and wide and the triangle of linen a little crumpled exhibited by the opening of his waistcoat was adorned by a pin containing a small red stone
basil ransom coloured a little
thats the way i found her when i returned from europe
basil ransom had got up just as mrs luna made this last declaration for a young lady had glided into the room who stopped short as it fell upon her ears
you might have known what
mrs luna explained to her sister that her freedom of speech was caused by his being a relationthough indeed he didnt seem to know much about them
if you thought i lived in new york why in the world didnt you come and see me the lady inquired
shes a female jacobinshes a nihilist
well that miss chancellor would be all that you say
she hates it she would like to abolish it
basil ransom stared the yellow light in his brown eyes deepened
good bye mr ransom mrs luna continued gathering up the feathery white shawl which added to the volume of her fairness
yes very basil ransom replied with a smile and the curious feminine softness with which southern gentlemen enunciate that adverb
why whats the use of that
are you very ambitious
but it isnt the same she said
they had invented it while she was away
this is a librivox recording
well you see i dont go out much except to the courts
she was attractive and impertinent especially the latter
if you are going to dine with her you had better know it
she was brought up in the city of reform
a radical
this last remark he made at a venture for he had naturally not devoted any supposition whatever to mrs luna
perhaps that is one
neither five nor fifteen and yet not ten exactly but either nine or eleven
i pretend not to prevaricate
and indeed he was very long basil ransom and he even looked a little hard and discouraging like a column of figures in spite of the friendly face which he bent upon his hostesss deputy and which in its thinness had a deep dry line a sort of premature wrinkle on either side of the mouth
i am glad i havent opinions that prevent my dressing in the evening she declared from the doorway
oh murder murmured the young man vaguely sinking back in his chair with his arms folded
mrs luna looked up at all this but saw only a part of it otherwise she would not have replied in a bantering manner in answer to his inquiry are you ever different from this mrs luna was familiarintolerably familiar
olive will come down in about ten minutes she told me to tell you that
do you mean the law courts
in spite of this decoration the young man looked pooras poor as a young man could look who had such a fine head and such magnificent eyes
then he said oh yes when i dine out i usually carry a six shooter and a bowie knife and he took up his hat vaguelya soft black hat with a low crown and an immense straight brim mrs luna wanted to know what he was doing
and if she said it she does really hope it
mrs luna glanced at him from head to foot and gave a little smiling sigh as if he had been a long sum in addition
it might have been likened to a thin ray of moonlight resting upon the wall of a prison
well so it is they are all witches and wizards mediums and spirit rappers and roaring radicals
by henry james
he threw it down at the approach of mrs luna laughed shook hands with her and said in answer to her last remark you imply that you do tell fibs
while you and your little boy dont the young man remarked
have you been in europe ransom asked
you only stay to morrow
well mind you come and see me in new york i shall be sure to be part of the winter there
she stood there looking consciously and rather seriously at mr ransom a smile of exceeding faintness played about her lipsit was just perceptible enough to light up the native gravity of her face
she made him sit down she assured him that her sister quite expected him would feel as sorry as she could ever feel for anythingfor she was a kind of fatalist anyhowif he didnt stay to dinner
his forehead was high and broad and his thick black hair perfectly straight and glossy and without any division rolled back from it in a leonine manner
these words were spoken with much volubility by a fair plump smiling woman who entered a narrow drawing room in which a visitor kept waiting for a few moments was already absorbed in a book
no i havent been anywhere
has your sister
she is willing to risk that
well i suppose i might have known that he continued at last
all librivox recordings are in the public domain
mercy yes
just as i am the visitor inquired presenting himself with rather a work a day aspect
oh no i never differ from newton and mrs luna added that now she was back she didnt know what she should do
that has an unflattering sound for me said the young man
daphne cried hermon in grateful agitation but she would not listen to him and followed the soldier whom the captain detailed to guide her into the palace
then daphne herself threw her arms around his neck with fervent devotion
but hermon with drooping head murmured to morrow i shall no longer be what i am now
words can not express the strength of my devotion but for that very reason i must do what duty commands before i ask the question will you join your fate to mine
daphne taken from him he knew not whither nor for how long a time after he had just been assured of her great love
in the name of the dead he thanked his dear comrades for the enthusiastic appreciation his masterpiece had found
forward he called blithely and boldly to the officer while crates with loud lamentations was protesting his innocence to the warrior who was putting fetters upon him
the ill disposed insisted that hermon had only done what duty commanded the meanest man and the fact that he had deceived all alexandria still remained
the old mans conversation with hermon was interrupted by the functionaries who subjected him and crates to the examination
i must remain blind but you have restored the lost sight to my poor darkened soul
when thyone in her presence heard from gras that hermon intended to go to procluss banquet she started up in horror exclaiming then the unfortunate man is lost
daphne again pleaded for the liberation of the prisoners but philippus silenced her with the grave exclamation the order of the king
what a terrible ordeal again awaits you
perhaps it would be well for him to leave alexandria now and she described how much benefit she had received while hunting from the silence of the wilderness when she had left the noise of the city behind her
the goal of the nocturnal walk which was close at hand was reached at the end of a few minutes and the prisoners were delivered to the commander of the diadochi
then daphne on her knees besought the matron to tell her what threatened hermon and succeeded in persuading her to speak
bring this before your mind and everything else that you must accept with it if you consent when the time arrives to become mine conceal and palliate nothing
the prisoner listened in surprise and anxiety
oh my poor deceived love cried daphne strongly agitated in a tone of the deepest sorrow
even daphnes image and what threatened her father and her with him receded far into the background
lastly with earnest warmth she besought him before taking the prisoners away to permit her to speak to the commanding general philippus her fathers guest who she was certain was in the palace
it was repulsive to endow this explanation of an unfortunate error with a captivating aspect by any theatrical adornment
even had his eyes retained the power of sight his blood was coursing so wildly through his veins that he might perhaps have been unable to distinguish the statues around him and the thousands of spectators who crowded closely together richly garlanded their cheeks glowing with enthusiasm surrounded the arena
hermon again warmly embraced daphne saying then go
she too quickly retained them and murmured softly
his keen ear could not deceive him and yet a demon must be mocking him for the voice that had called his name was the girls of whom in the presence of welcome death he had thought with longing regret
the time allowed had expired
no one stopped them
noise and dazzling radiance are hostile to the purer light morning and day will rise quietly from the starving sand
her husband who had long trusted even the gravest secrets to his discreet old wife had informed her of the terrible office the king had confided to him
his uncle driven from his secure possessions to distant lands
daphne of course would accompany him
sometimes with touching entreaty sometimes with imperious command she protested after giving him her name that this matter could be nothing but an unfortunate mistake
certainly he answered firmly
for the first time his lips met hers he confessed his love and that he had just regarded death as a deliverer but his life was now gaining new charm through her affection
the gray haired comrade of alexander accompanied her and after a few minutes both prisoners were released from their fetters
nothing can cloud what these brief moments have bestowed
was he to be led to the executioners block
he himself on the way to expose himself to the malice and mockery of the whole city
whatever might await him he desired no better fate
early the next morning they should be examined and if they could clear themselves from the suspicion of belonging to the ranks of the conspirators released
the blood of these innocent men would be on his head if he did not listen to her representations
on the way his heart throbbed almost to bursting
the old commander offered no objection to her wish to accompany hermon to prison
he was appearing before his companions only to give truth its just due
i love you and have loved you always daphne exclaimed tenderly
soon to morrow eventhere will be no one in alexandria who can accuse me of deserting my own honest aspiration and if the gods will only restore my sight and the ability to use my hands as a sculptor then girl then
many will not believe me and even your father will perhaps consider it a disgrace to give his arm to his scorned calumniated nephew to guide him home
but only wait wait
the egyptian obeyed and his master crossed the wide space strewn with sand and approached the stage which had been erected for the festal performances
yet no
it is the work of myrtilus
did he still possess the right to award this noble branch to any one
what more is needed
not a sound if you value your lives
only his heart grew heavy at the thought of leaving daphne to the tireless wooer philotas or some othereverything else from which it is usually hard to part seemed like a burden that we gladly cast aside
what pleasure had life to offer him the blind man who was already dead to his art
it seems nevertheless as if i ought to rejoice for you and your art have not spoken to me even a single moment from this much lauded work
the atrium usually swarming with guards servants and officials until a far later hour was completely deserted when the blind man hurried through it with his friend
wherever the beloved dead might be he desired to go there also
honour to myrtilus and his art but he trusted this noble festal assemblage would pardon the unintentional deception and aid his prayer for recovery
then daphne raised her face to his asking so the demeter is the work of myrtilus
we will beseech the immortals with prayers and sacrifices to restore sight to your artist eyes
he might now have been permitted to bind forever to his life the woman who had just rescued him from the greatest danger but the confession he must make to his fellow artists in the palaestra the following morning still sealed his lips
after a few moments which the blind artist used to inspire the despairing scholar with courage the girl returned and she did not come alone
the lovers took leave of each other with one last kiss and the final words of the departing girl echoed consolingly in the blind mans heart the more they take from you the more closely i will cling to you
in spite of his deep mental distress he could have shouted aloud in his delight and gratitude
probably every man thought that in the same situation he would have done the same yet not only justicenay compassiondictated showing the blind artist that they believed in and would sustain him
even while he believed himself to be the creator of the demeter he had been seriously troubled by the praise of so many critics because it had exposed him to the suspicion of having become faithless to his art and his nature
when he again descended to the arena new plaudits rose but soon hisses and other signs of disapproval blended with them which increased in strength and number when a well known critic who had written a learned treatise concerning the relation of the demeter to hermons earlier works expressed his annoyance in a loud whistle
to morrow you shall confess to me who treacherously directed you to this dangerous path
chapter eight
again he heard the beloved voice and this time it addressed not only him but with the utmost haste the commander of the soldiers
without a word of explanation hermon dragged his guide along in breathless haste
yet he was forced to advise the blind sculptor to leave alexandria
grateful and moved by joyous hopes he informed daphne of the words of the oracle which had imprinted themselves upon his memory
if he had passed into annihilation he hermon wished to follow him thither and annihilation certainly meant redemption from pain and misery
was it really nothing but foolish vanity that led me to the conviction that you were thinking of me also when you engraved on the ribbon the despised spider for which however i always felt a certain regardwith the delicate web beneath its slender legs
the remembrance of arsinoes undignified conduct at the dionysia and the shameful stories of her which he had heard returned to his mind
chapter seven
hermon replied that he had heard several make this criticism but the priests of the goddess refused to take it into account
perhaps her arrival would relieve him from the discomfort which oppressed him here
at the same time he saw daphne rise before him in her aristocratic dignity and kindly goodness and a smile of satisfaction hovered around his lips as he said to himself the spider althea again
would his troubled spirit at least permit him to enjoy and enter without restraint into the play of her quick wit
the queen was not to appear until after the feast when the mixing jars were filled
what was recognition
yet what mattered it even if these miserable people considered themselves deceived and pointed the finger of scorn at him
he would frankly inform her of his fear and her truthful nature would find the doubt that gnawed his heart as unendurable as he himself
his errand was to invite him to a banquet which was to take place that evening at his residence in a wing of the royal palace
oh if only his myrtilus still walked among the living
the most aristocratic was amyntas who stood highest of all in the queens favour because he had good reason to hate the other arsinoe the sister of the king
all were members of the highest class of society and their manners showed the entire freedom from restraint that existed in the queens immediate circle
hitherto the merchant had been induced it is true to advance large sums of money to the queen but the loyal devotion which he showed to her royal husband had rendered it impossible to give him even a hint of the conspiracy
let us hope that you will make this three leaved clover the luck promising four leaved one
though so loud a denial is written on your face i persist in my conviction and that no idle delusion ensnares me i can prove
the sovereign was as unaccustomed to the society of a blind artist as hermon was to that of a queen and both eagerly anticipated the approaching meeting
during many a sleepless hour of the night he had once more heard the rolling of her terrible wheel
hermon entered his house with drooping head
her age
he was transported as if by magic to the hour of his return from pelusium he saw himself enter myrtiluss studio and watch his friend scratch something he did not know what upon the ribbon which fastened the bunch of golden grain
the queen might have appeared already and it would not do to keep her waiting
althea profited by the advantage of being hermons only acquaintance here
how indifferent you look
not hemyrtilus and he alone was the creator of the much lauded demeter
the dead myrtilus created it
had i not made it a rule to maintain absolute silence concerning everything i hear in conversation from those with whom i am closely associated
very true althea assented
time pressed
the approval as well as the doubts which it aroused in others strengthened his opinion although even now he could not succeed in bringing it into harmony with the facts
it wasnay it could have been nothing elsethat very spider
but i tell youher deep blue eyes flashed as she spokethat so long as you were still a genuine creating artist the case was different even while putting the last touches of the file to the demeter for which archiass devout daughter posed as your model another whom you could not banish from your mind filled your imagination
hermon listened to the pair in silence
when hermon entered the residence of the grammateus in the palace the guests had already assembled
crates had really been invited in order to win him over to the queens cause but charming fair haired nico had been commissioned by the conspirators to persuade him to sing arsinoes praises among his professional associates
how the exchange had occurred he could not now understand but to disbelieve that it had taken place would have been madness or self deception
since his return from the oracle the fear that the rescued demeter might yet be the work of myrtilus had again mastered him
the grammateus alluded to this and most positively insisted that he could not release him for he came not only by his own wish but in obedience to the command of queen arsinoe who desired to tell the creator of the demeter how highly she esteemed his work and his art
crates bewildered and prepared for the worst obeyed his wish but althea and the other guests left behind felt more and more impressed by the suddenly awakened conviction that the hapless blind man had now also become the victim of madness
however loudly outward circumstances might oppose this he now felt with a certainty which surprised him that this work was not his own
she perceived this with annoyance and perplexity
eternal gods
so the artist found himself obliged to relinquish his opposition
she will make our poor queen suffer unless real friends guard her from the worst
she would appear herself at dessert and the banquet must therefore begin at an unusually early hour
the artist was surprised to find this man in such a circle but he learned from althea that the young member of the museum was a relative of proclus and a suitor of the beautiful nico one of the queens ladies in waiting who was among the guests
the banquet was to begin in a few hours yet he could not let the day pass without seeing daphne and telling her the words of the oracle
better people would thereby be robbed of the right to accuse him of faithlessness to himself
the royal lady had inquired about him and his sufferings with almost sisterly interest and althea eagerly confirmed the statement
how bewildered you look
but we are in egypt where marriages between brothers and sisters are pleasing to gods and men and besides we make our own moral laws here
the kings sisterthe object of his love cried hermon incredulously she must be forty years old now
but in spite of my blindness i will be caught neither in her net nor in the queens
what was applause
not the smallest detail of a work produced by the hand of a valued friend escapes my notice and i perceived it before the demeter came to the temple and the lofty pedestal
many things are forgotten after long months have passed but it will be easy for me to sharpen your memory
only let me get out of doors into the open air
he proclus was to have the high honour of including the royal lady among his guests solely on hermons account and his refusal would be an insult to the queen
but hermon was not in the mood to share a joyous revel and he frankly said so although immediately after his return he had accepted the invitation to the festival which the whole fellowship of artists would give the following day in honour of the seventieth birthday of the old sculptor euphranor
true an interesting conversation still had power to charm him but often during its continuance the full consciousness of his misfortune forced itself upon his mind for the majority of the subjects discussed by the artists came to them through the medium of sight and referred to new creations of architecture sculpture and painting from whose enjoyment his blindness debarred him
a stranger out of his own sphere he felt chilled among these closely united men and women to whom no tie bound him save the presence of the same host
only even though love has wholly disappeared she still claims consideration and althea did not wish to lose hermons regard
that is going too far replied hermon
this conviction raised a hundred pound weight from his soul
hitherto hermon had listened to every word in silence labouring for breath
then he went directly to the neighbouring palace
how totally different in spite of his lost vision would his life have been
yet it was difficult for hermon to turn a bright face toward his companion
a woman who yearns for the regard of all men and makes love a toy easily lessens the demands she imposes upon individuals
here he hesitated for like a blow from an invisible hand the thought darted through his mind that perhaps on the morrow he would see himself compelled before the whole world to cast aside the crown of fame which he owed to the statue on the lofty pedestal
this they agreed to do on condition that she put the torch to her house at daybreak
from harrisonville she went to waverly where she was hounded continually
these young women were thrown into an old rickety two story house located between fourteenth and fifteenth streets on grand avenue kansas city missouri
the railroads had not reached jackson county and wild game was plentiful on my fathers farm on big creek near lees summit
a daughter kate who was asleep upstairs was rescued from the flames by her sister
when i was taken prisoner i expected to be shot without ceremony
when my father returned from washington and learned of these outrages he went to kansas city missouri headquarters of the state militia to see if anything could be done
all this was cruelty indeed and enough to harden and embitter the softest of hearts but it was mild compared with the continuous suffering and torture imposed upon my mother during the years from eighteen sixty two to eighteen seventy
this was before the conflicts and troubles centered on our home that planted a bitterness in my young heart which cried out for revenge and this feeling was only accentuated by the cruelties of war which followed
one of the numerous books purporting to be a history of my life states with the utmost soberness that as a boy i was cruel to dumb animals and to my schoolmates and as for my teachers to them i was a continual trouble and annoyance
his horse was tied to a tree and his body left lying where it fell
mrs washington wells and her son samuel on the road home from kansas city to lees summit recognized the body as that of my father
one of the conditions upon which her life was spared was that she would report at lexington weekly
i refer in particular to the shameful and cowardly murder of my father for money which he was known to have in his possession and the cruel treatment of my mother at the hands of the missouri militia
while in washington attending to some business regarding this matter a raid was made by the kansas jayhawkers upon the livery stable and stage line for several miles out into the country the robbers also looting his store and destroying his property generally
i went home one night to get medicine for the boys wounded in the battle of lone jack whom i was nursing in the woods some miles away
there was soon the dreaded cry the militia are surrounding the house and in the excitement which followed suse dashed open the door to find a score of bayonets in her face
it was born in the blood
nothing could have proved her faithfulness more effectually than an incident connected with one of my stolen visits home
my people had always been prominent politically
quantrell sometimes spares but anderson never became a tradition of the kansas line
my father was in the employ of the united states government and had the mail contract for five hundred miles
one of my old school teachers whom i have never seen since the spring or summer of eighteen sixty two is stephen b elkins senator from west virginia
a hundred of my friends and schoolmates will bear me out in the statement that far from being cruel to either dumb animals or human beings i was always regarded as kind and considerate to both
the youngers came from strasburg and helped to rule there when it was a free city henry washington younger my father represented jackson county three times in the legislature and was also judge of the county court
as soon as i saw cole younger i felt a sense of relief because i had known him and his parents long and favorably and as soon as i got a chance i told him frankly what i feared and that i hoped he would manage to take care of me and save me from being killed
in september eighteen sixty three soldiers ransacked the harris home stole everything they considered valuable and burned the house
but this garden spot was destined to be a bloody battle ground when the nation divided
mother was descended from the sullivans ladens and percivals of south carolina the taylors of virginia and the fristoes of tennessee and my grandfather fristoe was a grand nephew of chief justice john marshall of virginia
among the women who lost their lives was miss josephine anderson whose cruel death simply blighted her brothers life and so filled him with determination to revenge that he afterward became the most desperate of desperate men
his home was friendly to every confederate soldier and scout in the west information newspapers and the like left there were certain to be kept for the right hands
mrs mccorkle jumped from the window of the house and escaped
he had started back to harrisonville in a buggy but was waylaid one mile south of westport a suburb of kansas city and brutally murdered falling out of his buggy into the road with three mortal bullet wounds
my brother james was born january fifteenth eighteen forty eight john in eighteen fifty one and robert in december eighteen fifty three
on reaching the camp the first person i saw whom i knew was cole younger
walley afterwards caused the arrest of my cousins fearing that they had recognized him and his men
these hatreds were soon to make trouble for me of which i had never dreamed
it was noted that the groceryman had moved his stock of groceries from the building in time to save it from ruin showing that the wrecking of the house was planned in cold blood with the murder of my sisters and cousins and the other unfortunate women in mind
i cannot remember when i did not know how to shoot
mine was a happy childhood
walley and his gang of the missouri militia whose hands are stained with the blood of my father
two months after this incident the same persecutors again entered our home in the dead of the night and at the point of a pistol tried to force my mother to set fire to her own home
my eldest brother richard died in eighteen sixty
i have always felt that the exposure to which she was subjected on this cruel journey too hard even for a man to take was the direct cause of her death
after the murder of my father she was so annoyed at her home in harrisonville that she sought peace at her country residence eight and a half miles north of town
anderson was then ripe for the raid on lawrence
as i sat talking with my mother two of my brothers watched at the windows
the down stairs was used as a grocery store
this occurred just before i entered the union army and it was generally known and i am sure cole knew that i was strongly for the union and about to enter the army
why dont you call on cole younger now
as the raiders left one of them shouted
twenty five other women were also prisoners there at that time including three of my own sisters
before he died in a skirmish with northern troops in eighteen sixty four he had tied fifty three knots in a silken cord which he carried in his buckskin pouch
every knot represented a human life
a virginian by birth and a school teacher for many years in various parts of missouri he was well known throughout the state as an active sympathizer with the south
my father owned slaves and his children were reared in ease though the border did not then abound in what would now be called luxury
after six months of living death in this trap the house was secretly undermined and fell with the prisoners only five of whom escaped injury or death
naturally we were southerners in sympathy and in fact
the younger brothers maintained a good reputation in the community where they lived and were well esteemed as were their parents for their good conduct and character
boyhood days
they were good people and among the pioneers on the western border of missouri
he assured me he would do all he could to protect me cole younger told quantrell that my father and brother were in the rebel army and were good fighters and that i had stayed at home to take care of my mother that i was a good fellow and a non combatant
tuesday night we were at cordova a little village in le sueur county and wednesday night in millersburg eleven miles west of northfield
at last the boys who had been in the bank came out
bob however did not see wheeler who was upstairs in the hotel behind him and wheelers third shot shattered bobs right elbow as he stood beneath the stairs
pitts then ran to the vault and stepped inside whereupon heywood followed him and tried to shut him in
then he told me they had been drinking and had made a botch of it inside the bank
what kept you so long i asked pitts
i told pitts to put him up with me and i would pack him out but when we lifted him i saw he was dead and i told pitts to lay him down again
when we came up i told miller to shut the bank door which they had left open in their hurry
while pitts and i were waiting for bob and chadwell we scouted about going to madelia and as far as the eastern part of cotton wood county to familiarize ourselves with the country
every time i saw any one with a bead on me i would drop off my horse and try to drive the shooter inside but i could not see in every direction
bob ran down the street toward manning who hurried into lee and hitchcocks store hoping in that way to get a shot at bob from behind
i stayed there pointing my pistol at any one who showed his head until pitts had gone perhaps thirty or forty yards and then putting spurs to my horse i galloped to where he was and took him up behind me
while we were planning the raid it was intended that i should be one of the party to go into the bank
the shutters were closed and this caused bunker an instants delay that was almost fatal
governor john s pillsbury first offered one thousand dollars reward for the arrest of the six who had escaped and this he changed afterward to one thousand dollars for each of them dead or alive
what if they begin shooting at us some one suggested
we had no time to wreck the telegraph office and the alarm was soon sent throughout the country
j s allen whose hardware store was near tried to go into the bank but miller ordered him away and he ran around the corner shouting
i do not believe they killed any one however
finally a few days later the boys joined us having bought their horses at mankato
the first one missed him but the second went through his right shoulder
get your guns boys theyre robbing the bank
bunker tried to get a pistol that lay near him but pitts saw his movement and beat him to it
well said bob if cap is so particular about the shooting suppose we let him stay outside and take his chances
with a flourish of his revolver one of the robbers pointed to joseph l heywood head bookkeeper who was acting as cashier in the absence of that official and asked
as to the rest of the affair inside the bank i take the account of a northfield narrator
the hotel was full of lawyers and they with the judge and other court attendants had a high old time that night
instead of carrying out the plan originally formed seizing the cashier at his window and getting to the safe without interruption they leaped right over the counter and scared heywood at the very start
there were no saddle horses in evidence and we calculated that we would have a considerable advantage
if any of our party shot him it must have been woods
miller was lying in the street but we thought him still alive
a man named elias stacy armed with a shot gun fired at miller just as he was mounting his horse filling clells face full of bird shot
but between the time we broke camp and the time they reached the bridge the three who went ahead drank a quart of whisky and there was the initial blunder at northfield
i called to the boys in the bank to come out for i could not imagine what was keeping them so long
i dismounted in the street pretending to tighten my saddle girth
i have always believed that the man nicholas gustavson who was shot in the street and who it was said did not go inside because he did not understand english was hit by a glancing shot from mannings or wheelers rifle
you are the cashier said the robber turning upon heywood who was sitting at the cashiers desk
the northfield raid
pitts chased him with a bullet
no replied heywood and the same question was put to a e bunker teller and frank j wilcox assistant bookkeeper each of whom made the same reply
we reunited thursday morning september seventh a little outside northfield west of the cannon river
are you the cashier
we then divided into two parties and started for northfield by somewhat different routes
manning took a shot at pitts horse killing it which crippled us badly meantime the street was getting uncomfortably hot
we took a trip into town that forenoon and i looked over the bank
as the men left the bank heywood clambered to his feet and pitts in his liquor shot him through the head inflicting the wound that killed him
we had dinner at various places and then returned to the camp
with his second shot manning wounded me in the thigh and with his third he shot chadwell through the heart
open that safequick or ill blow your head off
shermans characterizationwar is hell
hays in recruiting a regiment around my old home
several confederates followed the young confederate into the room and i heard them call him cole younger
my brother and i both supposed to be mortally wounded were in the same bed
they did mark my clothes in one or two places however
joseph o shelby
accordingly i was shortly awakened to accompany him to lone jack where he would personally make known the situation to the other colonels
we want to attack foster and beat him in the morning he will just be a nice breakfast spell
soon after the confederates returned
about an hour after the confederates left the field the ranking officer who took command when i became unconscious gathered his men together and returned to lexington
we were out of ammunition and were helpless had the fight been pressed
i believe he still retains those qualities and would prove himself as good a citizen as we have among us if set free and would fight for the stars and stripes as fearlessly as he did for the southern flag i have never seen him since the battle of lone jack
quantrell was not in the fight at lone jack at all but jarrette and gregg did come up with some of quantrells men just at the end and were in the chase back toward lexington
hays had encamped after independence
i know much of the conditions and circumstances under which the youngers were placed after the war and knowing this i have great sympathy for them
at the same time he was obtaining from the chicago and saint louis papers and other sources information about the northern armies which was conveyed by couriers to confederate officers in the south and he kept concealed along the missouri river skiffs and ferry boats to enable the confederate officers recruiting north of the river to have free access to the south
jackman with a party of thirty seasoned men charged the indiana guns and captured them but major foster led a gallant charge against the invaders and recaptured the pieces
on the way back he asked me what i thought about foster being a breakfast spell
cockrell in command of the confederate forces and stated the case to him
riding to the still house where we had left the wagon munitions we had taken a few days before at independence i obtained a fresh supply and started for the action on the gallop
hays and i arrived had his men drawn up in line of battle while the officers were holding a council in his quarters
no lieutenant ill go too
about nine thirty a m i was shot down
during the progress of the fight my attention was called to a young confederate riding in front of the confederate line distributing ammunition to the men from what seemed to be a splint basket he rode along under a most galling fire from our side the entire length of the confederate lines and when he had at last disappeared our boys recognized his gallantry in ringing cheers
lone jack
major foster in a letter to judge george m bennett of minneapolis said
the wounded of both forces were gathered up and were placed in houses
cockrell
he was personally known to me and had been my enemy from before the war
he also called the young man cole younger and directed him to guard the house which he did
he said he and his men had just shot a lieutenant of a cass county company whom they found wounded and that he would shoot me and my brother
the first man who entered my room was a guerrilla followed by a dozen or more men who seemed to obey him
he might be all right for dinner
gideon w thompson
jim and john were at home at lees summit
this was the day the gate was robbed at kansas city
i went through independence and from there to ace webbs
poor john he has been hunted down and shot like a wild beast and never was a boy more innocent
this can be proved by both of them also by sheriff barkley and fifty other respectable men of that county
at the time of the gallatin bank robbery i was gathering cattle in ellis county texas cattle that i bought from pleas taylor and rector
there were fifty or a hundred persons there who will testify in any court that john and i were there
he was not at home but the family will remember that we were there
i met several of my friends
as there was no other robbery committed until january i will come to that time
about the last of december eighteen seventy three i arrived in carroll parish louisiana
brother john was with me
on reading since my release the pretended history of my life i find that i was wrong in stating that there was no robbery during the summer of eighteen seventy two the bank at columbia kentucky having been raided april twenty ninth of that year
although every book purporting to narrate the lives of the younger brothers has told of the liberty robbery and implied that we had a part in it the youngers were not suspected at that time nor for a long time afterward
thomas coleman younger
november fifteenth eighteen seventy four i wrote a letter to my brother in law lycargus a jones which was published in part in the pleasant hill review november twenty sixth the editor having in the meantime inquired into the statements of facts and satisfied himself of their truth
i will give you this outline and sketch of my whereabouts and actions at the time of certain robberies with which i am charged
among them was bob hudspeth
ray
next day john and i went to kansas city
there i took dinner and then went to dr l w twymans
we crossed the river at blue mills and went up on the other side
the parts of this letter now relevant are as follows
jailer griffin and his fifteenyear old son were killed there warrants were issued for a number of the old guerrillas including allen parmer afterward the husband of susie james although he was working in kansas city at the time and proved an absolute alibi
dr l lewis was his physician
i knew a c mccoy during the war but have never seen him since notwithstanding the appleton city paper says he has been with us in that county for two years
stayed there until after supper then went to silas hudspeths and stayed all night
we were not on good terms at the time nor have we been for several years
dickersons near floyd
this raid was accompanied by bloodshed judge mclain the banker being shot though not fatally
it was charged that arthur mccoy or a c mccoy and myself had been participants in the gads hill affair and the two stage robberies
and as for a c mccoy john never saw him in his life
john hadnt seen either of them for eighteen months before his death
from that time on mine and johns names have been connected with the james brothers
our business there was to see e p west
where he got his authority i dont know but one thing i do know he had none from me
you may use this letter in your own way
the gate at the fair grounds was robbed that fall
ridges
the romancers have connected jim and me with that when as a matter of fact i was in louisiana jim and bob were at dallas and john was in california
it was immediately following the rock island robbery at adair iowa that there first appeared a deliberate enlistment of some local papers in missouri to connect us with this robbery
during the time the shreveport stage and the hot springs stage were robbed also the gads hill robbery
jim white and j f edmunson were arrested in saint joseph but were promptly released their preliminary examination failing to connect them with the raid in any way
i was in jackson county at the time
i stayed there until the eighth of february eighteen seventy four
we crossed on the bridge stayed in the city all night and the next morning we rode up through the city
laurels unsought
i left r p roses that morning went down the independence road stopped at dr nolands and got some pills
but they soon after got close enough so that one of them broke my walking stick with a shot
pitts i said if you want to go out and surrender go on
bobs shattered elbow was requiring frequent attention and that night we made only nine miles and monday monday night and tuesday we spent in a deserted farm house close to mankato
w w murphy col
on the prairie our maps were all right but when we got into the big woods and among the lakes we were practically lost
some of the boys wanted to kill him on the theory that dead men tell no tales while others urged binding him and leaving him in the woods
we were at bay on the open prairie surrounded by a picket line of forty men some of whom would fight
theyre all down but me
not prepared to stand for our last fight against such odds on the open field we fell back into the watonwan river bottoms and took refuge in some bushes
coward
sheriff glispin of watonwan county who was taking bobs pistol from him was also shouting to the fellow
that day a man named dunning discovered us and we took him prisoner
a bullet had pierced bobs right lung but he was the only one left on his feet
we had been living on scant rations corn watermelon and other vegetables principally but in spite of this bobs arm was mending somewhat
we were in a strange country
but the only mob that came was the mob of sightseers reporters and detectives
they came up with us as we were fording a small slough and unable to ford it with their horses they were delayed somewhat by having to go around it
he had to sleep with it pillowed on my breast jim being also crippled with a wound in his shoulder and we could not get much sleep
i can die as well as you can
sheriff glispin swore we would never be mobbed as long as we were his prisoners
we passed dundas on the run before the news of the robbery had reached there and at millersburg too we were in advance of the news but at shieldsville we were behind it
one of the fellows in the outer line not brave enough himself to join the volunteers who had come in to beat us out was not disposed to believe in the surrender and had his gun levelled on bob in spite of the handkerchief which was waving as a flag of truce
we did not permit them to get their weapons until we had watered our horses and got a fresh start
ill not shoot
if they do come and i weaken he said you can have your pistols
meanwhile we were planning too
they overtook us about four miles west of shieldsville and shots were exchanged without effect on either side
here a squad of men who we afterwards learned were from faribault had left their guns outside a house
meantime our pursuers were watching for horsemen not finding our abandoned horses it seems until monday or tuesday
a chase to the death
that night it started to rain and we wore out our horses
come on
no sooner however was he released than he made posthaste into mankato to announce our presence and in a few minutes another posse was looking for us
we were taken to his hotel and a guard posted
i surrender he had shouted
vought of the flanders house a damaging suggestion which proved the ultimate undoing of our party
make for the horses i said
his right arm useless and his pistol empty he had no choice
there is no use stopping to pick up a comrade here for we cant get him through the line just charge them and make it if we can
at every stopping place we left marks of blood from our wounds and could have been easily trailed had not the pursuers been led in the track of our recent companions
the wound in my thigh was troubling me and i had to walk with a cane i cut in the brush one place we got a chicken and cooked it only to be interrupted before we could have our feast having to make a quick dash for cover
we were prepared to wait as long as they would but they were not of the waiting kind
six stepped to the front sheriff glispin col
suspecting however that he would do so we were soon on the move and that night we evaded the guard at the blue earth river bridge and about midnight made our way through mankato
every man for himself
ill not go he replied game to the last
t l vought b m rice g a bradford c a pomeroy and s j severson
the whistle on the oil mill blew and we feared that it was a signal that had been agreed upon to alarm the town in case we were observed but we were not molested
a spent bullet did hit me on the crazy bone and as i was leading bobs horse it caused a little excitement for a minute but that was all
howard and woods who had favored killing dunning and who felt we were losing valuable time because of bobs wound left us that night and went west
dont shoot him or ill shoot you
finally we administered to him an oath not to betray our whereabouts until we had time to make our escape and he agreed not to
then came the talk of mob vengeance we had heard so often in missouri
saturday morning we left our horses and started through on foot hiding that day on an island in a swamp
and sheriff glispins order not to shoot was the beginning of the protectorate that minnesota people established over us
all of us but bob had gone down at the first fire
forming in line four paces apart he ordered them to advance rapidly and concentrate the fire of the whole line the instant the robbers were discovered
a little way out of northfield we met a farmer and borrowed one of his horses for pitts to ride
next day he rose and prayed the dawn prayer and repaired to his namesakes house where after the company was all assembled the host began to relate
lastly i lashed a piece of wood on either side to serve me as oars and launched it and embarking did according to the saying of the poet
then he bestowed on me great riches from his treasuries and charged me with a magnificent present for the caliph harun al rashid
then i loaded it with the goods precious ores and jewels and the union pearls which were like gravel and the best of the ambergris crude and pure together with what i had collected on the island and what was left me of victual and wild herbs
one day the king himself asked me of the fashions and form of government of my country and i acquainted him with the circumstance of the caliphs sway in the city of baghdad and the justice of his rule
so we besought the almighty and called for succour upon his apostle on whom be blessing and peace when suddenly a violent squall of wind arose and smote the ship which rose out of the water and settled upon a great reef the haunt of sea monsters where it broke up and fell asunder into planks and all and everything on board were plunged into the sea
when they saw i understood them not and made them no answer one of them came forward and said to me in arabic peace be with thee o my brother
for state processions a throne is set for him upon a huge elephant eleven cubits high and upon this he sitteth having his great lords and officers and guests standing in two ranks on his right hand and on his left
we sailed with a fair wind committing ourselves to the care of allah be he extolled and exalted and by his permission arrived at bassorah where i passed a few days and nights equipping myself and packing up my bales
moreover he gave me a sealed letter saying carry this with thine own hand to the commander of the faithful and give him many salutations from us hearing and obedience i replied
when it was the five hundred and sixty second night
so we covered the bales with our cloaks and garments and drugget and canvas lest they be spoiled by the rain and betook ourselves to prayer and supplication to almighty allah and humbled ourselves before him for deliverance from the peril that was upon us
then i took leave of him and of all my intimates and acquaintances in the island and embarked with the merchants aforesaid
when it was the five hundred and sixty third night
she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when sindbad the seaman had related the history of what befel him in his sixth voyage and all the company had dispersed sindbad the landsman went home and slept as of wont
as for me i tore off all my clothes but my gown and swam a little way till i happened upon one of the ships planks whereto i clung and bestrode it like a horse whilst the winds and the waters sported with me and the waves carried me up and cast me down and i was in most piteous plight for fear and distress and hunger and thirst
presently we heard a terrible great cry like the loud pealing thunder whereat we were terror struck and became as dead men giving ourselves up for lost
when it was the five hundred and sixty first night
so i consorted with the chief of the islanders and they paid me the utmost respect
my boat raft drifted with the stream i pondering the issue of my affair and the drifting ceased not till i came to the place where it disappeared beneath the mountain
then he conferred on me exceeding great favours and i repaired to my quarter and entered my home where i warehoused all my goods and possessions presently my friends came to me and i distributed presents among my family and gave alms and largesse after which i yielded myself to joyance and enjoyment mirth and merry making and forgot all that i had suffered
who are ye and what country is this o my brother answered he we are husbandmen and tillers of the soil who came out to water our fields and plantations and finding thee asleep on this raft laid hold of it and made it fast by us against thou shouldst awake at thy leisure
the seventh voyage of sindbad the seaman
but i was delighted at my escape from the river

its this ere nasty boot as makes me tired said dickie
now write what i say mr

at last he said youre a sharp lad you arebloomin sharp
when it was over the man asked dickie if he could walk a little way and when dickie said he could they set out in the most friendly way side by side

a real live bird
a bird paused in its flight on a branch quite close and clung there swaying
dickie explained

dickie left the shop without his moonflowers indeed but with his tinkler now whitely shining and declared to be real silver and mind you take care of it my lad his white cornelian seal carefully packed in a strong little cardboard box with metal corners
now were square he said
mr beale looked at him through the deepening twilightrather queerly dickie thought
he was very pleased with himself for having been so kind
no said dickie
look the suns just going
in the hospital you were almost too clean and you didnt do it yourself
dickie thought of the kitchen at home the lamp that smoked the dirty table the fender full of ashes and dirty paper the dry bread that tasted of mice and the water out of the broken earthenware cup
that would be his breakfast when he had gone to bed crying after his aunt had slapped him
it was over trees more beautiful than anything dickie had ever seen for they were now in a country road with green hedges and green grass growing beside it in which little round faced flowers grewdaisies they wereeven dickie knew that
i want company
it was a very long time indeed before he came back
you ave that said dickie
here we are said the man
some blokes dont but i do
come along down cant you
he reward the wake the last of the english and i wunnered what it stood for
you can keep to the grass

i see that there in a book said dickie charmed
there was a loose board in his room where the man saw to the gas
well you come alonger me

and dont you forget youre my nipper and you got to call me daddy

i know you will said dickie with enthusiasm
just a tiddy bit praps said dickie bravely but i can stick it
some blokes think it pays to be dirty
it almost looked dickie thought as though he had brought them out for some special purpose
andhere we are said mr beale stopping in a side street at an open door from which yellow light streamed welcomingly
ever been on the boat
yes said dickie if i got a pen
all the way pretty near said the man
so you shall said mr beale a regler wash all overthis very night
to the people who live in rosemary terrace the words police court are very alarming indeed
bless me said mr beale uncomfortably
that made all the difference
is this deptford dickie asked
whatme said dickie
i should think so
he looked about him and knew that he did not at all know where he was there was a tall thin ragged man lounging against a stable door in the yard where the punch and judy show lived
id best be getting home
he longed to see it unpack itself and display its wonders and he followed it through more streets than he knew and when he found that it was not going to unpack at all but was just going home to its bed in an old coach house he remembered the fire wood and the halfpenny clutched tight and close in his hand seemed to reproach him warmly
a thousand blessings from a grateful heart
the sun shot long golden beams through the gaps in the hedge
and dont you forget it
ave you been asleep
is it country where you going said dickie looking at the green hedge
take it or leave it
the wind blew freshly and the ragged man found a sheltered corner behind the funnel
i like it very much and thank you kindly said dickie presently
oh yes
butwell be beggars you mean he said doubtfully
not exackly said the man but its all right
so now i make you a fair offer
no said dickie
dickie felt that this was true
it was so sheltered and the wind had been so strong that dickie felt sleepy
tramping alone aint no beano to me
i will come back
also he sighed heavily
what call you got to do it
only i calls her that
fried eggs and baconhe had one egg and the man had threebread and butterand if the bread was thick so was the butterand as many cups of tea as you liked to say thank you for
he had never seen one before and it interested him extremely
she any good
he rolled over took the paper and read it slowly and with difficulty then he folded it and put it in his pocket
why not
oh nono i never
i shall catch it a fair treat as it is
dickie always remembered that moment
mother
what do you say matey
im going that way myself said the man getting away from the wall well go back by the boat if you like
then he looked up at the sky and then down at the roadthey were resting on a heap of stones
also a broken backed copy of ingoldsby legends and one of mrs markhams english history which had no back at all
its pavements were of red brick and its houses of white stone and its bow windows and balconies were green and dickie thought it was the prettiest town in the world
mr beale looked down at the touch
gets is own meals and larks about on is own
how beautiful said dickie wriggling with delight
then does it hurt youwalking
by evening they had seven and sixpence
its bettern fiff of november said dickie and i do like you
yes course they must ave come to think of it
see that bloke just now said mr beale
mr beale laughed
yes isnt he mother said the little girl
remember that neither of them knew any better
and dickie for the first time slept out of doors
only howls and rats lives in ruins
thats all you know
and to ear the way e does the patter to me on the road
its got loose said dickie trying to scramble out of the perambulator lets catch im and take im along
have you ever slept out of doors
id like to be a rabbit
it was a wonderful day
she died in the infirmary
dickie quick to imitate touched his
poor little man said the lady you miss your mother dont you
might a passed im in a crowdsee
mr beale went more and more slowly and as the lady and the little girl drew near he stopped altogether and touched his cap
no nobody dont live ere mate said mr beale
youre a kind father said the lady
theyre only weeds said beale
i shouldnt wonder said mr beale indifferently
see
dickie sniffed
i never knew you took like it afore
its a ruin this is
then he said
he laid in bed and heard jolly voices talking and singing in the kitchen below
they did not stay there but walked out across the downs where the skylarks were singing and on a dip of the downs came upon great stone walls and towers very strong and gray
couldnt get a nipper
but you said the bed with the green curtains urged dickie
is it a king as lives ere then dickie asked
dickie saw and the crown was set on his happiness
but es never let it out
come on mate
from some mysterious source mr beale had obtained an old double perambulator which must have been made dickie thought for very fat twins it was so broad and roomy
did any one ever live in it
i got the plan drawed out
and that pillowy bundle on the seat
a rabbit
to the elder tramp lies and begging were natural means of livelihood
three months ago it was mum
you much better be my little nipper said beale
whats that there said dickie
burglars
seems to me youre a bit dotty about this ere extry double nipper
well prhaps youre right
to the little tramp the whole thing was a new and entrancing game of make believe
but if youve got silver you oughtnt to be begging said the lady shutting up her purse
it was not the next day which was a saturday that they took the train like dukes
like the ones that his fancy had put in the mouldering hutch at home
blessed if i ever see such a nipper he said over and over again
in you gets he said suddenly youll be fair knocked
never see such a nipper for noticing neither
i like you nexter my own daddy and mr baxter next door
hi there goes a rabbit
please do not be too shocked
thats all right said mr beale awkwardly
you can look about you just as well a sittin down he added laying the crutch across the front of the perambulator
then he spat thoughtfully
but you learned all that at school
the night is full of interesting little sounds that will not at first let you sleepthe rustle of little wild things in the hedges the barking of dogs in distant farms the chirp of crickets and the croaking of frogs
all the country sights and sounds that you hardly notice because you have known them every year as long as you can remember were wonderful magic to the little boy from deptford
es a wunner and no bloomin error
its a carstlelike wot the kings got at windsor
swelp me he said helplessly
next morning quite early they took the road
when dickie came back without mushrooms the red whiskered man was gone
a bit of all right i call it
they went on up the hill as happy as any one need wish to be
not like it did fore i went to the orspittle
see him
thats our clothes
the best emetic is that which is at hand
to avert the tendency to death we must endeavour to palliate the symptoms and neutralize the effects of the poison
eightdetection of poisons
filter through a filter moistened with water
evaporate filtrate to dryness and dissolve residue in water the solution being made distinctly acid
every doctor should provide himself with an antidote case
seventreatment of poisoning
the tube should be examined to see that it is not broken or cracked as accidents have happened from neglecting this precaution
in the case of phosphorus the condenser should be of glass and the process of distillation conducted in the dark so that the luminosity of the phosphorus may be noted
the ether floats on the surface holding the alkaloids except morphine in solution five a part of this ethereal solution is poured into a watch glass and allowed to evaporate
it may be given in the form of the injection of the pharmacopoeia or preferably as a tablet dissolved in water
if the medical practitioner is in doubt on any point he should obtain technical assistance from someone who has paid attention to the subject
notice the smell colour and general appearance of the matter submitted for examination
tickling the fauces with a feather may excite vomiting
the various antidotes will be mentioned under their respective poisons
the filtrate is shaken with ether to remove fat etc the ether separated the watery solution neutralized with soda and then shaken with ether which removes the alkaloid in a more or less impure condition
he should make inquiries as to symptoms and time at which food or medicine was last taken
the dose for an adult is ten minims
if there is a choice give apomorphine hypodermically
he would be unwise to do so
in order to isolate an inorganic substance from organic matter freseniuss method is adopted
in using the elastic stomach tube some fluid should be introduced into the stomach before attempting to empty it or a portion of the mucous membrane may be sucked into the aperture
to purify it add a small quantity of dilute sulphuric acid and after evaporating to three quarters of its bulk add a saturated solution of carbonate of potash or soda
the modes of treatment may be ranged under three heads one to eliminate the poison two to antagonize its action three to avert the tendency to death
this examination having been made the contents of the alimentary canal and any other substances to be examined must be submitted to chemical processes
the flask is heated in a water bath and the vapours condensed by a liebigs condenser
in making a post mortem examination the alimentary canal should be removed and preserved for further investigation
a double ligature should be passed round the oesophagus and also round the duodenum a few inches below the pylorus
on the evaporation of the alcohol the resinous and fatty matters separate
in the absence of a hypodermic syringe the remedy may be given by the rectum
in the case of narcotics and depressing agents stimulants electricity and cold affusions may be found useful
make a solution of the contents of the stomach or solid organs minced very fine by digesting them with acidulated alcohol or water and filtering
he should take possession of any food medicine vomited matter urine or faeces in the room and should seal them up in clean vessels for examination
the residue of the material after digestion with hydrochloric acid and potassium chlorate may have to be examined for silver lead and barium
evaporate the filtrate to a syrup and extract with successive portions of absolute alcohol
absolute alcohol will then dissolve out the alkaloid and leave it on evaporation in a crystalline form
treat this with excess of bisulphate of sodium then saturate with sulphuretted hydrogen until metals are thrown down as sulphides these may be collected and tested
in the case of volatile substances distillation will be required
he should notice the position and temperature of the body the condition of rigor mortis marks of violence appearance of lips and mouth
if the alkaloid is volatile oily streaks appear on the glass if not volatile crystalline traces will be visible
all observations should be at once committed to writing or they will not be admitted by the court for the purpose of refreshing the memory whilst giving evidence
seeds of plants may be found
these should all be put in separate jars without any preservative fluid tied up sealed labelled and initialled
separate the ethereal solution and evaporate
the second indication is met by the administration of the appropriate antidote
in a case of attempted suicide by poisoning is it the duty of the doctor to inform the police
he had much better stick to his own business and not act as an amateur detective
the first indication is met by the administration of emetics to produce vomiting or by the application of the stomach tube
simple filtration will sometimes suffice to separate the required substance in other cases dialysis will be necessary in order that crystalloid substances may be separated from colloid bodies
the intestines may be removed in a similar way and the whole or a portion of the liver should be preserved
apomorphine is not allied in physiological action to morphine and may be given in cases of narcotic poisoning sulphate of zinc salt and water ipecacuanha and mustard are all useful as emetics
the colour may indicate salts of copper cantharides etc
the odour may show the presence of prussic acid alcohol opium or phosphorus
we should endeavour to promote the elimination of the poison from the body by stimulating the secretions
antidotes may act one chemically by forming harmless compounds as lime in oxalic acid poisoning two physiologically the drug which is administered neutralizing more or less completely the poison which has been absorbed three physically as charcoal
when the father who begat the world saw the image which he had made of the eternal gods moving and living he rejoiced and in his joy resolved since the archetype was eternal to make the creature eternal as far as this was possible
do ye therefore make them i will implant in them the seed of immortality and you shall weave together the mortal and immortal and provide food for them and receive them again in death thus he spake and poured the remains of the elements into the cup in which he had mingled the soul of the universe
socrates begins the timaeus with a summary of the republic
he put the moon in the orbit which was nearest to the earth the sun in that next the morning star and mercury in the orbits which move opposite to the sun but with equal swiftnessthis being the reason why they overtake and are overtaken by one another
the fires from within and from without meet about the smooth and bright surface of the mirror and because they meet in a manner contrary to the usual mode the right and left sides of the object are transposed
and god created them according to the patterns or species of them which existed in the divine original
now the nile is our saviour from fire and as there is little rain in egypt we are not harmed by water whereas in other countries when a deluge comes the inhabitants are swept by the rivers into the sea
the soul was first made by himthe elder to rule the younger not in the order in which our wayward fancy has led us to describe them but the soul first and afterwards the body
and when external impressions enter in they are really conquered though they seem to conquer
and god lighted a fire in the second orbit from the earth which is called the sun to give light over the whole heaven and to teach intelligent beings that knowledge of number which is derived from the revolution of the same
the fire or light when kept in by the eyelids equalizes the inward motions and there is rest accompanied by few dreams only when the greater motions remain they engender in us corresponding visions of the night
the old man brightened up at hearing this and said had solon only had the leisure which was required to complete the famous legend which he brought with him from egypt he would have been as distinguished as homer and hesiod
of the second or concurrent causes of sight i have already spoken and i will now speak of the higher purpose of god in giving us eyes
the outer circle or sphere was named the sphere of the samethe inner the sphere of the other or diverse and the one revolved horizontally to the right the other diagonally to the left
by reason of these affections the soul is at first without intelligence but as time goes on the stream of nutriment abates and the courses of the soul regain their proper motion and apprehend the same and the other rightly and become rational
critias when he told this tale of the olden time was ninety years old i being not more than ten
two kinds of motion were assigned to themfirst the revolution in the same and around the same in peaceful unchanging thought of the same and to this was added a forward motion which was under the control of the same
i will briefly describe them to you and you shall read the account of them at your leisure in the sacred registers
for there occurs at long intervals a derangement of the heavenly bodies and then the earth is destroyed by fire
all that he did was done rationally in and by himself and he moved in a circle turning within himself which is the most intellectual of motions but the other six motions were wanting to him wherefore the universe had no feet or legs
in the likeness of what animal was the world madethat is the third questionthe form of the perfect animal was a whole and contained all intelligible beings and the visible animal made after the pattern of this included all visible creatures
he lightly touches upon a few pointsthe division of labour and distribution of the citizens into classes the double nature and training of the guardians the community of property and of women and children
these swelling and surging as in a river moved irregularly and irrationally in all the six possible ways forwards backwards right left up and down
the body of heaven is visible but the soul is invisible and partakes of reason and harmony and is the best of creations being the work of the best
and what was the subject of the poem said the person who made the remark
timaeus why did the creator make the worldhe was good and therefore not jealous and being free from jealousy he desired that all things should be like himself
god gave us the faculty of sight that we might behold the order of the heavens and create a corresponding order in our own erring minds
are there many worlds or one onlythat is the fourth questionone only
having made a compound of all the three he proceeded to divide the entire mass into portions related to one another in the ratios of one two three four nine eight twenty seven and proceeded to fill up the double and triple intervals thus
there are four of them one of gods another of birds a third of fishes and a fourth of animals
a little while afterwards there were great earthquakes and floods and your warrior race all sank into the earth and the great island of atlantis also disappeared in the sea
the spot of earth which the goddess chose had the best of climates and produced the wisest men in no other was she herself the philosopher and warrior goddess so likely to have votaries
nine thousand years have elapsed since she founded yours and eight thousand since she founded ours as our annals record
vain would be the labour of telling all the figures of them moving as in dance and their juxta positions and approximations and when and where and behind what other stars they appear to disappearto tell of all this without looking at a plan of them would be labour in vain
the sight of them and their revolutions has given us the knowledge of number and time the power of enquiry and philosophy which is the great blessing of human life not to speak of the lesser benefits which even the vulgar can appreciate
but violent as were the internal and alimentary fluids the tide became still more violent when the body came into contact with flaming fire or the solid earth or gliding waters or the stormy wind the motions produced by these impulses pass through the body to the soul and have the name of sensations
then your city did bravely and won renown over the whole earth
socrates excellent timaeus i like your manner of approaching the subjectproceed
thus arose day and night which are the periods of the most intelligent nature a month is created by the revolution of the moon a year by that of the sun
the occasion of the rehearsal was the day of the apaturia called the registration of youth at which our parents gave prizes for recitation
but in egypt the traditions of our own and other lands are by us registered for ever in our temples
the subject was a very noble one he described the most famous action in which the athenian people were ever engaged
and as the world was composed of solids between the elements of fire and earth god placed two other elements of air and water and arranged them in a continuous proportion
although they give no proof we must believe them as is customary
but i would not speak at the time because i wanted to refresh my memory i had heard the old man when i was a child and though i could not remember the whole of our yesterdays discourse i was able to recall every word of this which is branded into my mind and i am prepared socrates to rehearse to you the entire narrative
now he who is the best could only create the fairest and reflecting that of visible things the intelligent is superior to the unintelligent he put intelligence in soul and soul in body and framed the universe to be the best and fairest work in the order of nature and the world became a living soul through the providence of god
that which is bound may be dissolved but only an evil being would dissolve that which is harmonious and happy
the memory of them was lost because there was no written voice among you
i see replied socrates that i shall be well entertained and do you timaeus offer up a prayer and begin
the earth which is our nurse clinging around the pole extended through the universe he made to be the guardian and artificer of night and day first and eldest of gods that are in the interior of heaven
but he is unable to invent such a narrative himself and he is afraid that the poets are equally incapable for although he pretends to have nothing to say against them he remarks that they are a tribe of imitators who can only describe what they have seen
sight is the source of the greatest benefits to us for if our eyes had never seen the sun stars and heavens the words which we have spoken would not have been uttered
thus was time made in the image of the eternal nature and it was created together with the heavens in order that if they were dissolved it might perish with them
and something similar happens when the disordered motions of the soul come into contact with any external thing they say the same or the other in a manner which is the very opposite of the truth and they are false and foolish and have no guiding principle in them
other periods of wonderful length and complexity are not observed by men in general there is moreover a cycle or perfect year at the completion of which they all meet and coincideto this end the stars came into being that the created heaven might imitate the eternal nature
and there you dwelt as became the children of the gods excelling all men in virtue and many famous actions are recorded of you
now that which is created is of necessity corporeal and visible and tangiblevisible and therefore made of firetangible and therefore solid and made of earth
for if in the original there had been more than one they would have been the parts of a third which would have been the true pattern of the world and therefore there is and will ever be but one created world
thus far the universal animal was made in the divine image but the other animals were not as yet included in him
this however is an after stageat present we are only concerned with the creation of the body and soul
the most famous of them all was the overthrow of the island of atlantis
but when the visual ray goes forth into the darkness then unlike falls upon unlikethe eye no longer sees and we go to sleep
and his children receiving from him the immortal principle borrowed from the world portions of earth air fire water hereafter to be returned which they fastened together not with the adamantine bonds which bound themselves but by little invisible pegs making each separate body out of all the elements subject to influx and efflux and containing the courses of the soul
perceiving this and with the view of eliciting information from them he told them the tales of phoroneus and niobe and also of deucalion and pyrrha and he endeavoured to count the generations which had since passed
all these bodies became living creatures and learnt their appointed tasks and began to move the nearer more swiftly the remoter more slowly according to the diagonal movement of the other
the entire compound was divided by him lengthways into two parts which he united at the centre like the letter x and bent into an inner and outer circle or sphere cutting one another again at a point over against the point at which they cross
what is spoken of the unchanging or intelligible must be certain and true but what is spoken of the created image can only be probable being is to becoming what truth is to belief
the two divine courses were encased by the gods in a sphere which is called the head and is the god and lord of us
and since this was controlled by the movement of the same the seven planets in their courses appeared to describe spirals and that appeared fastest which was slowest and that which overtook others appeared to be overtaken by them
and although you are not immortal you shall not die for i will hold you together
god took of the unchangeable and indivisible and also of the divisible and corporeal and out of the two he made a third nature essence which was in a mean between them and partook of the same and the other the intractable nature of the other being compressed into the same
and so the thought of god made a god in the image of a perfect body having intercourse with himself and needing no other but in every part harmonious and selfcontained and truly blessed
they were no longer pure as before but diluted and the mixture he distributed into souls equal in number to the stars and assigned each to a starthen having mounted them as in a chariot he showed them the nature of the universe and told them of their future birth and human lot
the souls were to be implanted in bodies which were in a perpetual flux whence he said would arise first sensation secondly love which is a mixture of pleasure and pain thirdly fear and anger and the opposite affections and if they conquered these they would live righteously but if they were conquered by them unrighteously
this great island lay over against the pillars of heracles in extent greater than libya and asia put together and was the passage to other islands and to a great ocean of which the mediterranean sea was only the harbour and within the pillars the empire of atlantis reached in europe to tyrrhenia and in libya to egypt
when all of them both those who show themselves in the sky and those who retire from view had come into being the creator addressed them thusgods sons of gods my works if i will are indissoluble
this mighty power was arrayed against egypt and hellas and all the countries bordering on the mediterranean
the gods were made in the form of a circle which is the most perfect figure and the figure of the universe they were created chiefly of fire that they might be bright and were made to know and follow the best and to be scattered over the heavens of which they were to be the glory
and so put together a visible and palpable heaven having harmony and friendship in the union of the four elements and being at unity with itself it was indissoluble except by the hand of the framer
in mind replied the priest i mean to say that you are children there is no opinion or tradition of knowledge among you which is white with age and i will tell you why
hear me thenthree tribes of mortal beings have still to be created but if created by me they would be like gods
but two terms must be united by a third which is a mean between them and had the earth been a surface only one mean would have sufficed but two means are required to unite solid bodies
the soul of him who has education is whole and perfect and escapes the worst disease but if a mans education be neglected he walks lamely through life and returns good for nothing to the world below
wherefore he made an image of eternity which is time having an uniform motion according to number parted into months and days and years and also having greater divisions of past present and future
is the world created or uncreatedthat is the first question
they first contrived the eyes into which they conveyed a light akin to the light of day making it flow through the pupils
look
look
i have no heavenly father
hush pearl hush
child what art thou cried the mother
or if not thou strange and elfish child whence didst thou come
it is thou that must tell me
but look here at carpaccio even in my copy
there are just four touchesfine as the finest penmanshipto do that beak and yet you will find that in the peculiar paroquettish mumbling and nibbling action of it and all the character in which this nibbling beak differs from the tearing beak of the eagle it is impossible to go farther or be more precise
but in this vignette copied from turner you have the two principles brought out perfectly
of course i cannot do so myself yet in these sketches of mine made for the sake of color there is enough to show you the nature and the value of the method they are two pieces of study of the color of marble architecture the tints literally edified and laid edge to edge as simply on the paper as the stones are on the walls
some of the touches indeed when the tint has been mixed with much water have been laid in little drops or ponds so that the pigment might crystallize hard at the edge
he knows them both
but this peacock being drawn with intense delight in blue on gold and getting character of peacock in the general sharp outline instead ofas rubens peacocksin black shadow is distinctively gothic of fine style
our uneducated men work too bluntly to be ever in the right but the germans draw finely and resolutely wrong
but if you go on into the veracities of the school of clay you will find there is something at the roots of almond and apple trees which isthis
now in this of burne jones the landscape is clearly full of light everywhere color or glass light that is the outline is prepared for modification of color only
in both these high mythical subjects the surrounding nature though suffering is still dignified and beautiful
so that the schools of crystal visionary passionate and fantastic in purpose are in method trenchantly formal and clear and the schools of clay absolutely realistic temperate and simple in purpose are in method mysterious and soft sometimes licentious sometimes terrific and always obscure
do not therefore think that the gothic school is an easy one
i wish you therefore to begin your study of natural history and landscape by discerning the simple outlines and the pleasant colors of things and to rest in them as long as you can
so that if you get once the right clue to any group of them it will grasp the simplest yet reach to the highest truths
and also carpaccio does it with a touch with one sweep of his brush three minutes at the most allowed for all the beast while michael angelo has been haggling at this dragons neck for an hour
it has no beauty whatsoever no specialty of picturesqueness and all its lines are cramped and poor
the other is a mythological subject of deeper meaning the death of procris
you have the white of foaming water of buildings and clouds brought out brilliantly from a white ground and though part of the subject is in deep shadow the eye at once catches the one black point admitted in front
by being studious of color they are studious of division and while the chiaroscurist devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thingunseparated light the colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light
this is no longer to make us think of the death of happy souls but of the labor of unhappy ones at least of the more or less limited dullest andi must not say homely butunhomely life of the neglected agricultural poor
in both the vegetation though beautiful is absolutely wild and uncared for as it seems either by human or by higher powers which having appointed for it the laws of its being leave it to spring into such beauty as is consistent with disease and alternate with decay
then he comes to the beak of it
none of this bright gothic art was ever done but either by faith in the attainableness of felicity in heaven or under conditions of real order and delicate loveliness on the earth
every plant in the grass is set formally grows perfectly and may be realized completely
and here i am able to show you fortunately one of his works painted at this time of his most earnest thought when his imagination was still freshly filled with the greek mythology and he saw for the first time with his own eyes the clouds come down upon the actual earth
thus in chaucers dream
but there exist some exquisite though feebler designs in missal painting of which in england the landscape and flowers in the psalter of henry the sixth will serve you for a sufficient type the landscape in the grimani missal at venice being monumentally typical and perfect
once understand that and you will see why turner has put her death under this deep shade of trees the sun withdrawing his last ray and why he has put beside her the low type of an animals pain a dog licking its wounded paw
you see how doubly how intimately opposed the ideas are yet how difficult to explain without apparent contradiction
nothing will be more precious to you i think in the practical study of art than the conviction which will force itself on you more and more every hour of the way all things are bound together little and great in spirit and in matter
you might more easily fill a house with pictures like constables from garret to cellar than imitate one cluster of leaves by van eyck or giotto and among all the efforts that have been made to paint our common wild flowers i have only onceand that in this very year just in time to show it to youseen the thing done rightly
now for your own practice in this having first acquired the skill of exquisite delineation and laying of pure color day by day you must draw some lovely natural form or flower or animal without obscurityas in missal painting choosing for study in natural scenes only what is beautiful and strong in life
you must look at him in the facefight himconquer him with what scathe you may you need not think to keep out of the way of him
three
i say whether color be gay or sad
and therefore primarily they must be able to divide so that elementary exercises in color must be directed like first exercises in music to the clear separation of notes and the final perfections of color are those in which of innumerable notes or hues every one has a distinct office and can be fastened on by the eye and approved as fulfilling it
i just now referred to the landscape by john bellini in the national gallery as one of the six best existing of the purist school being wholly felicitous and enjoyable
my first and principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance on any student who might attempt to copy them this method of laying portions of distinct hue side by side
only there are two sorts of cloud and fire
well then last here is turners greek school of the highest class and you define his art absolutely as first the displaying intensely and with the sternest intellect of natural form as it is and then the envelopment of it with cloud and fire
and one of the chief delights which any one who really enjoys painting finds in that art as distinct from sculpture is in this exquisite inlaying or joiners work of it the fitting of edge to edge with a manual skill precisely correspondent to the close application of crowded notes without the least slur in fine harp or piano playing
again there is not a touch of black in any shadow however deep of these two studies so that if i chose to put a piece of black near them it would be conspicuous with a vengeance
i fully anticipated at the beginning of the pre raphaelite movement that they would have carried forward this method of work but they broke themselves to pieces by pursuing dramatic sensation instead of beauty
george of carpaccio at venice are all that i can name myself of great works
the brown ground beneath is left for the most part one touch of black is put for the hollow two delicate lines of dark gray define the outer curve and one little quivering touch of white draws the inner edge of the mandible
but observe you can only do this on one conditionthat of striving also to create in reality the beauty which you seek in imagination
in a few moments to lose her forever
we have no language sufficiently strong for the expression of our indignation and shame at the recent transaction in a sister state and that state missouri a state of which we had long been proud alike for her men and history but now so fallen that we could wish her star stricken from the bright constellation of the union
was it the mormons is it not notorious on the contrary that they were hunted like wild beasts from county to county before they made any resistance
there their sad condition evoked for a time general commiseration
the first well established seat of the church was in the pretty little town of kirtland ohio almost within sight of lake erie and here soon rose the first temple of modern times
no respect was paid to age or sex grey heads and infant lips that scarcely had learned to lisp a word vigorous manhood and immature youth mother and maiden fared alike in the scene of carnage and their bodies were thrown into an old well
the national executive andrew jackson while expressing sympathy for the persecuted people deplored his lack of power to interfere with the administration or non administration of state laws the national officials could do nothing the state officials would do naught
within two years of its dedication the temple in kirtland was abandoned by the people who were compelled to flee for their lives before the onslaughts of mobocrats but a second temple larger and more beautiful than the first soon reared its spires in the city of nauvoo illinois
their gathering is to be like that of the jews at jerusalema pacific one and in their taking possession of what they regard as a land of promise no one previously located there shall be denied his rights
their eyes were from the first turned in anticipation toward the evening sunnot merely that the work of proselyting should be carried on in the west but that the headquarters of the church should be there established
but tools were not wanting as indeed they never have been for murder and its kindred outrages
an appeal was made to the executive of the state but little encouragement was returned
let us observe the contrast between the beginning and the present proportions of the church
american school boys read with emotions of horror of the albigenses driven beaten and killed with a papal legate directing the butchery and of the vaudois hunted and hounded like beasts as the effect of a royal decree and they yet shall read in the history of their own country of scenes as terrible as these in the exhibition of injustice and inhuman hate
at first but a family affair opposition to the work has involved successively the town the county the state the country and today the mormon question has been accorded extended consideration at the hands of the national government and indeed most civilized nations have taken cognizance of the same
have any who plundered and openly insulted the mormons ever been brought to the punishment due to their crimes let boasting murderers of begging and helpless infancy answer
at that time there may have been and probably were many times that number who had professed adherence to the newly restored faith but as the requirements of the law governing the formation of religious societies were satisfied by the application of six only the specified number formally took part such was the beginning of the church soon to be so universally maligned
nevertheless the mustard seed among the smallest of all seeds has attained the proportions of a tree and the birds of the air are nesting in its branches the acorn is now an oak offering protection and the sweets of satisfaction to every earnest pilgrim journeying its way for truth
its origin was smalla germ an insignificant seed hardly to be thought of as likely to arouse opposition
oh what a record to read what a picture to gaze upon how awful the fact an official edict offering expatriation or death to a peaceable community with no crime proved against them and guilty of no offense other than that of choosing to differ in opinion from the masses
who began the quarrel
the awful work was carried out with dread dispatch
what the heart of man can conceive the hand of man will find a way to execute
already a north and a south were talked ofwhy not set up also a west
he was a man with clear title as one of the small brotherhood we call great
with his death closed another epoch in the history of his people and a successor arose one who was capable of leading and judging under the changed conditions
and what was the cause of this hurried departure of the military for many months ominous rumblings had been heardindications of the gathering storm which was soon to break in the awful fury of civil strife
the people contested these measures one by one in the courts presenting in case after case the different phases of the subject and urging the unconstitutionality of the measure
but mormonism died not every added pang of grief served but to unite the people
he left utah in the early stages of the rebellion turned his arms against the flag he had sworn to defend doffed the blue donned the grey and fell a rebel on the field of shiloh
at last the edmunds tucker act took effect making not the marriage alone but the subsequent acknowledging of the contract an offense punishable by fine or imprisonment or both
sad as have been the experiences of the people in consequence of this practise deep and anguish laden as have been the sighs and groans hot and bitter as have been the tears so caused the heaviest persecution the cruelest treatment of their history began before plural marriage was known in the church
we believe further that contracts as of marriage to be valid beyond the veil of mortality must be sanctioned by a power greater than that of earth
the movement has been called not inaptly buchanans blunder but the best and wisest men may make blunders and whatever may be said of president buchanans short sightedness in taking this step even his enemies do not question his integrity in the matter
the latter day saints were long regarded as a polygamous people
at the inception of plural marriage among the latter day saints there was no law national or state against its practise
changes many and great followed in bewildering succession in utah
but a word further concerning the expedition in general
a supreme opportunity had come and how was it used
the people were besought to take sides with the south in the awful scenes of cruel strife it was openly stated in the east that utah had allied herself with the cause of secession and by others that the design was to make salt lake city the capital of an independent government
we believe in a literal resurrection and an actual hereafter in which future state shall be recognized every sanctified and authorized relationship existing here on earthof parent and child brother and sister husband and wife
to them marriage is not can never be a civil compact alone its significance reaches beyond the grave its obligations are eternal and the latter day saints are notable for the sanctity with which they invest the marital state
in whatever light this practise has been regarded in the past it is today a dead issue forbidden by ecclesiastical rule as it is prohibited by legal statute
he was unjustly charged with favoring secession but the charge was soon disproved
but the people have suspended the practise of plural marriage and the testimony of the governors judges and district attorneys of the territory and later that of the officers of the state have declared the sincerity of the renunciation
yet the two have often been confused in the popular mind
but let us turn more particularly to the history of the church itself
it could not be doubted that war was imminent already the conflict had begun and a picked part of the army was away in the western wilds doing nothing for any phase of the public good
with the seal of the holy priesthood upon their wedded state these people believe implicitly in the perpetuity of that relationship on the far side of the grave
however it was known that certain of his cabinet were in league with the seceding states and prominent among them was john floyd secretary of war
when the history of that great struggle with its antecedent and its consequent circumstances is written with a pen that shall indite naught but truth when prejudice and partisanship are lived down it may appear that jefferson davis rather than james buchanan was the prime cause of the great mistake
and the world is learning to its manifest surprise that plural marriage and mormonism are not synonymous terms
federal judges and united states attorneys in utah who were not mormons nor lovers of mormonism refused to entertain complaints or prosecute cases under the law because of its manifest injustice and inadequacy but other laws followed most of which as the latter day saints believe were aimed directly at their religious conception of the marriage contract and not at social impropriety nor sexual offense
today the church of jesus christ of latter day saints is stronger than ever before and the people are confident that it is at its weakest stage for all time to come
as the people had adopted the practise under what was believed to be divine approval they suspended it when they were justified in so doing
the mormon people saw in their terrible experiences and in the outrages to which they had been subjected only the mal administration of laws and the subversion of justice through human incapacity and hatred
the troops once in utah had to be provisioned and everything the settlers could spare was eagerly bought at an unusual price the gold changed hands
it is also told how at the commencement of the rebellion he allied himself with the confederate forces accepting the rank of brigadier general it was through floyds advice that buchanan ordered the military expedition to utah ostensibly to install certain federal officials and to repress an alleged infantile rebellion which in fact had never come into existence but in reality to further the interests of the secessionists
the army found the people in poverty and left them in comparative wealth
its creed provides for the protection of all men in their rights of worship according to the dictates of conscience
this statement assumes as granted a distinction between bigamy and the mormon institution of plural marriage
the successful efforts of this officer to disarm the north while accumulating the munitions of war in the south to scatter the forces by locating them in widely separated and remote stations and in other ways to dispose of the regular army in the manner best calculated to favor the anticipated rebellion are matters of history
in eighteen sixty two a law was enacted with the purpose of suppressing plural marriage and as had been predicted in the national senate prior to its passage it lay for many years a dead letter
but perhaps i am suspected of having forgotten or of having intentionally omitted reference to what popular belief once considered the chief feature of mormonism the cornerstone of the structure the secret of its influence over its members and of its attractiveness to its proselytes viz the peculiarity of the mormon institution of marriage
and surely such conjectures were pardonable on the part of all whose ignorance and prejudice still nursed the delusion of mormon disloyalty moreover had the people been inclined to rebellion what greater opportunity could they have wished
after all the mormon people regard the advent of the buchanan army as one of the greatest material blessings ever brought to them
and so the story of mormonism runs on its finale has not yet been written the current press presents continuously new stages of its progress new developments of its plan
then in their hasty departure the soldiers disposed of everything outside of actual necessities in the way of accouterment and camp equipage
it is possible that i may be in a position then to indicate some course of action
you will see that i have said i have determined not to go in for the examination
i should like to have a peep at each of them said holmes
you observe that the scratch on that table is slight at one side but deepens in the direction of the bedroom door
for a moment gilchrist with upraised hand tried to control his writhing features
come now bannister said holmes
bannisters face was ghastly
wasnt it natural sir that i should save him and wasnt it natural also that i should try to speak to him as his dead father would have done and make him understand that he could not profit by such a deed
it was before i knew that my sin had found me out
he put his shoes on the table
well come along and put friend soames out of his pain
my friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure but shrugged his shoulders in half humorous resignation
gloves said the young man
you can be perfectly easy in your mind
just close the door said holmes
have you anything positive to tell him
he put his gloves on the chair and he took the proofs sheet by sheet to copy them
there was no man sir
thats the puzzling part
i knew those gloves well and i understood their message
bannister licked his dry lips
but this rascal
no good my dear watson
i could not see that in either case holmes had come upon the clue for which he was searching
meanwhile you change nothingnothing at all
time was sir when i was butler to old sir jabez gilchrist this young gentlemans father when he was ruined i came to the college as servant but i never forgot my old employer because he was down in the world
holmes made no further allusion to the matter that day though he sat lost in thought for a long time after our belated dinner
this the best and only final clue has run to nothing
the mans face set in sullen defiance
when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the windows
he looked at us in a queer way
the foul mouthed fellow at the top
no sir certainly not
very good mr holmes
a tall flaxen haired slim young fellow opened it and made us welcome when he understood our errand
if the proofs were in a roll he could not possibly know what they were
the printer one could of course dismiss
such an idea was absurd
it was not a dangerous exploit for he could always pretend that he had simply looked in to ask a question
in a few hours the examination would commence and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuable scholarship he could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards holmes with two eager hands outstretched
he is taller than the indian not so tall as gilchrist
watson you here
one of them seems restless enough
but why did you change your purpose
i think so
as we know he came back by the side gate
he is the one with the worst record
he could examine the papers in his own office
yes sir i have but the shock of this disgraceful exposure has bewildered me
of the centre table i could make nothing until in your description of gilchrist you mentioned that he was a long distance jumper
shall i do so
up to now you may have spoken the truth but now i know that you have lied
in that case you can give us no further information
his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon bannister in the farther corner
which is yours
i suppose five foot six would be about it
no names please said holmes as we knocked at gilchrists door
you know him
bannister entered and shrank back in evident surprise and fear at our judicial appearance
no indeed said holmes heartily springing to his feet
really mr holmes i cannot undertake to say
good heavens have you nothing to add cried soames
but that fellow does puzzle me
an instant later the tutor returned bringing with him the student
nothing to add
it is not for nothing that i have turned myself out of bed at the untimely hour of six
holmes was so charmed with one of them that he insisted on drawing it in his notebook broke his pencil had to borrow one from our host and finally borrowed a knife to sharpen his own
i will take the black clay with me also the pencil cuttings
you there if you please soames
all were agreed that one could be ordered but that it was not a usual size of pencil and that it was seldom kept in stock
nothing at all sir
no no mr gilchrist sir i never said a wordnever one word cried the servant
what with your eternal tobacco watson and your irregularity at meals i expect that you will get notice to quit and that i shall share your downfallnot however before we have solved the problem of the nervous tutor the careless servant and the three enterprising students
it was the indian whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon his blind
if this matter is not to become public we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court martial
come come bannister
yes sir it is true said he
there is the man who set me in the right path said he
he was a fine figure of a man tall lithe and agile with a springy step and a pleasant open face
aha
ill take the armchair in the middle
yes my dear watson i have solved the mystery
why bannister the servant
the others were invisible
kindly ring the bell
on the other hand it seemed an unthinkable coincidence that a man should dare to enter the room and that by chance on that very day the papers were on the table
who
i have told you everything sir
we can be perfectly frank with each other
now mr gilchrist we are all quite alone here and no one need ever know one word of what passes between us
he was pacing swiftly up and down his room
shall the examination proceed
here it is sir
i dont care who you are
come watson
he shall not compete
there was no possible escape
there is nothing in that
perhaps it would be easier for you if i were to tell mr soames what occurred and you can check me where i am wrong
the man who entered knew that the papers were there
but what fresh evidence could you have got
why should a perfectly honest manwell well heres a large stationers
that is very important said holmes
as he passed your window he saw by means of his great height these proofs upon your table and conjectured what they were
good gracious mr holmes you are surely not going to leave me in this abrupt fashion you dont seem to realize the position
the outer door would not open to our knock and nothing more substantial than a torrent of bad language came from behind it
good bye
as to you sir i trust that a bright future awaits you in rhodesia
i am six feet high and i could do it with an effort no one less than that would have a chance
come come said holmes kindly it is human to err and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal
i think so
i must take some definite action to night
on the palm were three little pyramids of black doughy clay
many men do it when they are trying to learn anything by heart
certainly
well sir when i came into this room yesterday when the alarm was given the very first thing i saw was mr gilchrists tan gloves a lying in that chair
no difficulty in the world soames answered
is it possible
i entered and i took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side table
it will be clear to you from what i have said that only you could have let this young man out since you were left in the room and must have locked the door when you went out as to his escaping by that window it was incredible
what was it you put on that chair near the window
no harm would have been done had it not been that as he passed your door he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant
can you do without breakfast
holmes looked triumphantly at bannister
look at that
the unfortunate young man staggered back and cast a look full of horror and reproach at bannister
our guide cried aloud in his astonishment and dismay
i was measuring how tall a man would need to be in order to see as he passed what papers were on the central table
whats that
have i told the truth mr gilchrist
he thought the tutor must return by the main gate and that he would see him
ah thats a pity bannister
the student had drawn himself erect
i frankly admit that i am unable to prove it
he impressed me as being a perfectly honest man
the unfortunate tutor was certainly in a state of pitiable agitation when we found him in his chambers
the indian still paced his room
and now mr soames i wish you good night
i shall drop round early to morrow morning and chat the matter over
whats his game in the matter
come along and i will personally conduct you
from the moment mr soames that you said to me that no one not even bannister could have told that the papers were in your room the case began to take a definite shape in my mind
well then i must make some suggestions to you
i dismissed that
i flopped down into that chair and nothing would budge me until mr soames he went for you
but indeed i have little doubt that we can build up a sufficient case without it
the situation must be faced
yes let it proceed by all means
now bannister will you please tell us the truth about yesterdays incident
pencils too and knivesall was satisfactory
i cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with
the next he had thrown himself on his knees beside the table and burying his face in his hands he had burst into a storm of passionate sobbing
gilchrist pointed to bannister
if mr soames saw them the game was up
can you tell me his exact height he asked
there were some really curious pieces of mediaeval domestic architecture within
and one more this morning
there were only four stationers of any consequences in the town and at each holmes produced his pencil chips and bid high for a duplicate
how did he know
when i approached your room i examined the window
you will kindly close the door said holmes
no one there i suppose
well if there is nothing to be learned here we had best go inside
i dare not go so far as that
i was in such a hurry to come to you
then he tossed it down and seized the next
good gracious mr holmes do you mean to tell me that all the time i was talking to bannister in this room we had the man prisoner if we had only known it
i found that the key was indeed his that he had entered my room to know if i wanted tea and that he had very carelessly left the key in the door when he came out
the exercise consists of half a chapter of thucydides
i trust mr holmes that you can spare me a few hours of your valuable time
i understand said holmes that you left your key in the door
to my bedroom
where were you when you began to feel bad
i left him collapsed in the chair
let us be practical said he
your servant seems to have quite recovered you left him in a chair you say
i will look after the proofs
yes
for an instant i imagined that i had left my own there but on feeling in my pocket i found that it was all right
above all things i desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly
no one save the printer
the pencil was not an ordinary one
now mr soamesat your disposal
how long did you stay
to the best of my belief they were rolled up
and it looks out on an angle of the courtyard so as to be partly invisible
i will tell you then in a few words the character of the three men who inhabit these rooms
holmes gave an enigmatic smile
the proof was in three long slips
i nearly fainted sir
i should like to have a glance round
he was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreatvery hurried since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there
for an instant i imagined that bannister had taken the unpardonable liberty of examining my papers
i was at my wits end when suddenly the happy thought occurred to me that you were in the town and i came straight round to put the matter into your hands
do help me mr holmes
well anyhow that was in his mind
his plump face was twitching with his nervousness and his fingers could not keep still
you see
the first page on the floor the second in the window the third where you left it said he
i gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair while i made a most careful examination of the room
i must explain to you mr holmes that to morrow is the first day of the examination for the fortescue scholarship
pray continue your very interesting statement
let me see the three strips
no
for which he was entered
holmes halted and looked earnestly at the window
this is of interest watson
we stood at the entrance while holmes made an examination of the carpet
i am one of the examiners
he was nearly expelled over a card scandal in his first year
i dont know sir it didnt matter to me where i sat
did you look at these papers on the table
it began with a thin scratch and ended in a jagged hole
a gothic arched door led to a worn stone staircase
exactly mr holmes
one hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs
excellent said holmes who was recovering his good humour as his attention became more engrossed by the case
there is no opening except the one pane said our learned guide
why did you pass these other chairs
to day about three oclock the proofs of this paper arrived from the printers
i dont know whether you observed my bedroom window
holmes shook his head impatiently
exactly
it was already twilight when we reached the scene of our problem
yes
yes sir
i was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface
by the window there
above were three students one on each story
the moment i looked at my table i was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers
yes there are
i thought i would come back for the key then i forgot
he was looking very badquite ghastly
whom do you suspect
you are aware that johann faber is the most common makers name
and the cuta positive tear i see
have you been in it since your adventure
bannister was very much upset by the incident
i locked up the papers first
as a matter of fact the drawn curtain disclosed nothing but three or four suits of clothes hanging from a line of pegs
what could this n n be
all right come if you want to
my scholar has been left very poor but he is hardworking and industrious
well he carried over this one first and he copied it
where does that door lead to
my friends temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker street
then he approached it and standing on tiptoe with his neck craned he looked into the room
i had however promised to take tea in a friends rooms so i left the proof upon my desk
he must have entered through the door
it is at the end of a word
not only this but on the table i found a small ball of black dough or clay with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it
you left your door open
a large sum of money is at stake for the scholarship is a very valuable one and an unscrupulous man might very well run a risk in order to gain an advantage over his fellows
when mr soames returned and called for you you were very much disturbed
the top floor belongs to miles mclaren
on the ground floor was the tutors room
holmes held it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light
did anyone know that these proofs would be there
this was not all
is it not clear that there is just as much of the pencil left as usually follows the johann he held the small table sideways to the electric light
he shrugged his shoulders in ungracious acquiescence while our visitor in hurried words and with much excitable gesticulation poured forth his story
the man entered and took the papers sheet by sheet from the central table
it was about half past four
i have a new writing table with a fine surface of red leather
it was a small pyramid of black putty like stuff exactly like the one upon the table of the study
the lecturer unlocked the outer door and ushered us into his room
then it amounts to this mr soames that unless the indian student recognized the roll as being proofs the man who tampered with them came upon them accidentally without knowing that they were there
i had left them all together
did this man bannister know
which chair
now i found a clean cut in it about three inches longnot a mere scratch but a positive cut
so it seems to me
i am convinced that these marks were left by the man who rifled the papers
how could you possibly know that
what about this curtain
i had the tea tray in my hand
as a matter of fact he could not said soames for i entered by the side door
he will do well
but might be recognized as proofs
there are others
as you say there appear to be grains of sawdust in it
not one of your cases watsonmental not physical
a broken tip of lead was lying there also
evidently the rascal had copied the paper in a great hurry had broken his pencil and had been compelled to put a fresh point to it
possibly
it is a very delicate question said he
he carried them over to the window table because from there he could see if you came across the courtyard and so could effect an escape
i am prepared to swear and so is bannister that it was smooth and unstained
how came you to leave the key in the door
anyone in the room could get out
i am afraid there are no signs here said he
he has been idling all this term and he must look forward with dread to the examination
exactly
i soon saw that the intruder had left other traces of his presence besides the rumpled papers
let us take the little table first
there were no footmarks and no other evidence as to his identity
the man might have effected his entrance there left traces as he passed through the bedroom and finally finding the door open have escaped that way
no sircertainly not
soames hesitated
we are investigating this unhappy business bannister said his master
very good
i have finished with the carpet
he denied it however with the utmost earnestness and i am convinced that he was speaking the truth
he is a quiet inscrutable fellow as most of those indians are
without his scrapbooks his chemicals and his homely untidiness he was an uncomfortable man
holmes stirred for the first time
but of the three he is perhaps the least unlikely
i beg you mr holmes to do what you can
ah thats good
the case is not entirely devoid of interest
lattice paned lead framework three separate windows one swinging on hinge and large enough to admit a man
mr soames was a tall spare man of a nervous and excitable temperament
no i see nothing
i was absent rather more than an hour
what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself
well said he let us go round
he is a brilliant fellow when he chooses to workone of the brightest intellects of the university but he is wayward dissipated and unprincipled
when did you enter the room
i think it is clear enough
he is well up in his work though his greek is his weak subject
the alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door had known that i was out and had entered to look at the papers
what could he have wanted there
it was most unfortunate sir
when i saw that he was absent i withdrew at once
surely there is another alternative mr holmes
one could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day
thank you that will do said holmes
now mr soames we will take a walk in the quadrangle if you please
with due discretion the incident itself may however be described since it serves to illustrate some of those qualities for which my friend was remarkable i will endeavour in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place or give a clue as to the people concerned
of course what has happened is very clear
well he wrote so furiously that he broke his pencil and had as you observe to sharpen it again
dear me this is very interesting
i see
on the table in the window were several shreds from a pencil which had been sharpened
you see my dilemma
his father was the notorious sir jabez gilchrist who ruined himself on the turf
where is bannister now
as i approached my outer door i was amazed to see a key in it
i had to read it over carefully as the text must be absolutely correct
the lower of the three is gilchrist a fine scholar and athlete plays in the rugby team and the cricket team for the college and got his blue for the hurdles and the long jump
i should much prefer that you called in the aid of the police
papa says he highly approves of my friendship with you and he wishes me to continue it through life
i am not good enough for you and you must be kept from the contamination of too intimate society
in the evenings i confess i do think but i never trouble any one else with my thoughts

and now madam god bless you
i am afraid sir you think me very foolish
and meantime i know the greatness of jehovah i acknowledge the perfection of his word i adore the purity of the christian faith my theory is right my practice horribly wrong
literature cannot be the business of a womans life and it ought not to be
i only exhort you so to think of it and so to use it as to render it conducive to your own permanent good
farewell madam
you will not seek in imagination for excitement of which the vicissitudes of this life and the anxieties from which you must not hope to be exempted be your state what it may will bring with them but too much
at first i could not say thy will be done i felt rebellious but i knew it was wrong to feel so
the day dreams in which you habitually indulge are likely to induce a distempered state of mind and in proportion as all the ordinary uses of the world seem to you flat and unprofitable you will be unfitted for them without becoming fitted for anything else
he gave way
but it is not with a view to distinction that you should cultivate this talent if you consult your own happiness
whoever therefore is ambitious of distinction in this way ought to be prepared for disappointment
keswick march twenty second eighteen thirty seven
why are we to be divided
i must suppress what i feel or you will think me foolishly enthusiastic
it is partly because i think it so admirable and partly because it tends to bring out her character as shown in the following reply that i have taken the liberty of inserting the foregoing extracts from it
it is an inscrutable fatality

robert southey
you first pointed out to me that way in which i am so feebly endeavouring to travel and now i cannot keep you by my side i must proceed sorrowfully alone
take care of over excitement and endeavour to keep a quiet mind even for your health it is the best advice that can be given you your moral and spiritual improvement will then keep pace with the culture of your intellectual powers
for some unexplained reason he had given up the idea of becoming a student of painting at the royal academy and his prospects in life were uncertain and had yet to be settled
the former from reserve the latter from timidity avoided all friendships and intimacies beyond their family emily was impervious to influence she never came in contact with public opinion and her own decision of what was right and fitting was a law for her conduct and appearance with which she allowed no one to interfere her love was poured out on anne as charlottes was on her
what shall i do without you
how long are we likely to be separated why are we to be denied each others society
again i thank you
my father is a clergyman of limited though competent income and i am the eldest of his children
dear madam
and so life and death have dispersed the circle of violent radicals and dissenters into which twenty years ago the little quiet resolute clergymans daughter was received and by whom she was truly loved and honoured
bronte
let me now request that if you ever should come to these lakes while i am living here you will let me see you
what a nice little fir but this was what the tree could not bear to hear
the fir tree
all passed so quickly there was so much going on around him the tree quite forgot to look to himself
no said the tree
how it will shine this evening
what are they about thought the tree
help
were christmas but come
what is it like
the democratic committee figured out a way to do this
i hoped you would be able to assist me on the lawn
the office of sheriff would pay about two thousand a year and this sum hopkins agreed to pay the liveryman and so relieve him of all the annoyance of earning it
im elizabeth parsons
patsy and beth supported their cousin loyally and assisted in the preparations
the description she gave of the coming reception to the womans political league was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus mr hopkins failed to notice who the occupants of the other vehicle were
her eyes wandered to the maids hands
mr hopkins had come to realize that he had the fight of his life on his hands and that defeat meant his political ruin
standing before her was the young girl she had seen riding with mr hopkinsthe girl she had declared to be the missing daughter of mrs rogers
and this was why kenneth and beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy
wont you run into the house and see if martha cant spare one or two more maids
the campaign was now growing warm
how do you know my name and why havent i seen you here before
a sudden wave of scarlet swept over elizas face
im sorry said beth
come in
i have a headache
he did not laugh at his opponents any longer
it was thought that this clever arrangement would easily win the fight for hopkins
the thin fingers clasped and unclasped in little spasmodic jerks and belied the quiet smile upon the face above them
i abhor crowds
i wish said beth slowly i knew you
however her features and form might repress any evidence of nervousness these hands told a different story
she rose quickly to her feet with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath
there are so many people that we cant give them proper attention
chapter twelve
monroe county where both forbes and hopkins resided was one of the democratic strongholds of the state
the maid raised her eyebrows with a gesture of genuine surprise
i counted on eliza parsons the new girl i hired for the linen room and to do mending but eliza said she had a headache this morning and couldnt stand the sun so i let her off
then she gave a little laugh and replied
where is she martha
but it cant be protested the girl
the day of the entertainment was as sunny and mild as heart could desire
under ordinary conditions reynolds was sure to be elected but the committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to elect hopkins
i will go said beth a little frightened at the passionate appeal
will you excuse my answering that question she asked
eliza closed the door behind her with a decided slam and a key clicked in the lock
arent you lucy rogers
this was why he held several long conferences with his friend marshall the manager at the mill
we ought to have more attendants beth said louise approaching her cousin
every scheme known to politicians must be worked and none knew the intricate game better than hopkins
ill go and ask her
the fairview band was engaged to discourse as much harmony as it could produce and the resources of the great house were taxed to entertain the guests
so she greeted the girl cordially and said
maids
to himself he admitted their shrewdness and activity and acknowledged that an experienced head was managing their affairs
eliza parsons shook her head
beth meets a rebuff
the only thing necessary was to fix seth reynolds and this hopkins arranged personally
the gardens and grounds were gaily decorated with chinese and japanese lanterns streamers and forbes banners
but she didnt seem very sick to me
mr cummings who was to profit by the deal was called to a private consultation and agreed to slaughter kenneth forbes to secure votes for himself
i obtained the situation only a few days ago
theythey excite me in some way and ii cant bear them
this canvass was quite satisfactory for final report showed only about a hundred majority for forbes
this trading votes which was often done was considered by the politicians quite legitimate
by ten oclock the farm wagons began to drive up loaded with women and children for all were invited except the grown men
excuse me please
i wish i knew myself she cried fiercely
tables were spread on the lawn and a dainty but substantial repast was to be served
her manner was neither independent nor assertive but rather one of well bred composure and calm reliance
she even seemed mildly amused at the attention she attracted
the girl entered and gave an involuntary cry of surprise
where is your home
a man named cummings was the republican and seth reynolds the liveryman the democratic nominee
a speakers stand profusely decorated had been erected on the lawn and hundreds of folding chairs provided for seats
for a moment beth stood staring while the new maid regarded her with composure and a slight smile upon her beautiful face
why cannot you answer it
but the honorable erastus had no intention of taking chances or monkeying with fate as he tersely expressed it
mr hopkins had picked her up from the path leading from the rear gate of the elmhurst grounds and she had given him accurate information concerning the movements of the girl campaigners
louise was making great preparations to entertain the womans political league an organization she had herself founded the members of which were wives of farmers in the district
beth felt that she was intruding and knew that she ought to go yet some fascination held her to the spot
you must excuse me
no miss beth
i attend to the household mending you know and care for the linen
beth looked at the strange girl without taking the hint to retire somehow she could not rid herself of the impression that whether or not she was mistaken in supposing eliza to be the missing lucy she had stumbled upon a sphinx whose riddle was well worth solving
beth was a beautiful girlthe handsomest of the three cousins by far yet eliza surpassed her in natural charm and seemed well aware of the fact
she sat down in a rocking chair and clasping her hands in her lap rocked slowly back and forth
but to offset this cheering condition the democratic agents who made the canvass reported that there was an air of uncertainty throughout the district and that many of those who declared for hopkins were lukewarm and faint hearted and might easily be induced to change their votes this was what must be prevented
for the first time the maid seemed a little confused and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor
i had to stand by lucyshes so sweet and gentle and so sensitive
and it ruins a mans disposition
no indeed he replied frankly
then he deliberately locked kenneth and beth in with the forger and retreated along the passage
ill pay twice sixty dollars for the delivery to me of the forged check and the withdrawal of the prosecution
he was fairly prosperous before that for mrs rogers was an energetic and sensible woman and kept old will hard at work
is there no way to save him asked kenneth
i admit that
but it was a generous act too said beth
no old will is a fine fellow but poor and helpless since mrs rogers had her accident
ill pay all the costs besides
kenneth and beth went away quite happy with their success and the manager stood in his little window and watched them depart
fairview was twelve miles away but by ten oclock they drew up at the county jail
lucy could have looked after her mother said young bates but old will was stubborn and wouldnt let her
the manager was in kenneth and beth learned but could not see them until he had signed the letters he had dictated for the noon mail
we wish to talk with him answered kenneth
yes shell worry about me i know
her husband didnt tell us that said the girl
sure ly
if the prosecution were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the forged check then the young man would be allowed his freedom but under the circumstances i doubt if such an arrangement could be made
i was bookkeeper so it was easy to get a blank check and forge the signature
ill come and get you then
it was a busy place perhaps the busiest in the whole of the eighth district and in it were employed a large number of men
you dont smoke do you mr forbes
the squierses are a selfish hard fisted lot and the old lady especially is a well known virago but they could not have proven a case against lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of arresting her were probably mere bluff
pay it ken she whispered
why did you do it asked beth
i understand now said beth
by compromising with me you can recover your loss and are paid for your annoyance
sorry we havent any reception room in the jail
but hes very young and his youth is largely responsible for his folly
they were received in the little office by a man named markham who was the jailer
well stick it out old man dont give in
ive just stopped smoking a few days ago and its got on my nerves something awful
my crime is so serious that the circuit judge has to sit on the case
he is supposed to sign all the checks of the concern
no mr markham
it wont be much but im grateful to find a friend im guilty you know and theres no one to blame but myself
miss degraf said kenneth noticing the boys face critically as he stood where the light from the passage fell upon it
he spoke simply but paced up and down the narrow cell in front of them it was evident that his feelings were deeper than he cared to make evident
it was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved
indeed there is never an excuse for crime
i havent heard from her since the day she came here to see meright after my arrest
so the girl saw something must be done and went to work
whose name did you sign to the check asked kenneth
hes a forger mr forbes a deliberate criminal
there was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face
why should you do all this
thats different observed markham altering his demeanor you mustnt mind my being gruff and grumpy mr forbes
he also wrote a note to his lawyer directing him to withdraw the prosecution
come this way please
it has cost me twice sixty dollars in annoyance
yes sir
weve come to inquire about your case gates said kenneth
well sir what about him
you may as well understand sir that i stand for the democratic candidate and have no sympathy with your side
thats how all the trouble came about
the mill was at the outskirts of the town
ive come to talk with you about young gates
the forged check
but ill have a trial in a few days they say
yes
why hes a fool thats what he is
well what for he demanded
shes at home i suppose
im so glad kenso glad
how are you feeling today
lucy is very proud
that doesnt interest me especially sir answered kenneth smiling im not electioneering just now
he only discharged the man who was responsible for the fire
he detested the grasping disposition that would endeavor to take advantage of his evident desire to help young gates
i have my own reasons mr marshall
thank you mr markham replied a quiet voice as a young man came forward from the dim interior of the cell
i only say id do the same thing again
please look at the matter from a business standpoint
he was soft hearted and impetuous said beth and being in love he didnt stop to count the cost
so as soon as breakfast was over the next morning beth and kenneth took one of the automobiles the boy consenting unwillingly to this sort of locomotion because it would save much time
he might have had that forged check for the face of it if hed been sharp you wouldnt catch rast hopkins doing such a fool stunt
but marshall never even thanked me
he looked up rather ungraciously but motioned them to be seated
he stole my money
i am kenneth forbes of elmhurst
it was better for him to think the girl unfeeling than to know the truth
we have heard something of your story said kenneth and are interested in it
its nearly two weeks now
he was a round faced respectable appearing fellow but his mood was distinctly unsociable
oh did she have an accident asked beth
he was silent and turned his face away
kenneth hesitated a moment
im running for representative on the republican ticket said kenneth quietly
would you like that asked beth
he was of sturdy athletic build and dressed neatly in a suit that was of coarse material but well brushed and cared for
if you send the boy to prison you will still suffer the loss of the money
then rogers wouldnt do anything but lead her around and wait upon her and the place went to rack and ruin
i wont tom
sure ly mr forbes
yes sir i plead guilty although ive been told i ought not to confess
i discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the whole plant
ive seen lots of that kind in my day
give me a check for a hundred and fifty and ill turn over to you the forged check and quash further proceedings
and now we must find the girl
ive been bothered already over your election campaign resumed the manager arranging his papers in a bored manner
so this boy was doubly foolish in ruining himself to get sixty dollars to pay an unjust demand
a fresh wholesome looking boy was tom gates with steady gray eyes an intelligent forehead but a sensitive rather weak mouth
ill take you to his cell myself
the young man is guilty and he must suffer the penalty
couldnt her parents have helped her inquired kenneth
youre right
talk whats the good
heres visitors tom
kenneth decided that he was ill at ease and in a state of dogged self repression
of all the easy marks i ever encountered muttered mr marshall this young forbes is the easiest
i dont say i did right
his trial has not yet taken place and instead of your devoting considerable of your valuable time appearing against him it would be much simpler to settle the matter right here and now
one morning she tried to light the fire with kerosene and lost her sight
forbes of elmhurst he asked glancing at the card kenneth had sent in
ill make your money loss good
how long ago were you arrested asked beth
youre no friend of tom gates
but it will be best that way
and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars
shes blind
kenneth and beth refrained from telling the other girls or uncle john of old will rogerss visit but they got mr watson in the library and questioned him closely about the penalty for forging a check
beth uneasy at his silence nudged him
he unlocked the door and called
thank you sir
i cant see it in that light said the old lawyer
and he deserves a term in states prison
in what way mr forbes
im going to see mr marshall said kenneth and discover what i can do to assist you
will you leave us alone please mr markham
were going to try it anyhow was the prompt decision
nevertheless i should like to save him said kenneth
had i had i
here is his scarf which has evidently been strained and on it are spots of blood while all around are marks indicating a struggle
have we been together thats his knife at any rate
it did not beckon or indeed move at all it was as still as the hand of death
gradually i knew i was mastering himthen all was blank
i think i am ill
what is that in your hand
look mr blake do you recognize this
then i heard tom say
dark dreams and night shadows
but you have been together
i say you do know what this means and you must tell us
a flash of light
what could it be
chapter eleven
my position was too terrible
ii do not know
what was that
undoubtedly the egyptian knew too much for voltaire and so i was made a tool whereby he could be freed from troublesome obstacles
then i fell down at tom temples feet
i stood alone
hes better now
of course not said joyce
i just touched something soft on the instant joyce was at her side with the candle
presently she spoke
the poor little things cried cynthia
first they took turns sweeping as best they could with a very ancient and frowsy broom the thick moth eaten carpet
but theyll have to do
ive got it she announced
perhaps thats so admitted joyce thoughtfully
you must be right admitted cynthia
these two cherubic infants had both big brown eyes fat red cheeks and adorable fluffy golden curls

i thought we were stumped again when i first saw that picture but its been of some use after all
but lets go and finish our studying now and get that out of the way
i wonder though if people could see the light from the street through any chinks in the boarding
they were certainly no nearer the solution of their problem
im just dog tired
there isnt a doubt but what that baby was she
what annoyance
do you wish it
believe me it is not fatigue that saddens you to night
i suspect
bodily i suppose
no i wish to talk to you
i leave you then said raoul as he withdrew
night
yes you are right but i do not think any danger is to be apprehended from buckingham
yes bodily
cruelly
i am fatigued
the count advanced a step towards his friend and pressed him warmly in his arms
nay where it does exist
no still he is intrusive
what do you mean
one could almost swear to it to observe him
what i said to him count replied raoul i will repeat to you listen to me
concord returned to its place amidst the tents
that of this evening
i wish you good night
she changed color for a moment and looked at him with a pretty reluctant tenderness as she took her chair
i hope you have no prejudice against americans
our first impressions of people are in nine cases out of ten the right impressions
my spirits sank as i looked round me
mr meadowcrofts invalid chair had been wheeled to the head of the table
the door opened once more
even when he spoke to mr meadowcroft he was still on his guardon his guard against the two young men as i fancied by the direction which his eyes took on these occasions
i liked naomi colebrook at first sight liked her pleasant smile liked her hearty shake of the hand when we were presented to each other
he looked up at naomi doubtingly from his plate and looked down again slowly with a frown when i addressed him he answered constrainedly
i looked at my watch
i followed the groom up to my room not over well pleased with my first experience of the farm
on his righthand side sat his sad and silent daughter
when we began our meal i had noticed for the first time that silas meadowcrofts left hand was strapped up with surgical plaster and i now further observed that john jagos wandering brown eyes furtively looking at everybody round the table in turn looked with a curious cynical scrutiny at the young mans injured hand
he was short spare and wiry singularly pale for a person whose life was passed in the country
the face was in other respects besides this a striking face to see
when the two sons seized a stray remark of mine about animals in general and applied it satirically to the mismanagement of sheep and oxen in particular they looked at john jago while they talked to me
the supper was not a merry one
she was a melancholy middle aged woman without visible attractions of any sortone of those persons who appear to accept the obligation of living under protest as a burden which they would never have consented to bear if they had only been consulted first
he is not well he has come over the ocean for rest and change of scene
a young lady quietly joined the party at the supper table
was the young lady naomi colebrook
for once in a way i proved a true prophet
describing her generally i may say that she had a small head well carried and well set on her shoulders bright gray eyes that looked at you honestly and meant what they looked a trim slight little figuretoo slight for our english notions of beauty a strong american accent and a rare thing in america a pleasantly toned voice which made the accent agreeable to english ears
a more dreary and more disunited family party i never sat at the table with
a little crackedthat in the popular phrase was my impression of the stranger who now made his appearance in the supper room
my library was limited to the bible and the prayer book
naomi colebrook at last
but there was no marked character in either face
i set them down as men with undeveloped qualities waiting the good and evil qualities alike for time and circumstances to bring them to their full growth
they pointedly drew back from john jago as he approached the empty chair next to me and moved round to the opposite side of the table
a pretty girl and so far as i could judge by appearances a good girl too
my room was cleanoppressively clean
there i put the pilots seat and a strong tiller for the rudder
and these shall follow your thralls in the same way
there stand so i said and glare and hiss at my foes
on a bench in a far corner were a dozen people huddled together
so i set guards over every one in that house
oh it is better to live on the sea and let other men raise your crops and cook your meals
he took it and smiled saying
who calls
their eyes danced
i sat high in the pilots seat
but i stayed that spring and built me a boat
now for the farm
i drink this to your health
have you always been a thrall
two hundred warriors feasted in his hall and followed him to battle
the thralls were bringing in a great pot of meat
my men roared with laughter
he shall not leave you day or night whether you are working or playing or sleeping
you would not eat with us
do you not think we shall be merry company
i stood with my back to the wall for i wanted no sword reaching out of the dark for me
we ate at many mens tables uninvited
he had three ships
now start up the fire i said
i call i answered
off they ran through a door at the back of the hall
so we harried the coast of norway
on the breast and sides i carved the dragons scales
there far off is my country across the water
what man wants to spend the winter with no guests
the night that it was finished i went to my fathers feast
the farmer crouched by the fire afraid to move
i named nine others and said
we went to it and i struck it with my spear
did you ever have such a lordly guest before
after a while my men said
many men we found overburdened with gold
come come i called when no one obeyed
i went on
viking is better for summer
ah another then cried out sitting up
a fire
the thralls eyes flashed
at last i stood up and said
not yet i answered
then i will get me a farm and will winter in that land
we are hungry
i thought that all this nights work would be my death
but others jumped to their feet with their mead horns in their hands thirty men one after another raised their horns and said
what of the farm olaf
up and down the water we went to get much wealth and much frolic
here comes something that will be a welcome guest to my stomach
so no tales got out to the neighbors
i heard a cuckoo to day
well after we had been there for a long time hakon came in to the feast one night and said
on the next morning we got into my dragon and started
hello
ten sons sat at meat with him and i was the youngest
all my men put their hands to their mouths and shouted
ho thralls i called to them
at the prow i carved the head with open mouth and forked tongue thrust out
bring in the table
leif and grim shall be the same kind of friends to your two sons
it was so dark that i could see nothing but a few sparks on the hearth
the farmer sat gloomily on the bench and would not eat and you cannot wonder for he saw us putting potfuls of his good beef and basket loads of bread into our big mouths when the tables were taken out and the mead horns came round i stood up and raised my horn and said to the farmer
they set up a crane over the fire and hung the pot upon it and we sat and watched it boil while we joked
there were benches for twenty men along each side
the eldest of you shall have my farm when i die
so i will give out this law that my men shall never leave you alone
there was but one door to the house
well friend farmer laughed one why such a long face
now who will follow me
come they cried thank him for that farmer
since it is to my health i will drink it
the door opened only a little but i pushed it wide and leaped into the room
hello i shouted and my men made a great din
yes a stingy host
besides it was a lonely place and by good luck no one came that way
as our boat flashed down the rollers into the water i made this song and sang it
my dragons belly is never full and on board went the gold
the rest of you off a viking
this is my vow i will sail to norway and i will harry the coast and fill my boat with riches
i like this little taste of your hospitality friend farmer
at last some one from inside said
so we set off for it
at last the supper began
these he gave to three of my brothers
when an artery is tied the lateral channels increase not only in diameter but in the thickness and strength of their coats
effects of the increased use and disuse of parts
but this subject will be more properly discussed when we treat of the different races of mankind
when one kidney ceases to act from disease the other increases in size and does double work
it is well known that use strengthens the muscles in the individual and complete disuse or the destruction of the proper nerve weakens them when the eye is destroyed the optic nerve often becomes atrophied
gould endeavoured to ascertain the nature of the influences which thus act on stature but he arrived only at negative results namely that they did not relate to climate the elevation of the land soil nor even in any controlling degree to the abundance or the need of the comforts of life
dr beddoe has lately proved that with the inhabitants of britain residence in towns and certain occupations have a deteriorating influence on height and he infers that the result is to a certain extent inherited as is likewise the case in the united states
whether external conditions produce any other direct effect on man is not known
our supposed naturalist having proceeded thus far in his investigation would next enquire whether the races of men when crossed were in any degree sterile
in determining whether the supposed varieties of the same kind of domestic animal should be ranked as such or as specifically distinct that is whether any of them are descended from distinct wild species every naturalist would lay much stress on the fact of their external parasites being specifically distinct
all the more stress would be laid on this fact as it would be an exceptional one for i am informed by mr denny that the most different kinds of dogs fowls and pigeons in england are infested by the same species of pediculi or lice
now let us apply these generally admitted principles to the races of man viewing him in the same spirit as a naturalist would any other animal
the races differ also in constitution in acclimatisation and in liability to certain diseases
we know that these qualities are easily affected by changed conditions of life or by close inter breeding and that they are governed by highly complex laws for instance that of the unequal fertility of converse crosses between the same two species
mr murray procured four kinds from africa namely from the negroes of the eastern and western coasts from the hottentots and kaffirs two kinds from the natives of australia two from north and two from south america
in these latter cases it may be presumed that the pediculi came from natives inhabiting different districts
even a slight degree of sterility between any two forms when first crossed or in their offspring is generally considered as a decisive test of their specific distinctness and their continued persistence without blending within the same area is usually accepted as sufficient evidence either of some degree of mutual sterility or in the case of animals of some mutual repugnance to pairing
they give also corroborative evidence but c vogt thinks that the subject requires further investigation that the human skulls found in the caves of brazil entombed with many extinct mammals belonged to the same type as that now prevailing throughout the american continent
the degrees of sterility do not coincide strictly with the degrees of difference between the parents in external structure or habits of life
our naturalist would then perhaps turn to geographical distribution and he would probably declare that those forms must be distinct species which differ not only in appearance but are fitted for hot as well as damp or dry countries and for the arctic regions
it is here manifestly impossible to select the more sterile individuals which have already ceased to yield seeds so that the acme of sterility when the germen alone is affected cannot have been gained through selection
father ripa makes exactly the same remark with respect to the chinese and the hindoo cannot at first perceive any difference between the several european nations
these pediculi were darker coloured and appeared different from those proper to the natives of chiloe in south america of which he gave me specimens
chapter seven
their mental characteristics are likewise very distinct chiefly as it would appear in their emotional but partly in their intellectual faculties
in every case in which many specimens were obtained the differences were constant the surgeon of a whaling ship in the pacific assured me that when the pediculi with which some sandwich islanders on board swarmed strayed on to the bodies of the english sailors they died in the course of three or four days
even some of the most strongly marked races cannot be identified with that degree of unanimity which might have been expected from what has been written on the subject
dr rohlfs writes to me that he found the mixed races in the great sahara derived from arabs berbers and negroes of three tribes extraordinarily fertile
these again appeared larger and much softer than european lice
with forms which must be ranked as undoubted species a perfect series exists from those which are absolutely sterile when crossed to those which are almost or completely fertile
geographical distribution is often brought into play unconsciously and sometimes consciously so that forms living in two widely separated areas in which most of the other inhabitants are specifically distinct are themselves usually looked at as distinct but in truth this affords no aid in distinguishing geographical races from socalled good or true species
nevertheless these men if seen alive would undoubtedly appear very distinct so that we are clearly much influenced in our judgment by the mere colour of the skin and hair by slight differences in the features and by expression
during this time at the other end of the theater near the lake a young woman was seated with her eyes fixed upon one of the windows of the theater from which were issuing streams of lightthe window in question being that of the royal box
forgive me i hardly know what i am saying a thousand times forgive me madame was right quite right this brutal exile has completely turned my brain
de guiche observing that she was alone near a thicket constructed of painted cloth approached her
with this remark accompanied by one of those deep sighs which affect the remotest fibers of ones being his heart burdened with sorrow and throbbing fast his head on fire and his gaze wandering he bowed breathlessly and withdrew behind the thicket
de guiche had overheard everything
the victim however of all these royal affections and affectations was poor de guiche every one could observe his agitation and prostrationa prostration which was indeed the more remarkable since people were not accustomed to see him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side his head bewildered and his eyes with all their bright intelligence bedimmed
do you love any one
yes but if she should have understood and understood too well she may talk
do you think so she replied with indifference
come said la valliere these gentlemen have passed let us take advantage of our being alone to cross the open ground and so take refuge in the woods
good gracious has the king any right to interfere in matters of that kind
in what way
received me with kindnessperhaps soyes
oh there can be no doubt of it
beneath this oak the gardeners had piled up the moss and turf in such a manner that never had a seat more luxuriously rested the wearied limbs of man or monarch
she saw but did not look at de guiche who irritated and revengeful turned his back upon her as she passed him escorted by her nymphs and followed by a hundred flatterers
indeed
in that case i am indeed unhappy and greatly to be pitied
you are positive then
upon this madame deigned to turn her eyes languishingly towards the comte observing
it seems the king will not consent to it
in other words said montalais she is insupportable
you mean pomona comte
athenais began to laugh
a quarter of an hour afterwards he returned to the theater but it will be readily believed that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement that enabled him to go back or perhaps for love is thus strangely constituted he found it impossible even to remain much longer separated from the presence of one who had broken his heart
you represented a divinity beautiful disdainful inconstant
near the songster in the dark background of the large trees could be seen the glistening eyes of an owl attracted by the harmony
yes very unhappy and very much to be pitied monsieur de guiche for you seem to be suffering terribly
why do you ask she inquired
look yonder do you not see the moon slowly rising silvering the topmost branches of the chestnuts and the oaks
remarking therefore that his obeisance obtained him no acknowledgement he advanced one step further and in a voice which he tried though vainly to render calm said i have the honor to present my most humble respects to your royal highness
a cold shiver passed through poor de guiche he was unprepared for such utter indifference for he had neither seen nor been told of anything that had taken place and consequently could guess nothing
quick quick then among the high reed grass said montalais stoop athenais you are so tall
have i offended you again said de guiche
ah
and you louise said montalais does any one please you
good day
do you who are so clever finish for me
louise possesses every virtue and has not a single fault and the two young men passed on and as they proceeded their voices were soon lost in the distance
what already here they said to her
out yonder all are at this moment seated at table and fully occupied or preparing to adorn themselves for a set and formal promenade horses are being saddled or harnessed to the carriagesthe queens mules or madames four white ponies
quite true and i believe you are right
we are three in number we like one another and the night is lovely
no more than the dancing
explain yourself
the arrow pierced his heart and wounded him mortally
yes but perhaps i frightened her
i oh no
the king remained for a moment to enjoy a triumph as complete as it could possibly be
the three young girls on their side reached the outskirts of the park every path of which they well knew
the ditches were bordered by high hedges full of flowers which on that side protected the foot passengers from being intruded upon by the horses and carriages
oh
i am a woman and there are few like me whoever loves me flatters me whoever flatters me pleases me and whoever pleases
no
i remember now and i congratulate myself
all these sufferings successes and remarks were blended confounded and lost in the uproar of applause
the young girls had indeed made themselves smallindeed invisible
there cannot be a doubt he received you kindly for in fact you returned without his permission
pray do not leave me said de guiche stretching out his hand towards her for you would be contradicting the kind words you have just pronounced
montalais agile as a deer athenais eager as a young wolf bounded through the dry grass and now and then some bold acteon might by the aid of the faint light have perceived their straight and well formed limbs somewhat displayed beneath the heavy folds of their satin petticoats
do you think so
she then rose humming the air to which she was presently going to dance
he then turned towards madame for the purpose of admiring her also a little in her turn
but surely the enchanting spectacle
at this moment a man concealed in a dry ditch planted with young willow saplings scrambled quickly up its shelving side and ran off in the direction of the chateau
well said montalais you do not finish
you seem agitated
oh mademoiselle why have i not a devoted sister or a true friend such as yourself
we thought we should be first at the rendezvous
yes the character which your royal highness assumed is in perfect harmony with your own
i was still half crazy at you know what so that she could hardly have understood what i was saying and must have grown alarmed
when she perceived the young man she rose like a woman surprised in the midst of ideas she was desirous of concealing from herself
oh
as for ourselves we shall soon reach some retired spot where no eyes can see us and no step follow ours
so much the better said athenais because i see the torches setting out from the chateau and the theater and they seem as if they were preceding some person of distinction
remain i implore you the evening is most lovely
yes
if i had only seen her i should have declared it to be a vision but i spoke to her
you wish to escape from the merry tumult and prefer your own society
i allude to the goddess
his dark shadow glided lengthening as it disappeared among the illumined yews and glittering undulations of the water
and confidences too
oh
the two young men approached still closer conversing in animated tones she was here just now said the count
i am speaking seriously replied montalais and my opinion in this case is quite as good as the kings i suppose is it not louise
and yet it seemed to me that the king received you with kindness
it is to your recommendation i am aware that i owe my admission among the number of madames maids of honor
heaven he exclaimed suddenly
as de guiche quitted the theater for the purpose of getting into the fresh air he so much needed he passed close to this figure and saluted her
well i can understand it all women who are possessed of any feeling do and one never finds them dull or lonely when removed from the giddy vortex of these exciting amusements
the only reply madame condescended to make was by slightly raising her shoulders and as her ladies of honor had discreetly retired while the conversation lasted she recalled them by a look
it rarely happened that any uneasiness was excited on his account whenever a question of elegance or taste was under discussion and de guiches defeat was accordingly attributed by the greater number present to his courtier like tact and ability
you do not know louise count said raoul
well
the ballet of the seasons
sire they were sent at the hour promised
yes it is suppressed
monsieur was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter
at the conclusion of the banquet which was served at five oclock the king entered his cabinet where his tailors were awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated costume representing spring which was the result of so much imagination and had cost so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornament workers of the court
what do you mean inquired louis
in my thoughts monsieur everything has changed
the elements subaltern powers of mythology together with their attributes hastened to follow their gracious sovereign
the applause continued so long that the comte had ample leisure to join the king
nothing however has changed since then on the contrary indeed
certainly not sire but your majesty did not tell me to remain
the ballet began the effect was more than beautiful
entirely
my affairs concern myself alone monsieur and i have already told you i transact them without interference
the king felt himself color deeply and said you are probably mistaken
she however did not bestow a single glance upon him
their flattery pleased as much as de guiches courage had astonished him and he simply replied i did not tell you to return comte
you will take them from my private treasure colbert bowed
it must be suppressed
suddenly for the purpose of restoring peace and order spring accompanied by his whole court made his appearance
he has given them with too much grace not to have others still to give if they are required which is the case at the present moment
are you sure
besides the kings heart was filled with two or three new ideas he had just derived fresh inspiration from the eloquent glances of madame
the king who had from this moment become in reality the principal dancer in the quadrille cast a look upon his vanquished rival
nothing whatever replied the courtier as pale as death but your majesty has not thought of fruits
but what
her look had said to him since they are jealous of you divide their suspicions for the man who distrusts two rivals does not object to either in particular so that madame by this clever diversion decided him
as for the ballet itself every person knew the part he had to take in it and how to perform it
well sire the colored lamps the fireworks the musicians and the cooks have swallowed up four millions in eight days
seven hundred thousand francs sire
yes sire and ready dressed for the ballet
the king seemed only pleased with every one present
here replied the king frowning here
louis turned hastily towards the side and in fact on his right brilliant in his character of autumn de guiche awaited until the king should look at him in order that he might address him
the seasons allies of spring followed him closely to form a quadrille which after many words of more or less flattering import was the commencement of the dance
then i perceive said colbert trembling with anger and fear that i have had the misfortune to fall into disgrace with your majesty
the news circulated with the rapidity of lightning during its progress it kindled every variety of coquetry desire and wild ambition
to the last penny
well
i did not wish to be the substance of so dark a shadow to your majestys elegance skill and graceful invention and i have left my tenants in order to place my services at your majestys commands
far from it sire your majesty having given no directions about it the musicians have retained it
he was dressed in a tunic of flowers which set off his graceful and well formed figure to advantage
why so
every word fell distinctly in perfect harmony and eloquence upon louis the fourteenths ears
de guiche soon ceased to sustain even the character of the courtier without applause he danced indifferently and very soon could not dance at all by which accident the triumph of the king and of madame was assured
the theater represented a grove of trees a few fauns lifting up their cloven feet were jumping about a dryad made her appearance on the scene and was immediately pursued by them others gathered round her for her defense and they quarrelled as they danced
at the same moment as if by enchantment every one who knew how to hold a needle every one who could distinguish a coat from a pair of trousers was summoned to the assistance of those who had received invitations the king had completed his toilette by nine oclock he appeared in an open carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers
and yet he said your majesty did not use this language some time ago when the news about belle isle arrived for instance
but come since
the most beautiful pale lilac satin shoes with bows of flowers and leaves imprisoned his small feet
his legs the best shaped at court were displayed to great advantage in flesh colored silken hose of silk so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself
certainly sire but i must have money to do that
disdainful of a success of which madame showed no acknowledgement he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the marked preference of the princess
i reserve your services for a better occasion and believe me they will only be the better appreciated
the music hautboys flutes and viols was delightfully descriptive of rural delights
and added louis as it seems a difficult matter for you notwithstanding your economy to defray with so limited a sum the expenses which i intend to incur i will at once sign an order for three millions
the king had resolved to make it surprise
his entrance produced therefore the most brilliant effect
by degrees as the sight became accustomed to so much brilliancy the rarest beauties appeared to the view as in the evening sky the stars appear one by one to him who closes his eyes and then opens them again
it is necessary therefore that he should comply
such was the prince of that period justly that evening styled the king of all the loves there was something in his carriage which resembled the buoyant movements of an immortal and he did not dance so much as seem to soar along
when the music by its bursts of melody carried away these illustrious dancers when the simple untutored pantomime of that period only the more natural on account of the very indifferent acting of the august actors had reached its culminating point of triumph the theater shook with tumultuous applause
so little is that the case sire that if your majesty will look to the right you will see that the comte is in waiting
colbert said he accentuating the financiers name that is not the way i understood the matter i do not wish to make use against any of my servants of a means of pressure which may oppress him and fetter his services
the queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent dias or platform erected upon the borders of the lake in a theater of wonderful elegance of construction
not at all you are on the contrary most agreeable to me
the king smiled upon de guiche who did not comprehend a word of madames dumb language but he remarked that she pretended not to look at him and he attributed the pardon which had been conferred upon him to the princesss kindness of heart
the poor child lay senseless on the ground bleeding profusely from his head
the surgeon desired them not to talk to him but leave him to repose
finally to corroborate all the other indications and confirm the truth of her discovery beyond all question she counted the steps of the staircase leading from the room to the street and found the number exactly what she had expected for she had had the presence of mind to count them on the former occasion when she descended them blindfold
many gentlemen followed him greatly distressed at the sad accident which had befallen the general favourite for it was soon on everybodys lips that the sufferer was little luis
the hopes her mother had given her of being his wife began to droop and the fear came strong upon her that such bliss was not for one so luckless as herself
the bed she too well remembered was there and above all the cabinet on which had stood the image she had taken away was still on the same spot
she told him that she would endeavour to marry him in conformity with his inclination and that he need not make himself uneasy for there would be no difficulty in breaking off the match which seemed so distasteful to him
his grandfather and grandmother were so delighted with his grace beauty and good behaviour that they came at last to regard their daughters mischance as a happy event since it had given them such a grandson
know then son of my heart that this fainting lady is your real bride i say real because she is the one whom your father and i have chosen for you and the portrait was a pretence
her bearing was graceful and animated she led her son by the hand and before her walked two maids with wax lights and silver candlesticks
the lady soon appeared presenting a most charming spectacle of perfect beauty set off by the most appropriate adornments
he embraced and comforted leocadia kissed his grandson and that same day he despatched a courier to naples with a letter to his son requiring him to come home instantly for his mother and he had concluded a suitable match for him with a very beautiful lady
what you had best do my child is to keep it and pray to it that since it was a witness to your undoing it will deign to vindicate your cause by its righteous judgment
rodolfo meanwhile having returned home and having missed the crucifix guessed who had taken it but gave himself no concern about it
this was done for the event took place at a time when the consent of the parties was sufficient for the celebration of a marriage without any of the preliminary formalities which are now so properly required
rodolfo thanked her and supper being ready they went to join the rest of the party at table
she counted the chairs and the cabinets observed the position of the door and also perceived some pictures hanging on the walls but was not able to distinguish the subjects
the master and mistress begged them not to cry or raise their voices in lamentation for it would do the little patient no good
among other things on which she cast her eyes was a small crucifix of solid silver standing on a cabinet near the window
they added that rodolfo told them on the following day that he had carried the girl to his own apartment and this was all they knew of the matter
after a prosperous run of twelve days he reached barcelona whence he posted in seven to toledo and entered his fathers house dressed in the very extreme of fashionable bravery
finally the one party went off exulting and the other was left in desolation and woe
go she said to a servant and ask the senora
real dishonour consists in sin and real honour in virtue
unless you speak more fully senora i cannot understand you replied her husband
she meanwhile passed her life with her parents in the strictest retirement never letting herself be seen but shunning every eye lest it should read her misfortune in her face
i am surprised at it myself and i perceive that if great sorrows are sometimes dumb they are sometimes eloquent be this as it may grant me the favour i implore it will cost you little
the damask hangings were no longer there but she recognised it by other tokens she saw the grated window that opened on the garden it was then closed on account of the little patient but she asked if there was a garden on the outside and was answered in the affirmative
one day when the boy was sent by his grandfather with a message to a relation he passed along a street in which there was a great concourse of horsemen
let me not survive my disgrace
all rose to do her reverence as if something from heaven had miraculously appeared before them but gazing on her entranced with admiration not one of them was able to address a single word to her
the boy who was named luis after his grandfather was remarkably handsome of a sweet docile disposition and his manners and deportment even at that tender age were such as showed him to be the son of some noble father
rodolfo had long contemplated a visit to italy and his father who himself had been there encouraged him in that design telling him that no one could be a finished gentleman without seeing foreign countries
this shocking news reached the ears of her parents whom dona estafania had concealed in another room that they might make their appearance at the right moment
she succeeded in opening the window and the moonlight shone in so brightly that she could distinguish the colour of some damask hangings in the room
rodolfo was now impatient to get rid of leocadia and made up his mind to lay her in the street insensible as she was
time rolled on the hour of her delivery arrived it took place in the utmost secrecy her mother taking upon her the office of midwife and she gave birth to a son one of the most beautiful ever seen
she made all this known to her husband and it was finally settled between the three that they should not move in the matter for the present but wait till the will of heaven had declared itself respecting the little patient
base villain she cried you took an infamous advantage of me when i had no more power to resist than a stock or a stone but now that i have recovered my senses you shall kill me before you shall succeed
the boy found his recovery in this house and i found in it reminiscences of events i shall never forget as long as i live
in about half an hour as it seemed to her the door was opened some one came in blindfolded her and taking her by the arm without a word spoken led her out of the room which she heard him lock behind him
he was greatly confused at finding that he had betrayed such emotion but his mother who guessed his thoughts said to him do not be ashamed my son at having been so overcome by your feelings you would have been so still more had you known what i will no longer conceal from you though i had intended to reserve it for a more joyful occasion
on seeing his wife all in tears and leocadia fainting he eagerly inquired the cause of so startling a spectacle
at last they sat down to a merry supper to the sound of music for the performers who had been previously engaged were now arrived
apathy and disgust commonly follow satiated lust
the two parties the sheep and the wolves met each other rodolfo and his companions with their faces muffled in their cloaks stared rudely and insolently at the mother the daughter and the servant maid
in spite of all their tenderness her anguish was too poignant to be soon allayed and from that fatal night she continued to live the life of a recluse under the protection of her parents
the boy having embraced his mother calling her his cousin and his grandmother calling her his benefactress repeated his grandfathers question
but as the proverb says with the disease god sends the remedy
whoever thou art she exclaimed suddenly seizing rodolfos hand if thy soul is capable of pity grant me one prayer having deprived me of honour now deprive me of life
there was in that city a young cavalier about two and twenty years of age whom wealth high birth a wayward disposition inordinate indulgence and profligate companions impelled to do things which disgraced his rank
the father and mother rodolfo and his two companions had already seated themselves when dona estafania said in an off hand way sinner that i am how well i behave to my guest
the gentleman who had humanely taken charge of him being of eminent rank and well known they easily found their way to his house and arrived there just as luis was under the surgeons hands
luis was out of danger in a fortnight in a month he rose from his bed and during all that time he was visited daily by his mother and grandmother and treated by the master and mistress of the house as if he was their own child
the season being winter she was dressed in a robe and train of black velvet with gold and pearl buttons her girdle and necklace were of diamonds her head was uncovered and the shining braids and ringlets of her thick chestnut hair spangled with diamonds dazzled the eyes of the beholders
she reflected how near she stood to the crisis which was to determine whether she was to be blessed or unhappy for ever and racked by the intensity of her emotions she suddenly changed colour her head dropped and she fell forward in a swoon into the arms of the dismayed estafania
they had not undressed or thought of taking any rest
this truth which i have learned from her lips is confirmed by his face in which we have both beheld that of our son
am i in bed
what she had thus done voluntarily at first she found herself in a few months constrained to do by necessity for she discovered that she was pregnant to the grievous renewal of her affliction
as for high birth thank heaven and my ancestors i am well enough off in that respect as for understanding provided a woman is neither a dolt nor a simpleton there is no need of her having a very subtle wit in point of wealth i am amply provided by my parents but beauty is what i covet with no other addition than virtue and good breeding
but you must also swear not to follow me or make any attempts to ascertain my name or that of my family who if they were as wealthy as they are noble would not have to bear patiently such insult in my person
the four grandparents wept for joy there was not a corner of the house but was full of gladness and though night was hurrying on with her swift black wings it seemed to rodolfo that she did not fly but hobble on crutches so great was his impatience to be alone with his beloved bride
the window was large and protected by a stout iron grating it looked out on a garden surrounded by high walls so that escape in that direction was as impossible as by the door
the lady of the house spoke to the same effect and with no less kindness and cordiality
they were afraid to appeal for justice to the laws lest thereby they should only publish their daughters disgrace besides though well born they were poor and had not the means of commanding influence and favour and above all they knew not the name of their injurer or of whom or what to complain but their luckless stars
in mercy kill me this moment
but rodolfo had been struck by the great beauty of leocadia the hidalgos daughter and presently he began to entertain the idea of enjoying it at all hazards
mother dear father do you hear me
she earnestly entreated them to tell her if they remembered that her son had carried off a young woman on such a night so many years ago for the honour and the peace of mind of all his relations depended on their knowing the truth of that matter
just then leocadia came to herself and embracing the cross seemed changed into a sea of tears and the gentleman remained in utter bewilderment until his wife had repeated to him from beginning to end leocadias whole story and he believed it through the blessed dispensation of heaven which had confirmed it by so many convincing testimonies
having come to this resolution he hastened back to remove leocadia before daylight appeared which would compel him to keep her in his room all the following day
the gentleman replied that there was nothing to thank him for the fact being that when he saw the boy knocked down his first thought was that he saw under the horses heels the face of a son of his own whom he tenderly loved
for this and other reasons rodolfo readily complied with the wishes of his father who gave him ample letters of credit on barcelona genoa rome and naples
if my wife brings me this i will thank heaven for the gift and make my parents happy in their old age
the news speedily reached the ears of his grandparents and his supposed cousin who all hurried in wild dismay to look for their darling
rodolfos two comrades proposed to take leave of him at once and retire to their own homes but estafania would not suffer them to depart for their presence was needful for the execution of a scheme she had in her head
to baffle any spies that might perchance be watching her she entered a house which she found open and by and by she went from it to her own where she found her parents stupefied with grief
it was nearly night when rodolfo arrived and whilst preparations were making for supper estafania took her sons companions aside believing that they were two of the three whom leocadia mentioned as having been with rodolfo on the night of her abduction
dona estafania the kind gentlemans wife often observed in conversation with leocadia that the boy so strongly resembled a son of hers who was in italy she never could look at him without thinking her son was actually before her
it is the only amends i ask of you for the wrong you have done me
once when i recovered from a swoon replied leocadia i found myself senor in your arms without honour but for that i have had full compensation since on my recovery from my this days swoon i found myself in the same arms but honoured
you may wonder to hear me speak thus being so young
she found the door but it was locked outside
burning with the thirst of personal revenge sheriff jones now accused the town of lawrence of the violation of law involved in this rescue though the people of lawrence immediately and earnestly disavowed the act
with such a radical opposition of sentiment both factions were on the alert to seize every available vantage ground
he ordered the forces to disband prisoners were liberated and with the opportune aid of a furious rain storm the border ruffian army gradually melted away
the free state men clung to their prairie towns and prairie ravines with all the obstinacy and courage of true defenders of their homes and firesides
all the territorial dignitaries were present governor shannon presided john calhoun the surveyor general made the principal speech a denunciation of the abolitionists supporting the topeka movement chief justice lecompte dignified the occasion with approving remarks
the military force partly rabble partly organized had meanwhile moved into the town
his reception speech at westport in which he maintained the legality of the legislature and his determination to enforce their laws delighted his pro slavery auditors
organized and sustained in the beginning by voluntary contributions from that and distant states they ended by levying forced contributions by pressing horses food or arms from any neighborhood they chanced to visit
i have reason to believe wrote one of their prominent men that before to morrow morning the black flag will be hoisted when nine out of ten will rally round it and march without orders upon lawrence
we may have said that we would assist any proper officer in the service of any legal process they replied standing upon their interpretation
in this incident contrasting the creative and the destructive spirit of the factions the emigrant aid society of massachusetts finds its most honorable and triumphant vindication
neither party was willing to yield honestly nor ready to fight manfully
meanwhile a sober second thought had come to governor shannon
this was a formidable array of advantages slavery was playing with loaded dice
atchison who had been haranguing the mob planted his two guns before the building and trained them upon it
the firm defensive attitude of the people of lawrence had produced its effect
the irregular border ruffian squads were hastily incorporated into the skeleton kansas militia the posse became some two thousand strong and the defenders of lawrence perhaps one thousand
the free state hotel a stone building in dimensions fifty by seventy feet three stories high and handsomely furnished previously occupied only for lodging rooms on that day for the first time opened its table accommodations to the public and provided a free dinner in honor of the occasion
buford of alabama titus of florida wilkes of virginia hampton of kentucky treadwell of south carolina and others brought not only enthusiastic leadership but substantial assistance both the factions which had come so near to actual battle in the wakarusa war though nominally disbanded in reality continued their military organizationsthe free state men through apprehension of danger the border ruffians because of their purpose to crush out opposition
the missouri cabal on the other hand having three of their best men constantly at the governors side were compelled to recognize their lack of justification
the bogus legislature numbered thirty six members
the vague and double meaning phrases of the lawrence agreement furnished the earliest causes of a renewal of the quarrel
there was no doubt of the earnestness of their purpose
the truce patched up by this lawrence treaty was of comparatively short duration
the inmates being removed at the appointed hour a few cannon balls were fired through the stone walls
from these again sprang barricaded and fortified dwellings camps and scouting parties finally culminating in roving guerrilla bands half partisan half predatory
they were not only well armed and supplied but wrought up to the highest pitch of partisan excitement
alarm being given bransons free state neighbors already exasperated at the murder rose under the sudden instinct of self protection and rescued branson from the sheriff and his posse that same night though without other violence than harsh words
yankee ingenuity had invented a new kind of breech loading gun called sharps rifle it was in fact the best weapon of its day
now is the time to show game and if we are defeated this time the territory is lost to the south said the leaders
two abortive imitations of the missouri blue lodges set on foot during the summer by the free state men provoked by the election invasion in march furnished them a starting point for military organization
during and after the contest over the speakership at washington each state legislature became a forum of kansas debate
the free state men had only their convictions their intelligence their courage and the moral support of the north the conspiracy had its secret combination the territorial officials the legislature the bogus laws the courts the militia officers the president and the army
all dissent all non compliance all hesitation all mere silence even were in their stronghold towns like leavenworth branded as abolitionism declared to be hostility to the public welfare and punished with proscription personal violence expulsion and frequently death
their assumed character changed with their changing opportunities or necessities
the forces of the lecompton camp fully understand the plot and will fight under the same banner
but he added with a significant oath boys we will fight some time thirteen of the captains in the wakarusa camp were called together and the situation was duly explained
the governor on his part becoming doubtful of the legality of employing missouri militia to enforce kansas laws was also eager to secure the help of federal troops sheriff jones began to grow importunate
the united states arsenal at liberty missouri was broken into and stripped of its contents to supply cannon small arms and ammunition
half an hour later turning a deaf ear to all remonstrance he gave the proprietors until five oclock to remove their families and personal property from the free state hotel
to these an urgent appeal for help was made and the leaders of the conspiracy in prompt obedience placarded the frontier with inflammatory handbills and collected and equipped companies and hurried them forward to the rendezvous without a moments delay
there were similar murmurs in the pro slavery camps
ten days were consumed in these negotiations but the spirit of vengeance refused to yield
to embarrass this damaging exposure judge lecompte issued a writ against the ex governor on a frivolous charge of contempt
in a few days an officer came with a requisition from governor shannon and took the prisoner by land to westport and afterwards from there to kansas city and leavenworth
with this peace warrant in his pocket but without showing or reading it to his prisoner sheriff jones and a posse of twenty five border ruffians proceeded to bransons house at midnight and arrested him
opportunely for them about this time governor shannon appointed to succeed reeder arrived in the territory
the governor refused to interfere to protect the threatened town though an urgent appeal to do so was made to him by its citizens who after stormy and divided councils resolved on a policy of non resistance
relocated footnote governor robinson being on his way east the steamboat on which he was traveling stopped at lexington missouri
in the missouri camp while the leaders became alarmed the men grew insubordinate
coming by way of the missouri river towns he fell first among border ruffian companionship and influences and perhaps having his inclinations already molded by his washington instructions his early impressions were decidedly adverse to the free state cause
he continued his pretended search and to give color to his errand made two arrests
ex governor reeder was in attendance on this committee supplying data pointing out from personal knowledge sources of information cross examining witnesses to elicit the hidden truth
one of his militia generals suggested that the governor should require the outlaws at lawrence and elsewhere to surrender the sharps rifles another wrote asking him to call out the government troops at fort leavenworth
the missouri backwoods men manifested an almost incredible interest in this wonderful gun
but the affair was magnified as a crowning proof that the free state men were insurrectionists and outlaws
they on the other hand professing no purpose but that of defense and self protection were obliged to permit free and constant ingress to their beleaguered town
the leaders of the conspiracy became distrustful of their power to crush the town
the people of lawrence denounced the deed but the sheriff hoarded up the score for future revenge
the free state men shrank from forcible resistance to even bogus laws
this was of course the original controversyslavery burning to enforce her usurpation freedom determined to defend her birthright
he hastened to lawrence which now invoked his protection
the free state hotel served as barracks
the murderer a pro slavery man first fled to missouri but returned to shawnee mission and sought the official protection of sheriff jones no warrant no examination no commitment followed and the criminal remained at large
a border ruffian foray against the town was hastily organized
of the lynchings the mobs and the murders it would be impossible except in a very extended work to note the frequent and atrocious details
the general public interest in the controversy was shown by discussions carried on by press pulpit and in the daily conversation and comment of the people of the union in every town hamlet and neighborhood
on one point especially the border ruffians had a wholesome dread
while the governors proclamation spoke of serving writs the notices of the conspirators sounded the note of the real contest
with the advantage of its defensive position lawrence was as strong as the sheriffs mob
president pierce in his special message of january twenty fourth declared what had been done by the topeka movement to be of a revolutionary character which would become treasonable insurrection if it reach the length of organized resistance
no posse was summoned no further effort made and reeder fearing personal violence soon fled in disguise
they could see that a conflict meant serious results
this was at the march election eighteen fifty five
governor robinson and colonel lane were appointed to command
sheriff jones made several visits unmolested on their part and without any display of writs or demand for the surrender of alleged offenders on his own
he directed his militia generals to repress disorder and check any attack on the town interviews were held with the free state commanders and the situation was fully discussed
among other instrumentalities for executing the bogus laws the bogus legislature had appointed one samuel j jones sheriff of douglas county kansas territory although that individual was at the time of his appointment and long afterwards united states postmaster of the town of westport missouri
one additional incident served to precipitate the crisis
they might be deaf to the equalities proclaimed in the declaration of independence or blind to the moral sin of slavery but they comprehended a rifle which could be fired ten times a minute and kill a man at a thousand yards
a propitious moment for carrying it out seemed now to have arrived
civil war in kansas
they next made application to the marshal who tauntingly replied that he could not rely on their pledges and must take the liberty to execute his process in his own time and manner
out of this incident the officious sheriff managed most ingeniously to create an embroilment with the town of lawrence buckley who was alleged to have been accessory to the crime obtained a peace warrant against branson a neighbor of the victim
the free state officers and leaders were thanks to judge lecomptes doctrine of constructive treason under indictment arrest or in flight the settlers were busy with their spring crops while the pro slavery guerrillas freshly arrived and full of zeal were eager for service and distinction
they were squads of kansas militia companies of peaceful emigrants or gangs of irresponsible outlaws to suit the chance the whim or the need of the moment
the people of lawrence without any great difficulty obtained daily information concerning the hostile camps
their distinctive characters however display one broad and unfailing difference
for general service therefore requiring no special effort the numerical strength of the factions was about equal while on extraordinary occasions the two thousand border ruffian reserve lying a little farther back from the state line could at any time easily turn the scale
during the forenoon the deputy marshal rode leisurely into the town attended by less than a dozen men being neither molested nor opposed he summoned half a dozen citizens to join his posse who followed obeyed and assisted him
they consented to a compromise to cover a retreat
the governor was denounced as a traitor and sheriff jones declared that he would have wiped out lawrence atchison on the contrary sustained the bargain explaining that to attack lawrence under the circumstances would ruin the democratic cause
the bogus laws having been enacted and the free state men having at the big springs convention resolved on the failure of peaceable remedies to resist them to a bloody issue the conspiracy was not slow to cover itself and its projects with the sacred mantle of authority
the marshal and his posse including sheriff jones went among other invited guests and enjoyed the proffered hospitality
faithful to their legislative declaration they knew but one issue slavery
that summers emigration however being mainly from the free states greatly changed the relative strength of the two parties
little by little however the latter became hemmed and bound in the meshes of the various devices and proceedings which the territorial officials evolved from the bogus laws
the pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain
thus they seem to constitute more than the mere furniture of the mind they form as it were almost a part of the structure itself
you have made a lifelong change if not in the very structure at least in the permanent furnishing of her mind and performed a work that can never by any possibility be undone
every story therefore which you relate to a child to exemplify the principles of justice or goodness takes its place or rather the impression which it makes takes its place as one of the elements out of which the ideas that are to govern his future life are formed
every strong impression which you make upon his perceptive powers must have a very lasting influence and even the impression itself may in some cases be forever indelible
we can not surrender this trust
they are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood
the images which have been awakened in her mind the emotions connected with them and the effect of these images and emotions upon her faculties of imagination and conception will infuse a life into them which will make her in respect to this aspect of her spiritual nature a different being as long as she lives
conclusion
for the ideas and generalizations thus mainly formed from the images and impressions received in childhood become in later years the elements of the machinery so to speak by which all his mental operations are performed
mary your father and i are going out to ride this afternoon and i am going to explain it all to you why you can not go too
she brings down her bonnet and shawl by stealth and before the chaise comes to the door she sends mary out into the garden with her sister under pretense of showing her a birds nest which is not there trusting to her sisters skill in diverting the childs mind and amusing her with something else in the garden until the chaise has gone
in respect to her statement that she was going to the doctors it may or may not have been true
one
the three modes of management
then if she observes any expression of discontent or insubmission in marys countenance the mother would add
a child even who has become once accustomed to them will soon drop them if she finds owing to a change in the system of management that they now never succeed
they are
three
you love mamma i am sure and wish to have her get well soon so you will be a good girl i know and not make any trouble but will stay at home contentedlywont you
there are three different modes of management customarily employed by parents as means of inducing their children to comply with their requirements
and a child who never from the beginning finds any efficiency in them never learns to employ them at all
the object of this work is accordingly not to show how the gentle methods which will be brought to view can be employed as a substitute for such authority but how they can be made to aid in establishing and maintaining it
by the third method the mother secures the compliance of the child by a direct exercise of authority
government by manoeuvring and artifice
those children only attempt to carry their points by noisy and violent demonstrations who find by experience that such measures are usually successful
but the influences secured by these means form at the best but a sandy foundation for filial obedience to rest upon
the mother in managing the case in this way relies partly on convincing the reason of the child and partly on an appeal to her affection
by authority
as the chaise drives away mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the door step her mind in a tumult of excitement in which hatred of the doctor distrust and suspicion of her mother disappointment vexation and ill humor surge and swell among those delicate organizations on which the structure and development of the soul so closely dependdoing perhaps an irreparable injury
many mothers manage their children by means of tricks and contrivances more or less adroit designed to avoid direct issues with them and to beguile them as it were into compliance with their wishes
by reason and affection
to suppose that the object of this work is to aid in effecting such a substitution as that is entirely to mistake its nature and design
why cant you take me asks mary
i can not tell you why now replies the mother but perhaps i will explain it to you after i come home
then i shall love you and your papa will love you and after i get well we will take you to ride with us some day
the theory of many mothers is that they must govern their children by the influence of reason and affection
mary your father and i are going out to ride this afternoon and i am sorry for your sake that we can not take you with us
there said she pointing to the playthings see all your playthings left out
i would not have them know that their mothers leave their playthings about in that way for any consideration
but being addressed to the dolls they would be greatly interested in it and would listen with the utmost attention and there is no doubt that the counsels and instructions which she gave made a much stronger impression upon their minds than if they had been addressed directly to the children themselves to give an idea of these conversations i will report one of them in full
delia was accustomed to use the dolls not only for the purpose of instruction but sometimes for reproof in many ingenious ways
and you dont look very well now
put these playthings all away quick and carefully and we will not let them know any thing about your leaving them out
they were now playing with their dolls in the parlor
besides dressing and undressing them and playing take them out to excursions and visits they used to talk with them a great deal and give them much useful and valuable information and instruction
to such persons these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will or rather of yielding to their influence are specially useful
this book may perhaps sometimes fall into the hands of persons who have temporarily or otherwise the charge of young children without any absolute authority over them or any means or even any right to enforce their commands as was the case in fact with the older brothers or sister referred to in the preceding illustrations
they would think that they might do so too and that would make you a great deal of trouble
how do you do my children she said on one such occasion
nothing more was necessary except to shake up the mixture in order to facilitate the process of solution and the medicine was ready
for instance one day the children had been playing upon the piazza with blocks and other playthings and finally had gone into the house leaving all the things on the floor of the piazza instead of putting them away in their places as they ought to have done
there is a secretsomething i would not have them know on any account
now delia contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendency over the minds of the children by means of these dolls
and this method of treating the case was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any direct rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been
ah said della in a tone of great concern and looking again at andella i heard that you had been sick
della and the dolls
if delia had attempted to give precisely the same lecture to the children themselves they would very soon have become restless and uneasy and it would have made very little impression upon them
i observe that when you both wish for the same thing you dont quarrel for it and try to pull it away from one another but one waits like a lady until the other has done with it
put them away quick before andella and rosalie see them
i want you to come with me
so saying she led the way on tiptoe followed by the children out of the room and round by a circuitous route to the piazza
such persons may be interested in the manner in which delia made use of the childrens dolls as a means of guiding and governing their little mothers
you will have a very pleasant time i am sure because you never quarrel
if you can lead children to cure themselves of their faults in such a way that they shall have a good time in doing it there is a double gain
then turning to jane she asked in a somewhat altered tone has she been a good girl jane
you have come andella andella was the name of janes doll to make rosalie a visit
i am very glad
so the children went to work with great alacrity and put the playthings all away
how nice you look
besides a scolding would have made them unhappy and this did not make them unhappy at all it amused and entertained them
well but now said the princess and she filled his pockets with cakes and put her own heavy gold chain around his neck and bent down and kissed him
and so he did
but when one has a fine red cap with a blue tassel one is too fine to ride on peat loads and anders trotted proudly by
he only shook his head
he knew well enough that mothers cap was the best cap in all the world
he cuddled up to his mother and asked
i am going to the court ball answered anders
he smiled when he saw anders in the gilt chair
and it is made of mothers best yarn and she knitted it herself and everybody wants to get it away from me
then anders felt brave again
lets swap caps he said and i will give you my jack knife to boot
the first person he met was a farm labourer walking alongside a load of peat and smacking at his horse
he made a bow so deep that his back came near breaking and he was dumbfounded i can tell you when he saw it was nobody but anders
but his mother hugged him close
if you dressed in silk and gold from top to toe you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap
seeing that i am so fine i may as well go and visit the king
anders did not answer
when she became aware of anders and the soldiers she walked over to them
but he had his cap he still held on to it with both hands as he rushed into his mothers cottage
on huge silver platters were pyramids of tarts and cakes and red wine sparkled in glittering decanters
once upon a time there was a little boy called anders who had a new cap
then the doors were thrown open and the king entered with a large suite of gentlemen in glittering uniforms and plumed hats
mother was i stupid
he darted like an arrow through all the halls down all the stairs and across the yard
but surely you would like to change caps with me said the king and raised his large heavy gold crown from his head
and a prettier cap you never could see for mother herself had knitted it and nobody could make anything quite as nice as mother could
and all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open
the princess sat down under a blue canopy with bouquets of roses and she let anders sit in a golden chair by her side
dear me he said if i did not think it was the gracious little count himself and then he invited anders to ride on the peat load
but when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a kings golden crown he said that anders was a stupid
so it is said anders
for like as not they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap
now this knife was a splendid one though half the blade was gone and the handle was a little cracked and anders knew that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jack knife
the princess certainly was beautiful and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any condition
he sat as before and held on to his red cap which everybody was so anxious to get
but anders cared nothing about that
that is a very fine cap you have he said
and then he said good bye to lars with a nod but lars only made faces at him for he was very much put out because he could not cheat anders out of his cap which his mother had made
he put his hands in his trousers pockets and went out for a walk for he did not begrudge anybodys seeing how fine he was
he was such a big boy that he wore high boots and carried a jack knife he gazed and gazed at the cap and could not keep from fingering the blue tassel
well well give it to me said the princess and i will give you a kiss
she called him a little gentleman and said that he was so fine that he might go to the royal court ball
but just at this instant the princess came tripping across the yard she was dressed in white silk with bows of ribbon
his brothers and sisters walked about squinting at him and their faces grew long with envy
he ran so fast that the princesss necklace fell off his neck and all the cakes jumped out of his pockets
in the palace yard stood two soldiers with shining helmets and with muskets over their shoulders and when anders came both the muskets were levelled at him
oh she said he has such an extraordinarily fine cap on his head that that will do just as well as a uniform
but you must not eat with your cap on your head she said and was going to take it off
with one jump anders got out of his chair
he twisted himself like an eel between the outstretched arms of the courtiers and over the soldiers muskets he jumped like a little rabbit
that he had not thought of
at the turn of the road he ran up against the tanners boy lars
where may you be going asked one of the soldiers
yes why not thought anders
and his mother took him up in her lap and he told her all his adventures and how everybody wanted his cap
indeed you are not said the other soldier and put his foot forward
at the farther end of the largest hall a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rows
he hated everything like slavery and as young as he was he had already made five attempts to escape
i never knew of but one man who could ever please him
julius had been kept in the dark in maryland but on free soil the light rushed in upon his astonished vision to a degree almost bewildering
he worked me very hard he wanted to be beating me all the time
the treatment that had been meted out to them was about as tolerant as slavery could well afford and the physical condition of the passengers bore evidence that they had been used to something better than herring and corn cake for a diet
i was afraid of being overtaken on the way he fled from near baltimore where he left brothers and other relatives in chains
these were specimens of the inner workings of the peculiar institution john however had not only observed slavery from a domestic stand point he had also watched master and mistress abroad as visitors and guests in other peoples houses noticed not only how they treated white people but also how they treated black people
john wesley was thirty two years of age of a lively turn pleasant countenance dark color and ordinary size
julius who was successful enough to bring his wife and boy with him was a wonderful specimen of muscular proportions
in his review allusion was made not only to his master but also to his mistress in which he said that she was a quarrelsome and crabbed woman middling stout in order to show a reason why he left as he did he stated that there had been a fuss two or three times previous to the escape and it had been rumored that somebody would have to be sold soon
julius color was nearly jet black and his speech was very good considering his lack of book learning his bearing was entirely self possessed and commendable
julius smith wife mary and boy james henry and edward smith and jack christy
arrival from maryland eighteen fifty eight
i always had it in my mind to leave but i was jubus dubious of starting
j b parletts advertisement gave his views of the man who had enslaved him
a few years back one of their slaves a coachman was kept on the coach box one cold night when they were out at a ball until he became almost frozen to death in fact he did die in the infirmary from the effects of the frost about one week afterwards
nor was he all muscle by a great deal he was well balanced as to mother wit and shrewdness
of this party edward a boy of seventeen called forth much sympathy he too was claimed by hollan
another case was that of a slave woman in a very delicate state who was one day knocked down stairs by mrs johnson herself and in a few weeks after the poor woman died from the effects of the injury thus received
when asked what first prompted him to seek his freedom he replied oh my senses
two thousand dollars rewardran away from the subscriber living on the york turnpike eight miles from baltimore city on sunday april eleventh my negro man jacob aged twenty years five feet ten inches high chestnut color spare made good features
i didnt know the way to come
the mistress professed to know nothing about it simply said she went to sleep and fell out herself as usual nothing was done in the way of punishment
the revelations made by these passengers were painful to listen to and would not have been credited if any room had existed for doubt
it is hardly necessary to say more of them here
i will give fifty dollars reward if taken in baltimore city or county and two hundred dollars if taken out of the state and secured in jail so that i get him again
henry was about twenty three years of age of an active turn brown skin and had given the question of freedom his most serious attention as his actions proved
while this party was very respectable in regard to numbers and enlisted much sympathy still they had no wounds or bruises to exhibit or very hard reports to make relative to their bondage
although a young man of but twenty five he weighed two hundred and twenty five pounds he was tall and well formed from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet
as to advertising him john gave it as his opinion that they would be ashamed to do it from the fact that they had already rendered themselves more notorious than they had bargained for on account of their cruelty towards their slaves they were wealthy and courted the good opinion of society
these johnsons thought that they were first rate to their servants
on this occasion with older and wiser heads he succeeded
for instance jacob taylor was noticed on the record book as being twenty three years of age and the name of his master was entered as william pollit but as jacob had never been allowed to learn to read he might have failed in giving a correct pronunciation of the name
j b parlett
besides they were members of the presbyterian church and john thought that they were very willing that people should believe that they were great saints
with johns intelligence large observation good memory and excellent natural abilities with the amount of detail that he possessed nothing more would have been needed for a thrilling book than the facts and incidents of slave life as he had been conversant with it under the johnsons in maryland
his wife and boy shared fully in his affections and seemed well pleased to have their faces turned canada ward
from the manner in which he expressed himself with regard to robert hollan no man in the whole range of his recollections will be longer remembered than he his enthralment while under hollan will hardly ever be forgotten
that his master was a man of means and pretty high standingjulius thought was not much to his credit since they were obtained from unpaid labor
this was what did the mischief so far as the running away was concerned
conseil was my manservant
there the katrin ferry transferred men horses and carriage to brooklyn that great new york annex located on the left bank of the east river and in a few minutes we arrived at the wharf next to which the abraham lincoln was vomiting torrents of black smoke from its two funnels
commander farragut
theyll feed it during our absence
but conseil had one flaw
go ahead then commander farragut called
what master does ill do conseil replied
conseil appeared
whatever detour master wishes
its a glorious mission but also a dangerous one
the hotel elevator dropped us off in the main vestibule on the mezzanine i went down a short stair leading to the ground floor i settled my bill at that huge counter that was always under siege by a considerable crowd
but now nothing could hold me back i forgot everything else and without another thought of exhaustion friends or collections i accepted the american governments offer
a route slightly less direct thats all were leaving on the abraham lincoln
a quarter of an hour later our trunks were ready
a devoted lad who went with me on all my journeys a gallant flemish boy whom i genuinely liked and who returned the compliment a born stoic punctilious on principle habitually hardworking rarely startled by lifes surprises very skillful with his hands efficient in his every duty and despite his having a name that means counsel never giving advice not even the unsolicited kind
well deal with them later
besides i mused all roads lead home to europe and our unicorn may be gracious enough to take me toward the coast of france
pack as much into my trunk as you can my traveling kit my suits shirts and socks dont bother counting just squeeze it all inand hurry
three seconds after reading this letter from the honorable secretary of the navy i understood at last that my true vocation my sole purpose in life was to hunt down this disturbing monster and rid the world of it
get my things ready get yours ready were departing in two hours
what about masters live babirusa
as master thinks best conseil replied placidly
what about masters collections conseil ventured to observe
professor pierre aronnax he said to me
for the past ten years conseil had gone with me wherever science beckoned
conseil i called in an impatient voice
there was good reason to stop and think even for the worlds most emotionless man what would conseil say
did master summon me he said entering
i left instructions for shipping my containers of stuffed animals and dried plants to paris france
i asked for commander farragut
these beasts can be quite unpredictable
the hotel will keep them for us
were going to rid the seas of it the author of a two volume work in quarto on the mysteries of the great ocean depths has no excuse for not setting sail with commander farragut
your cabin is waiting for you
aye sir the engineer replied
anyhow well leave instructions to ship the whole menagerie to france
at this order which was relayed to the engine by means of a compressed air device the mechanics activated the startup wheel steam rushed whistling into the gaping valves
conseil i called a third time
then we arent returning to paris conseil asked
conseil i repeated while feverishly beginning my preparations for departure
what
are we up to pressure he asked the man
the archaeotherium hyracotherium oreodonts cheiropotamus and masters other fossil skeletons
three oclock then sounded
the lad was thirty years old and his age to that of his employer was as fifteen is to twenty
i opened a line of credit sufficient to cover the babirusa and conseil at my heels i jumped into a carriage
chapter three
with all due respect to master conseil replied as comfortable as a hermit crab inside the shell of a whelk
the same i replied
i left conseil to the proper stowing of our luggage and climbed on deck to watch the preparations for getting under way
i wanted nothing more than to see my country again my friends my modest quarters by the botanical gardens my dearly beloved collections
in person
our baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate i rushed aboard
oh its nothing really
we havent a moment to lose
yes my boy
it was a highspeed frigate furnished with superheating equipment that allowed the tension of its steam to build to seven atmospheres
from rubbing shoulders with scientists in our little universe by the botanical gardens the boy had come to know a thing or two in conseil i had a seasoned specialist in biological classification an enthusiast who could run with acrobatic agility up and down the whole ladder of branches groups classes subclasses orders families genera subgenera species and varieties but there his science came to a halt
i bowed and letting the commander attend to getting under way i was taken to the cabin that had been set aside for me
the wharves of brooklyn and every part of new york bordering the east river were crowded with curiosity seekers departing from five hundred thousand throats three cheers burst forth in succession thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses hailing the abraham
even so i had just returned from an arduous journey exhausted and badly needing a rest
as master wishes
he summoned his engineer
under this pressure the abraham lincoln reached an average speed of eighteen point three miles per hour a considerable speed but still not enough to cope with our gigantic cetacean
the abraham lincoln had been perfectly chosen and fitted out for its new assignment
welcome aboard professor
never did he object to buckling up his suitcase for any country whatever china or the congo no matter how far off it was he went here there and everywhere in perfect contentment moreover he enjoyed excellent health that defied all ailments owned solid muscles but hadnt a nerve in him not a sign of nerves the mental type i mean
yes we are certainly i replied evasively but after we make a detour
lincoln until it reached the waters of the hudson river at the tip of the long peninsula that forms new york city
conseil did them in a flash and i was sure the lad hadnt missed a thing because he classified shirts and suits as expertly as birds and mammals
we dont know where it will take us
three seconds before the arrival of j b hobsons letter i no more dreamed of chasing the unicorn than of trying for the northwest passage
to be sure i had confidence in this devoted lad
as master wishes
the escort of boats and tenders still followed the frigate and only left us when we came abreast of the lightship whose two signal lights mark the entrance of the narrows to upper new york bay
he was a fanatic on formality and he only addressed me in the third personto the point where it got tiresome
knot one point one five miles per hour
hectare roughly two point five acres
but in the eighteen sixties france had to treat the tsar as an ally and vernes publisher pierre hetzel pronounced the book unprintable verne reworked its political content devising new nationalities for nemo and his great enemyinformation revealed only in a later novel the mysterious island eighteen seventy five in the present work nemos background remains a dark secret
yet this loose structure gives the novel an air of documentary realism
other subtleties occur inside each episode the textures sparkling with wit information and insight
meter roughly one yard three inches
even the supporting cast is shrewdly drawn professor aronnax the career scientist caught in an ethical conflict conseil the compulsive classifier who supplies humorous tag lines for vernes fast facts the harpooner ned land a creature of constant appetites man as heroic animal
fathom six feet
but with verne the operative word is travel and some of his best known titles dont really qualify as scifi around the world in eighty days eighteen seventy two and michael strogoff eighteen seventy six are closer to travelogs adventure yarns in far away places
the deepest parts of the ocean are totally unknown to us admits professor aronnax early in this novel
like shakespeares king lear he courts death and madness in a great storm then commits mass murder collapses in catatonic paralysis and suicidally runs his ship into the oceans most dangerous whirlpool hate swallows him whole
one hundred degrees centigrade equals boiling water
of the earth features travel to the earths core
first as a paris stockbroker later as a celebrated author and yachtsman he went on frequent voyages to britain america the mediterranean
true todays scientists know a few things he didnt the south pole isnt at the waters edge but far inland sharks dont flip over before attacking giant squid sport ten tentacles not eight sperm whales dont prey on their whalebone cousins
verne is often dubbed in isaac asimovs phrase the worlds first science fiction writer and its true many of his sixty odd books do anticipate future events and technologies from the earth to the moon eighteen sixty five and hector servadac eighteen seventy seven deal in space travel while journey to the center
but much of the novels brooding power comes from captain nemo inventor musician renaissance genius hes a trail blazing creation the prototype not only for countless renegade scientists in popular fiction but even for such varied figures as sherlock holmes or wolf larsen
units of measure
these observations partly apply here
his specifications for an open sea submarine and a selfcontained diving suit were decades before their time yet modern technology bears them out triumphantly
and in this last action he falls into the classic sin of pride
the subtitle of the present book is an underwater tour of the world so in good travelog style the nautiluss exploits supply an episodic story line shark attacks giant squid cannibals hurricanes whale hunts and other rip roaring adventures erupt almost at random
however verne gives his heros brilliance and benevolence a dark undersidethe mans obsessive hate for his old enemy
league in vernes context two point one six miles

milligram roughly one twenty eight thousandth of an ounce
one hundred twenty six years later a time cover story on deepsea exploration made much the same admission we know more about mars than we know about the oceans this reality begins to explain the dark power and otherworldly fascination of twenty thousand leagues under the seas
initially vernes narrative was influenced by the eighteen sixty three uprising of poland against tsarist russia
millimeter roughly one twenty fifth of an inch

even in our era of satellite dishes and video games the seas keep their secrets
centigrade zero degrees centigrade equals freezing water
the poles were quashed with a violence that appalled not only verne but all europe
lastly the book has stature as a novel of character
thirty seven degrees centigrade equals human body temperature
because as that time cover story suggests we still havent caught up with verne
this compulsion leads nemo into ugly contradictions hes a fighter for freedom yet all who board his ship are imprisoned there for good he works to save lives both human and animal yet he himself creates a holocaust he detests imperialism yet he lays personal claim to the south pole
kilometer roughly six tenths of a mile

what goes on in those distant depths
this notwithstanding verne furnishes the most evocative portrayal of the ocean depths before the arrival of jacques cousteau and technicolor film
weve seen progress in sonar torpedoes and other belligerent machinery but sailors and scientists to say nothing of touristshave yet to voyage in a submarine with the luxury and efficiency of the nautilus
what creatures inhabit or could inhabit those regions twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the water its almost beyond conjecture
centimeter roughly two fifths of an inch
these unifying threads tighten the narrative and accelerate its momentum
the feeling of familiarity has all sorts of degrees down to the stage where we dimly feel that we have seen a person before
in the first place everything constituting a memory belief is happening now not in that past time to which the belief is said to refer
it might however have been expected that we should begin our discussion of knowledge with perception i e with that integral experience of things in the environment out of which sensation is extracted by psychological analysis
that is to say if we suppose that a is the event remembered b the remembering and t the interval of time between a and b there must be some characteristic of b which is capable of degrees and which in accurately dated memories varies as t varies it may increase as t increases or diminish as t increases
in an image of a wellknown face for example some parts may feel more familiar than others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts
the fact of past experience is essential in producing this filling out of sensation but not the recollection of past experience
and it is difficult to find any ground except a pragmatic one for supposing that memory is not sheer delusion if as seems to be the case there is not apart from memory any way of ascertaining that there really was a past occurrence having the required relation to our present remembering
there may be a specific feeling which could be called the feeling of pastness especially where immediate memory is concerned
the behaviourist who attempts to make psychology a record of behaviour has to trust his memory in making the record
in the second place images without beliefs are insufficient to constitute memory and habits are still more insufficient
this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory
thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone
when we see a cat we know it is a cat because of previous cats we have seen but we do not as a rule recollect at the moment any particular occasion when we have seen a cat
familiarity is a feeling capable of degrees
it might be suggested that vagueness is the required characteristic but i do not think this is the case
there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events
i think the characteristic by which we distinguish the images we trust is the feeling of familiarity that accompanies them
we may say then that images are regarded by us as more or less accurate copies of past occurrences because they come to us with two sorts of feelings one those that may be called feelings of familiarity two those that may be collected together as feelings giving a sense of pastness
one reason for treating memory at this early stage is that it seems to be involved in the fact that images are recognized as copies of past sensible experience
the non sensational elements in perception can be wholly explained as the result of habit produced by frequent correlations
it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present but it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events
they must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past
but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory habit is a very intrusive feature of our mental life and is often present where at first sight it seems not to be
semons two books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely
hence the occurrences which are called knowledge of the past are logically independent of the past they are wholly analysable into present contents which might theoretically be just what they are even if no past had existed
the definition of truth as the correspondence between beliefs and facts seems peculiarly evident in the case of memory as against not only the pragmatist definition but also the idealist definition by means of coherence
to begin with it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as i have seen this before than as this has existed before we recognize a thing it may be urged as having been in our experience before whatever that may mean we do not recognize it as merely having been in the world before
what results formally from our knowledge of the past through images of which we recognize the inaccuracy is that such images must have two characteristics by which we can arrange them in two series of which one corresponds to the more or less remote period in the past to which they refer and the other to our greater or less confidence in their accuracy
for their mere occurrence by itself would not suggest any connection with anything that had happened before
all that i am doing is to use its logical tenability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember
the sort of memory with which we are here concerned is the sort which is a form of knowledge
it seems clear that some of the things i remember are trivial and without any visible importance for the future but that my memory is true or false in virtue of a past event not in virtue of any future consequences of my belief
before considering true memory it will be well to consider two things which are on the way towards memory namely the feeling of familiarity and recognition
memory
a third point perhaps not quite so certain as our previous two is that the truth of memory cannot be wholly practical as pragmatists wish all truth to be
the fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it
similarly the performances of animals in getting out of cages or mazes to which they are accustomed do not prove that they remember having been in the same situation before arguments in favour of for example memory in plants are only arguments in favour of habit memory not of knowledge memory
in such a case we distrust our image in spite of its being unusually clear
in the present lecture i shall attempt the analysis of memory knowledge both as an introduction to the problem of knowledge in general and because memory in some form is presupposed in almost all other knowledge
the judgment that what is familiar has been experienced before is a product of reflection and is no part of the feeling of familiarity such as a horse may be supposed to have when he returns to his stable
of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition
how far our knowledge of the past is due to memory and how far to other sources is of course a matter to be investigated but there can be no doubt that memory forms an indispensable part of our knowledge of the past
memory which we are to consider to day introduces us to knowledge in one of its forms
but the rejection of the subject renders some more complicated theory necessary
a recent memory has usually more context than a more distant one
i think it is by this means that we become critical of images not by some imageless memory with which we compare them
there are occasions when familiarity does not attach itself to any definite object when there is merely a vague feeling that something is familiar
we recognize our friend jones we know cats and dogs when we see them and so on
remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered
i am not suggesting that the non existence of the past should be entertained as a serious hypothesis
like all sceptical hypotheses it is logically tenable but uninteresting
it is this sort of occurrence that constitutes the essence of memory until we have analysed what happens in such a case as this we have not succeeded in understanding memory
what is called perception differs from sensation by the fact that the sensational ingredients bring up habitual associatesimages and expectations of their usual correlatesall of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation
the analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the thirteenth lecture and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise
it is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge
if we had retained the subject or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple
this may be taken in two senses the first when a thing not merely feels familiar but we know it is such and such
it is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the wellknown illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time
sensation we decided is not a form of knowledge
it is important not to confuse the two forms of memory which bergson distinguishes in the second chapter of his matter and memory namely the sort that consists of habit and the sort that consists of independent recollection
they give laws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory
i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past
and the same applies to images
we will take the second of these points first
some images like some sensations feel very familiar while others feel strange
a further stage is recognition
we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word
one of these is context
i shall return to the consideration of familiarity shortly
we have this feeling normally in places where we have often been beforeat home or in wellknown streets
thus if i recognize a thing the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which i recognize it forms part of my experience by definition recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled out from the rest of the world
we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trustfor example under the influence of fatigue we may see a friends face vividly and clearly but horribly distorted
the first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past
the purely psychological problems which it raises are not very difficult though they have sometimes been rendered artificially obscure by unwillingness to admit the fallibility of the non sensational elements of perception
the study of any topic is like the continued observation of an object which is approaching us along a road what is certain to begin with is the quite vague knowledge that there is some object on the road
nevertheless in spite of the risk of error precision is the goal at which we must aim
a gramophone by the help of suitable records might relate to us the incidents of its past and people are not so different from gramophones as they like to believe
i shall speak of it as true memory to distinguish it from mere habit acquired through past experience
this knowledge is memory in one sense though in another it is not
it is not logically necessary to the existence of a memory belief that the event remembered should have occurred or even that the past should have existed at all
there is no logically necessary connection between events at different times therefore nothing that is happening now or will happen in the future can disprove the hypothesis that the world began five minutes ago
when we have once described the event the words we have used easily become habitual
it differs from the sense of familiarity by being cognitive it is a belief or judgment which the sense of familiarity is not
there is for example a habit of remembering a unique event
how then are we to find any way of comparing the present image and the past sensation
these considerations however are taking us away from psychology to which we must now return
i shall discuss this question in later lectures
in this way the whole status of images as copies is bound up with the analysis of memory
if we are to know as it is supposed we dothat images are copies accurate or inaccurate of past events something more than the mere occurrence of images must go to constitute this knowledge
most people and animals find it essential to their happiness to spend a good deal of their time in familiar surroundings which are especially comforting when any danger threatens
but i do not think such an inference is warranted
the recollection of a unique event cannot so bergson contends be wholly constituted by habit and is in fact something radically different from the memory which is habit
there is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago exactly as it then was with a population that remembered a wholly unreal past
the definition of my experience is difficult broadly speaking it is everything that is connected with what i am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory are among the most important
habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviourist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times
we often feel that something in our sensible environment is familiar without having any definite recollection of previous occasions on which we have seen it
the recollection alone is true memory
the question which of these occurs is not of any importance for the theoretic serviceability of the characteristic in question
to deal with this problem we must have a theory of memory
but apart from this there are other marks
and what sort of evidence is logically possible
some points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at
such modifications of humes principle however do not affect the problem which i wish to present for your consideration namely why do we believe that images are sometimes or always approximately or exactly copies of sensations
the second datum is that we certainly have more capacity for knowing the past than for knowing the future
very often our knowledge of the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present is inferred from its temporal relations to other remembered events
how is it possible to know that a memory image is an imperfect copy without having a more accurate copy by which to replace it
the difficulty of this question arises through the fact that the sensation which an image is supposed to copy is in the past when the image exists and can therefore only be known by memory while on the other hand memory of past sensations seems only possible by means of present images
this would seem to suggest that we have a way of knowing the past which is independent of images by means of which we can criticize image memories
recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more than a habit of association the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment
i am not sure that there is anything substantial in this point
we may even have used words to describe it to ourselves while it was happening in that case the habit of these words may fulfil the function of bergsons true memory while in reality it is nothing but habit memory
i do not wish to undertake the analysis of belief at present since it will be the subject of the twelfth lecture for the present i merely wish to emphasize the fact that recognition in our second sense consists in a belief which we may express approximately in the words this has existed before
it does not involve a definite memory of a definite past event but only the knowledge that something happening now is similar to something that happened before
what sort of evidence is there
nevertheless whatever a sceptic might urge in theory we cannot practically doubt that we got up this morning that we did various things yesterday that a great war has been taking place and so on
i can set to work now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this
here we have a definite influence of past experience but not necessarily any actual knowledge of the past
he gives the instance of learning a lesson by heart when i know it by heart i am said to remember it but this merely means that i have acquired certain habits on the other hand my recollection of say the second time i read the lesson while i was learning it is the recollection of a unique event which occurred only once
in like manner in the study of memory the certainties with which you begin are very vague and the more precise propositions at which you try to arrive are less certain than the hazy data from which you set out
our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image

she wandered in the land of clouds thro valleys dark listning dolors and lamentations waiting oft beside the dewy grave she stood in silence listning to the voices of the ground till to her own grave plot she came and there she sat down and heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow pit
why a tongue impressd with honey from every wind why an ear a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in why a nostril wide inhaling terror trembling and affright why a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire

you thought i had forgotten
venice
in a sunset glowing of crimson and gold she lies the glory of the world a beached kings galley whose sails are furled who is hung with tapestries rich and old
he had got into her courtyard she was alone that night through the black night rain he sang to her window bars
suddenly i was back in the old days before you felt we ought to drift apart it was some trickthe way your eyebrows raise
to war
your handssome vivid trifle
calm day with rollers
always the ships that move in mystery on the dim horizon shadow filled sails of dreams sliding over the blue grey ocean far from the rock edged shore where willow green waves are rushing and white foam people leap to stand erect for the moment
and still the sensitive silhouettes of the gondolas pass and leave no track light on the tides as lilies and black in the rippling waters of long sunsets
with a start then i remembered how i lived alone writing bad poems and eating out my heart
desperately immortal she she stands with wide hands dim through the veil of eternity behind the supreme door
a little pagan child god plays beyond the far horizon haze and underneath the twilight trees he blows a bubble to the breeze which is borne upward in the night and makes the heavens shine with light but soon it sinks to earth again and hitting hills it bursts
the other day at someones tea we met smiling gayly bowed and went our several ways complacent with successful coldnessyet
a good old tune she murmured and i found we were dancing
guided by you how we might stroll towards death our only music one anothers breath through gardens intimate with hollyhocks where silent poppies burn between the rocks by pools where birches bend to confidants above green waters scummed with lily plants
and then with foam the skies are splashed and sprayed and thats how all the stars are made
that was but rustling of dripping plants in the dark more tightly under his cloak he clasped his guitar
and when the fireflies mix their circling glow through the dark plants then gently might i know your lips light as the wings of the dragon flies
you are the star that made the skies all bright yet tore itself away in flaming flight you are the tree that suddenly awoke you are the rose that came to life and spoke
well i had although i never guessed i could forget those few great moments when we both went mad
there we might wander you and i alone through gardens filled with marble seats moss grown and fountainswater threads that winds disperse while in the spray the birds sit and converse
she was alone that night he had broken into her courtyard above the gurgling gutters he heard surely a door unchained
threnody
you thought i had forgotten
the music beats up the chasmed street then flares from around the curve the cheers break out from the waving crowd our soldiers march superb over the track lined city street the young men the grinning men pass
and ah that moon of silver sheen it is my heart hung in the sky and no clouds ever float between the grave flowers and my heart on high
phonographtango
thus walk i through my wonderland while all the evening is atune beneath the cypress trees that stand like candles to the barren moon
she is lain with high things and with low she lies with shut eyes rocked in the eternal flow of silence evermore
i do not read upon each stone the name that once was carven there i merely note new blossoms blown and breathe the perfume of the air
another band beats down the street contending rhythms clash new melodies win place then fade and the flashing legs move past down the cheering grey paved street the fringed flags the erect flags pass
the pleasant graveyard of my soul with sentimental cypress trees and flowers is filled that i may stroll in meditation at my ease
scuse me said trot i neglected to tell you that youre not the boolooroo any more
when the courtiers and the people assembled saw the goat they gave a great cheer for the beast had helped to dethrone their wicked ruler
guess id better send for him an tell him whats happened
all the rubbish was piled in the square before the palace and a bonfire made of it while the blue people clustered around and danced and sang with joy as the blue flames devoured the dreadful instrument that had once caused them so much unhappiness
then the room of the great knife was cleared of its awful furniture
all of sky island except the fog bank is now my kingdom so i welcome my faithful pinkies to my blue city where you are to be royally entertained and have a good time
when he finished she said cheerfully
he was looking downcast and sad and it was easy to see he was disappointed because he had not conquered the boolooroo himself
i escaped from the city because the boolooroo tried to patch me as you all know and the six snubnosed princesses tried to marry me which would have been a far greater misfortune
you wont be hurt answered the girl but youll have to find some other place to stay besides this palace an perhaps youll enjoy workin for a livin by way of variety
this was done the once royal family departing from the palace with shamed and downcast looks
im the boolooroo
no said trot positively theres been enough patching in this country and i wont have any more of it
the combined bands of both the countries played the music and a fine supper was served
not even a bird cage said she
you are mate replied the sailor
dont worry sizzle dear itll all come right pretty soon
hooray yelled the parrot
after they had eaten all they could and the servants had been sent away trot related her adventures telling how with the assistance of the billygoat she had turned the tables on the wicked boolooroo
wont you please get rid of them too your majesty
i think it will be best for us to go back to our own country as soon as possible suggested rosalie the witch for if we stay here very long the blueskins may rise against us and cause the pinkies much trouble
in this order they proceeded to the main gate which trot ordered the guards to throw wide open
but before i do that i want the privilege of patching the snubnosed princesses to each othermixing the six as much as possibleand then i want to patch the former boolooroo to the billygoat which is the same punishment he was going to inflict upon capn bill
cant they be discharged
however as the two forces came nearer together button bright spied trot and capn bill standing before the enemy and the sight astonished him considerably
ill gladly do that promised the new boolooroo and ill feed the honorable goat all the shavings and leather and tin cans he can eat besides the grass
the guards had a terrible struggle with the goat which was loose in the room and still wanted to fight but finally they subdued the animal and then they took the boolooroo out of the frame he was tied in and brought both him and the goat before queen trot who awaited them in the throne room of the palace
stop it said button bright i cant hear myself think
heres a pretty howdy do you havent any boolooroo
then she gave rosalie back her magic ring thanking the kind witch for all she had done for them
the former boolooroo groaned
it isnt a very pretty cabin and the furniture is cheap and common but im sure it is good enough for this wicked man and his family
the soldiers wore their best blue uniforms and were formed before the palace in marching order so trot and capn bill headed the procession and then came the soldiersall keeping stepand then the bands playing very loud noises on their instruments and finally the crowd of blue citizens waving flags and banners and shouting joyfully
ill always be queen of sky island but the pink and blue countries must each have a ruler
im nearly starved myself for this conquerin kingdoms is hard work
i have said no an i mean it answered the girl
then they all marched out a little way into the fields and found that the army of pinkies had already formed and was advancing steadily toward them
as they led the now famous animal from the room the boolooroo shuddered and said
and then he flapped his wings and barked like a dog with pure delight and added as fast as his birds tongue could speak
am i to be patched or what
you let the poor old boolooroo alone
but the people called upon him for a speech so he faced the blueskins and said
trot had listened carefully to the majordomos speech
when first they entered the throne room they tried to be as haughty and scornful as ever but the blues who were assembled there all laughed at them and jeered them for there was not a single person in all the blue country who loved the princesses the least little bit
it will be such a satisfaction
youre right capn she returned
how dare you people give orders in my palace
so the captain of the guards was given the key and told to fetch the boolooroo from the room of the great knife
hell look after this end of the island hereafter an unless im much mistaken hell do it a heap better than you did
ill have sizzle make a fine yard for the goat where hell have plenty of blue grass to eat
pinkies said she your queen has conquered the boolooroo and is now the queen of the blues
its my idee as hes braver than the whole blue army put together
cant i take any of the treasure with me he pleaded
the soldiers again rolled the frame in position having first pulled the great knife once more to the top of the derrick
youll take it easy cause you cant help yourself said capn bill what next queen trot
as soon as the soldiers return with tiggle said he
at once the goat gave a leap escaped from the soldiers and with bowed head rushed upon the boolooroo
suppose its a friend he suggested
when all was in readiness the king pulled the cord a second time and trot at the same instant pulled upon her rope
trot was horrified and wrung her little hands in sore perplexity for this was a most horrible fate that awaited her dear old friend
the room of the great knife was high and big and around it ran rows of benches for the spectators to sit upon
so capn bill held the boolooroo and the girl tied him fast in position as capn bill had been tied so that his majesty couldnt wiggle at all
they marched to their chairs and seated themselves to enjoy the cruel scene their father was about to enact and capn bill bowed to them politely and said
i wouldnt mind a cup o coffee myself said capn bill
the captain shook his head
everyone hates me and i dont object to that because i hate everybody
whats become of tiggle he shouted
splendid
villains he shouted go out and arrest the first living thing you meet and whoever it proves to be will be instantly patched to capn bill
dont mind him capn said trot but fetch him along to the frame
the poor queen by the way was seldom seen as she passed all her time playing solitaire with a deck that was one card short hoping that before she had lived her entire six hundred years she would win the game
some of the soldiers laughed too being tickled with the absurd notion and the six snubnosed princesses all sat up straight and permitted themselves to smile contemptuously
suddenly there was a noise in the corridor and evidence of scuffling and struggling
the idea of patching capn bill to a goat was vastly amusing to him and the more he thought of it the more he roared with laughter
as soon as they entered the room of the great knife the boolooroo gave a yell of disappointment
hold him steady in the frame and ill tie him up she replied
and in order that the slicing would be accurate there was another frame to which the prisoner was tied so that he couldnt wiggle either way
wheres tiggle
papa exclaimed turquoise angrily can you not prevent this vile earth being from addressing us
but while this was going on trot had crept up and fastened one end of her rope to the frame in which capn bill was confined
this frame was on rollers so that it could be placed directly underneath the knife
all right capn she said in a satisfied tone i guess we can run this blue country ourselves after this
then they rolled the frame underneath the great knife and handed the boolooroo the cord that released the blade
invisible trot followed soberly after them still wondering what she could do to save her friend
before any could stop him he butted his majesty so furiously that the king soared far into the air and tumbled in a heap among the benches where he lay moaning and groaning
go at once you dummies and find himor it will go hard with you
of course not said the boolooroo
he nodded cheerfully then and said
when this had been accomplished the boolooroo leaned over to try to discover why the frame rolled awayseemingly of its own accordand he was the more puzzled because it had never done such a thing before
in one placeat the head of the roomwas a raised platform for the royal family with elegant throne chairs for the king and queen and six smaller but richly upholstered chairs for the snubnosed princesses
control yourselves my dears replied the boolooroo the worst punishment i know how to inflict on anyone this prisoner is about to suffer
so ho roared the monarch you thought you could defy me earth clod did you
he jumped down from the platform and commanded the soldiers to raise the great knife into position
my guards are not to be trusted and i dont mean to let you out of my sight again until you are patched
as how he asked stepping from the frame
we will proceed with the ceremony of patching at once
ill have revengeillill
then they rolled the frame in position underneath the great knife and trot held in her hand the cord which would release it
after breakfast was over a procession was formed headed by the boolooroo and they marched the prisoner through the palace until they came to the room of the great knife
hi there he cried where are my soldiers
so the captain took a file of soldiers and went away very sorrowful for he did not know who would be the victim and if the boolooroo had no friends the captain had plenty and did not wish to see them patched
but you were mistaken
while trot was observing this dreadful machine the door opened and in walked the six snubnosed princesses all in a row and with their chins up as if they disdained everyone but themselves
first bind the earth man in the frame commanded the boolooroo well slice him in two before we do the same to the billygoat
why you said to fetch the first living creature we met and that was this billygoat replied the captain panting hard as he held fast to one of the goats horns
fine
but im the ruler here and ill do as i please
what do you mean prisoner by daring to lay hands upon me
this would indeed be a severe punishment therefore the princesses were pleased at the thought of capn bills becoming half a billygoat and the billygoats being half capn bill
no one can resist the mighty boolooroo of the blues so it is folly for you to rebel against my commands
trot was in the room too standing in a corner and listening to all that was said while she racked her little brain for an idea that would enable her to save capn bill from being patched
go and capture the first living creature you see and bring him here to be patched to capn bill
rich jewels of blue stones glittered upon their persons and the royal ladies were fully as gorgeous as they were haughty and overbearing
finding himself free he turned and assaulted the soldiers butting them so fiercely that they tumbled down in bunches and as soon as they could rise again ran frantically from the room and along the corridors as if a fiend was after them
but capn bill made no such attempt knowing it would be useless
the frightened soldiers hurried away to find tiggle and trot was well pleased because she knew tiggle was by this time safely hidden
then the door flew open and in came the soldiers dragging a great blue billygoat which was desperately striving to get free
the immense blade was so heavy that it took the strength of seven blueskins to raise it
these plumes waved gracefully in the air with every mincing step the princesses took
stop it
glorious cried the boolooroo wiping the tears of merriment from his eyes
capn bill rolled away in his frame and the knife fell harmlessly
when
hold him fast my men and as soon as ive had my coffee and oatmeal ill take him to the room of the great knife and patch him
then she seated herself in an out of the way place and quietly waited
huh exclaimed the boolooroo thats queer
the amazing conquest of the blues
no one could see her so no onenot even capn billknew she was there
as he stood bent nearly double his back was toward the billygoat which in their interest and excitement the soldiers were holding in a careless manner
now indeed the boolooroo was as angry as he was amazed
roll him up again soldiers
the boolooroo stared a moment and then he fell back in his throne laughing boisterously
the captain of the guards hesitated to obey this order
very well replied the boolooroo you shall eat with me for then i can keep an eye on you
but it were a pretty close call an i hope it wont happen again
the same thing happened as before
it is an insult to be spoken to by one about to be patched
the knife was built into a huge framework like a derrick that reached to the ceiling and it was so arranged that when the boolooroo pulled a cord the great blade would drop down in its frame and neatly cut in two the person who stood under it
the boolooroo stamped up and down the room muttering threats and declaring capn bill should be patched whether tiggle was found or not and while they waited trot took time to make an inspection of the place which she now saw for the first time in broad daylight
i cant think of anyone just now your spry and flighty high and mighty majesty he answered
immediately the boolooroo flew into another towering rage
meantime trot being invisible to all was roaming around the room and behind a bench she found a small coil of rope which she picked up
therefore her majesty paid no attention to anyone and no one paid any attention to her
the sailor followed and pulled out the boolooroo who when he saw the terrible goat was captured and tied fast quickly recovered his courage
while he put on his clothes the king occasionally gave the cord a sudden pull hoping to hurt capn bills big toe and make him yell but as no response came to this mean action the boolooroo finally looked into the room only to find he had been pulling on a leg of the couch and that his prisoner had escaped
then she stood back and watched the boolooroo and just as he pulled the cord she pulled on her rope and dragged the frame on its rollers away so that the great knife fell with a crash and sliced nothing but the air
now let us to business
now let the devils strike our scent said the scout tearing two rifles with all their attendant accouterments from beneath a bush and flourishing killdeer as he handed uncas his weapon two at least will find it to their deaths
but i thought i would make the offer seeing that youth commonly loves life
so uncas you had better take the lead while i will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speed
twas nothing but wonderment
but it was not the policy of hawkeye to affect the least concealment
chapter twenty six
the scout hesitated and appeared to muse
whither
can you lead me to him
hawkeye
hold said the scout grasping his friend by the shoulder let them yell again
uncas will stay was the calm reply
cut his bands said hawkeye to david who just then approached them
but the bear instead of obeying maintained the seat it had taken and growled
hold your head down and draw in your legs their formation might tell the truth too early
for what
if you stay it must be to sit down here in the shadow and take the part of uncas until such times as the cunning of the indians discover the cheat when as i have already said your times of trial will come
so choose for yourselfto make a rush or tarry here
still they betrayed no intention to depart
then as if satisfied of their safety the scout left his position and slowly entered the place it was silent and gloomy being tenanted solely by the captive and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purposed of cookery
the little knot of indians drew back in a body and suffered as they thought the conjurer and his inspired assistant to proceed
the scout who had left david at the door to ascertain they were not observed thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy
that providence is partial in its gifts for its own wise reasons the best and most contented of us must allow
it was easy to follow the tracks of the narragansetts but they seemed only to have wandered without guides or any other object than the pursuit of food
having reached within a few yards of the latter he arose to his feet silently and slowly
the impressions of footsteps were numerous but they all appeared like those of men who had wandered about the spot without any design to quit it
still no discovery was made at length uncas whose activity had enabled him to achieve his portion of the task the soonest raked the earth across the turbid little rill which ran from the spring and diverted its course into another channel so soon as its narrow bed below the dam was dry he stooped over it with keen and curious eyes
it was impossible to discover the expression of his features through the grotesque mask of paint under which they were concealed though duncan fancied it was rather melancholy than savage his head was shaved as usual with the exception of the crown from whose tuft three or four faded feathers from a hawks wing were loosely dangling
during one of these conferences heyward observed that uncas stood a patient and silent though as he imagined an interested listener
he appears to have no arms nor does he seem to be viciously inclined unless he communicate the alarm to his fellows who as you see are dodging about the water we have but little to fear from him
it was fortunate they did so
of that there is little cause of fear returned the scout slowly shaking his head this is a firm and straight though a light step and not over long
fire on no account
this is my schooling major and if one neglects the book there is little chance of learning from the open land of providence
repeating the words fellows who are dodging about the water he added so much for schooling and passing a boyhood in the settlements the knave has long legs though and shall not be trusted
here we have three pair of moccasins and two of little feet
recovering his recollection on the instant instead of sounding an alarm which might prove fatal to himself he remained stationary an attentive observer of the others motions
see said uncas pointing north and south at the evident marks of the broad trail on either side of him the dark hair has gone toward the forest
such cunning is not without its deviltry exclaimed hawkeye when he met the disappointed looks of his assistants
after proceeding a few miles the progress of hawkeye who led the advance became more deliberate and watchful
if anything should happen the call will be three croaks of a crow
the whole party now proceeded following the course of the rill keeping anxious eyes on the regular impressions
if i see you in danger may i not risk a shot
the eyes of the whole party followed the unexpected movement and read their success in the air of triumph that the youth assumed
from such undeniable testimony did the practised woodsman arrive at the truth with nearly as much certainty and precision as if he had been a witness of all those events which his ingenuity so easily elucidated cheered by these assurances and satisfied by a reasoning that was so obvious while it was so simple the party resumed its course after making a short halt to take a hurried repast
yet that is not the footstep of an indian the weight is too much on the heel and the toes are squared as though one of the french dancers had been in pigeon winging his tribe
a circle of a few hundred feet in circumference was drawn and each of the party took a segment for his portion
the dews were suffered to exhale and the sun had dispersed the mists and was shedding a strong and clear light in the forest when the travelers resumed their journey
you will find a beautiful print of it just opposite yon rock agin the hillside
it is true that the horses are here but the hurons are gone let us then hunt for the path by which they parted
i saw one of the birds fanning himself in the air just beyond the dead oakanother sign that we are approaching an encampment
then he reappeared creeping along the earth from which his dress was hardly distinguishable directly in the rear of his intended captive
a ragged calico mantle half encircled his body while his nether garment was composed of an ordinary shirt the sleeves of which were made to perform the office that is usually executed by a much more commodious arrangement
at last the scout spoke in english and at once explained the embarrassment of their situation
but while the earth was trodden and the footsteps of both men and beasts were so plainly visible around the place the trail appeared to have suddenly ended
by the lord it is no longer than a childs and yet the maidens are tall and comely
an instant of calm observation served to assure duncan that he was undiscovered
hawkeye and the mohicans now applied themselves to their task in good earnest
run back uncas and bring me the size of the singers foot
how now friend have you a mind to teach the beavers to sing
you see we have reached their settlement or encampment whispered the young man and here is one of the savages himself in a very embarrassing position for our further movements
instead of taking the alarm the unconscious savage stretched forward his neck as if he also watched the movements about the gloomy lake with a sort of silly curiosity
then lowering the dangerous muzzle he stretched forward his long neck as if to assist a scrutiny that was already intensely keen
if you find a man there he shall die a fleas death merry wives of windsor
do you keep him under your rifle while i creep in behind through the bush and take him alive
the scout turned to heyward and regarded him a moment with unconcealed amazement
he soon stopped again and waited for the whole party to come up
the spirits of the scout and the astonishing success of the chase in which a circuitous distance of more than forty miles had been passed did not fail to impart a portion of hope to the whole party
can you see where he has put his rifle or his bow
fire a whole platoon major
hound never ran on a more beautiful scent responded the scout dashing forward at once on the indicated route we are favored greatly favored and can follow with high noses
but cried duncan i see no signs of
the gentle ones interrupted the scout the varlet has found a way to carry them until he supposed he had thrown any followers off the scent my life on it we see their pretty little feet again before many rods go by
no no my knowledge for it neither of them was nigh fainting hereaway
he often stopped to examine the trees nor did he cross a rivulet without attentively considering the quantity the velocity and the color of its waters distrusting his own judgment his appeals to the opinion of chingachgook were frequent and earnest
see the heel has hardly touched the ground and there the dark hair has made a little jump from root to root
no no i have heard that the french indians had come into these hills to hunt the moose and we are getting within scent of their camp why should they not
hawkeye started and dropped his rifle when directed by the finger of his companion the stranger came under his view
in the meantime the uplifted hand of hawkeye was above him
softly softly we know our path but it is good to examine the formation of things
the fellow is stricken with a judgment and is mad
human natur is weak and it is possible we may not have taken the proper scent
i scent the hurons he said speaking to the mohicans yonder is open sky through the treetops and we are getting too nigh their encampment sagamore you will take the hillside to the right uncas will bend along the brook to the left while i will try the trail
in the next moment he was concealed by the leaves
the young mohican cast a glance at his father but maintaining his quiet and reserved mien he continued silent
shall we proceed demanded heyward
pass me the thong of buckskin uncas and let me take the length of this foot
tis the trail exclaimed the scout advancing to the spot the lad is quick of sight and keen of wit for his years
altogether the appearance of the individual was forlorn and miserable
before an hour had elapsed however the speed of hawkeye sensibly abated and his head instead of maintaining its former direct and forward look began to turn suspiciously from side to side as if he were conscious of approaching danger
pursuing the direction given by this discovery he entered the neighboring thicket and struck the trail as fresh and obvious as it had been before they reached the spring
the water soon flowed into its bed again but watching the ground on either side the foresters pursued their way content with knowing that the trail lay beneath
chapter twenty one
has uncas no counsel to offer in such a strait
chingachgook had caught the look and motioning with his hand he bade him speak
not a leaf was left unturned
the sticks were removed and the stones lifted for indian cunning was known frequently to adopt these objects as covers laboring with the utmost patience and industry to conceal each footstep as they proceeded
the consultation had the twofold merit of definiteness and brevity
german and english translations are available but the most acceptable english version besides laboring under the handicaps of an archaic style had to be condensed into half its volume in order to accomplish the streamlining of the book
at the end of his lectures in fifteen thirty one luther uttered a brief prayer and then dictated two scriptural texts which we shall inscribe at the end of these introductory remarks
it is my katherine much later when a friend of his was preparing an edition of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine
in his table talks the saying is recorded the epistle to the galatians is my epistle
i will on one condition
the work had to be condensed
theodore graebner
the preparation of this edition of luthers commentary on galatians was first suggested to me by mr p j zondervan of the firm of publishers in march nineteen thirty seven
the lord who has given us power to teach and to hear let him also give us the power to serve and to do
luther is still the greatest name in protestantism
luthers commentary fills seven hundred and thirty three octavo pages in the weidman edition of his works
my galatians for instance
the reformer had lectured on this epistle of saint pauls in fifteen nineteen and again in fifteen twenty three
it presents like no other of luthers writings the central thought of christianity the justification of the sinner for the sake of christs merits alone
it was written in latin
let us begin with that his commentary on galatians
we want you to help us publish some leading work of luthers for the general american market
and what book would be your choice
translated by theodore graebner
roerer took down luthers lectures and this manuscript has been preserved to the present day in a copy which contains also additions by veit dietrich and by cruciger friends of roerers who with him attended luthers lectures
we were resolved not to present this entire mass of exegesis
this is a librivox recording
the demonstration seemed to prove convincing for it was agreed that one may as well offer luther in the original german or latin as expect the american church member to read any translations that would adhere to luthers german or latin constructions and employ the mid victorian type of english characteristic of the translations now on the market
but the essence of luthers lectures is there
in other words these three men took down the lectures which luther addressed to his students in the course of galatians and roerer prepared the manuscript for the printer
and what is that
all librivox recordings are in the public domain
it would have run to more than fifteen hundred pages ordinary octavo like this since it is impossible to use the compressed structure of sentences which is characteristic of latin and particularly of luthers latin
the word of our god shall stand forever
by martin luther
the lectures which are preserved in the works herewith submitted to the american public were delivered in fifteen thirty one
preface
the condition is that i will be permitted to make luther talk american streamline him so to speakbecause you will never get people whether in or outside the lutheran church actually to read luther unless we make him talk as he would talk today to americans
will you do it
it was his favorite among all the biblical books
glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will to men
to it i am as it were in wedlock
my call is the highest possible for it is by jesus christ and god the father
verse one
against these boasting false apostles paul boldly defends his apostolic authority and ministry
paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead
paul takes pride in his ministry not to his own praise but to the praise of god
paul loses no time in defending himself against the charge that he had thrust himself into the ministry
the certainty of our calling
he reminds them of the time when he opposed peter to his face and reproved the chief of the apostles
in fact i am an apostle
paul came later and is beneath us
they said to the galatians you have no right to think highly of paul
if he says thou shalt be damned you tell him no for i fly to christ who gave himself for my sins
do you suppose that god for the sake of a few lutheran heretics would disown his entire church
this sort of thing brings the gospel into trouble
verse six
he puts on white to make himself look like an angel of light
verse one
it indicates his sorrow and his displeasure
he says to the galatians my call may seem inferior to you
we heard him preach
every minister should make much of his calling and impress upon others the fact that he has been delegated by god to preach the gospel
the most they could claim is that they were sent by others
he was the last to turn to christ
paul stands alone
unable to prevail by force he engages wicked and ungodly teachers who at first make common cause with us then claim that they are particularly called to teach the hidden mysteries of the scriptures to superimpose upon the first principles of christian doctrine that we teach
or do you suppose that god would have left his church floundering in error all these centuries the galatians were taken in by such arguments with the result that pauls authority and doctrine were drawn in question
today the anabaptists and others finding it difficult to condemn us accuse us lutherans of timidity in professing the whole truth
as a result we have this paradoxical situation the gospel supplies the world with the salvation of jesus christ peace of conscience and every blessing
paul devotes the first two chapters to a defense of his office and his gospel affirming that he received it not from men but from the lord jesus christ by special revelation and that if he or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel than the one he had preached he shall be accursed
the devil knows better than to appear ugly and black
as the ambassador of a government is honored for his office and not for his private person so the minister of christ should exalt his office in order to gain authority among men
these jewish christian fanatics who pushed themselves into the galatian churches after pauls departure boasted that they were the descendants of abraham true ministers of christ having been trained by the apostles themselves that they were able to perform miracles
paul an apostle not of men etc
paul exalts his ministry out of the desire to make known the name the grace and the mercy of god
from him that called you into the grace of christ
he has not seen christ nor has he had much contact with the other apostles indeed he persecuted the church of christ for a long time
verse six
saint paul wrote this epistle because after his departure from the galatian churches jewish christian fanatics moved in who perverted pauls gospel of mans free justification by faith in christ jesus
when men claiming such credentials come along they deceive not only the naive but also those who seemingly are well established in the faith this same argument is used by the papacy
unto another gospel
there may be something to that
just for that the world abhors the gospel
i am angry with you but his purpose was to call them back to the gospel
humble man that he was he will not now take a back seat
it must be watched
after rounding the peak she steered direct for the channel to which servadac by his gestures was pointing her and was not long in entering the creek
the count shook his head
captain servadac hastened towards him
i am quite aware of it
was he aware in short that the entire motions of the terrestrial sphere had undergone a complete modification to all these inquiries the count responded in the affirmative
i am not sure said he but what the tour of the mediterranean will prove to be the tour of the world
chapter nine
the lieutenant shook his head
chapter ten a search for algeria
count timascheff was himself no sailor but had the greatest confidence in leaving the command of his yacht in the hands of lieutenant procope a man of about thirty years of age and an excellent seaman
the lieutenant paused to allow time for reflection and added moreover i have every reason to believe that we are not so near the sun as we have been
nothing was to be done but to put about and return in disappointment towards the north
but algiers like all the other coast towns had apparently been absorbed into the bowels of the earth
i confess i am puzzled
there is no fear of that sir
captain servadac with clenched teeth and knitted brow stood sternly almost fiercely regarding the boundless waste of water
no doubt about that said servadac and i suppose that having crossed the orbit of venus we have a good chance of running into the orbit of mercury
after pondering awhile he said if we were farther away i should expect to find a depth of two or three hundred fathoms instead of five fathoms
the lieutenant was well informed in many matters outside the pale of his profession and his attainments were alike creditable to himself and to the liberal friend who had given him his education
perhaps the depths might disclose what the surface failed to reveal and count timascheff anxious that servadac should have every facility afforded him for solving his doubts called for the sounding line
on the first morning of the cruise lieutenant procope who like most russians spoke french fluently was explaining these peculiarities to captain servadac the count was present and the conversation perpetually recurred as naturally it would to the phenomena which remained so inexplicable to them all
i can give you a proof which i think you will own is conclusive
the late astounding events however had rendered procope manifestly uneasy and not the less so from his consciousness that the count secretly partook of his own anxiety
with a favorable wind she would certainly have made eleven knots an hour had not the high waves somewhat impeded her progress
happily the recent phenomena had no effect upon the compass the magnetic needle which in these regions had pointed about twenty two degrees from the north pole had never deviated in the leasta proof that although east and west had apparently changed places north and south continued to retain their normal position as cardinal points
the imperial fort too was built upon an elevation of seven hundred fifty feet it is incredible that it should be so totally submerged unless some vestiges of these are found i shall begin to suspect that the whole of africa has been swallowed in some vast abyss
five fathoms
and finish up by a collision with the sun added the count
it is very evident said the lieutenant that ever since the first of january the earth has been moving in a new orbit and from some unknown cause has drawn nearer to the sun
all the images of his past life floated upon his memory his thoughts sped away to his native france only to return again to wonder whether the depths of ocean would reveal any traces of the algerian metropolis
surely some portion of the casbah must still rise above the waves
would not the loftiest eminences of the city at least be visible
nor did these waves in the usual way partially unfurl themselves and rebound against the sides of the vessel they might rather be described as long undulations carrying the schooner its weight diminished from the same cause as that of the water alternately to such heights and depths that if captain servadac had been subject to seasickness he must have found himself in sorry plight
the ship could not have been in better hands
and what demonstration do you offer asked servadac eagerly that it will not happen
not a material object of any kind was to be noticed floating on the surface of the water not one branch of a tree had been seen drifting by nor one spar belonging to one of the numerous vessels that a month previously had been moored in the magnificent bay which stretched twelve miles across from cape matafuz to point pexade
i can sir
her sea going qualities were excellent and would have amply sufficed for a circumnavigation of the globe
although only a moderate breeze was blowing the sea was rough a circumstance to be accounted for only by the diminution in the force of the earths attraction rendering the liquid particles so buoyant that by the mere effect of oscillation they were carried to a height that was quite unprecedented
for a few miles she followed the line hitherto presumably occupied by the coast of algeria but no land appeared to the south
you must see lieutenant i should think that we are not so near the coast of algeria as you imagined
another circumstance was most remarkable
is it not impossible he murmured aloud that any city should disappear so completely
after an apprenticeship on a merchant ship he had entered the imperial navy and had already reached the rank of lieutenant when the count appointed him to the charge of his own private yacht in which he was accustomed to spend by far the greater part of his time throughout the winter generally cruising in the mediterranean whilst in the summer he visited more northern waters
can you satisfy us of that asked the count
both the count and the captain expressed themselves reassured by his representations and observed that they must now do all in their power to discover what had become of the vast continent of africa of which they were hitherto failing so completely to find a vestige
simply this captain that since the earth entered her new orbit half the sixty four days has already elapsed and yet it is only just recently that she has crossed the orbit of venus hardly one third of the distance to be traversed to reach the sun
at the same time we have the problem still unsolved that the mediterranean has evidently been transported to the equatorial zone
for the next thirty six hours until the fourth of february the sea was examined and explored with the most unflagging perseverance
his pulse beat fast as he recalled the friends and comrades with whom he had spent the last few years in that vanished city
steam up and canvas spread the schooner started eastwards
the earth has undoubtedly entered upon a new orbit but she is not incurring any probable risk of being precipitated onto the sun
its depth remained invariable still four or at most five fathoms and although its bottom was assiduously dredged it was only to prove it barren of marine production of any type
thirsting for glory rather than for gold slightly scatter brained but warm hearted generous and brave he was eminently formed to be the protege of the god of battles
and through a storm of shot not one of which touched the prostrate officer the troop passed in safety
chapter two
side by side they fought in two campaigns
when a private in the eighth cavalry he had been on the point of quitting the army at twenty eight years of age but unexpectedly he had been appointed orderly to captain servadac
she was a colonels widow young and handsome very reserved not to say haughty in her manner and either indifferent or impervious to the admiration which she inspired captain servadac had not yet ventured to declare his attachment of rivals he was well aware he had not a few and amongst these not the least formidable was the russian count timascheff
ben zoof was devoted body and soul to his superior officer
ben zoof however did not despair of ultimately converting the captain and meanwhile had resolved never to leave him
hector servadac was thirty years of age an orphan without lineage and almost without means
they came to a place where the side work of the trench had been so riddled by shell that a portion of it had actually fallen in leaving an aperture quite unsheltered from the grape shot that was pouring in thick and fast
the bond of union thus effected could never be severed and although ben zoofs achievements had fairly earned him the right of retirement he firmly declined all honors or any pension that might part him from his superior officer
the men hesitated
servadac had saved ben zoofs life in japan ben zoof had rendered his master a like service in the soudan
to crown all montmartre boasted a mountaina veritable mountain envious tongues indeed might pronounce it little more than a hill but ben zoof would have allowed himself to be hewn in pieces rather than admit that it was anything less than fifteen thousand feet in height
ben zoofs eyes glistened with delight and from that moment hector servadac and montmartre held equal places in his affection
in an instant servadac mounted the side work laid himself down in the gap and thus filling up the breach by his own body shouted march on
mother carey played the dear old common metre tune and the voices rang out in whittiers hymn
the housewarming was at its height and everybody agreed once in every ten minutes that it was probably the most beautiful party that had ever happened in the history of the world
underneath it we lay a posy of pressed daisies buttercups and queen annes lace the wild flowers she loved best
we shut our eyes the flowers bloom on we murmur but the corn ears fill we choose the shadow but the sun that casts it shines behind us still
gilbert at the head of the procession held mother hamiltons picture which had been taken from the old brick oven where my son tom had hidden it
peter crouched on the hearth and lighted the fire in three places then handed the torch to kathleen as he crept again into his mothers lap awed into complete silence by the influence of his own mystic rite kathleen waved the torch to and fro as she recited some beautiful lines written for some such purpose as that which called them together to night
approaching the dining table he carefully placed the article in the centre and removed the cloth
natty harmon tried the kitchen pump secretly several times during the evening for the water had to run up hill all the way from the well to the kitchen sink and he believed this to be a continual miracle that might give out at any moment
mother careys bedroom with its bouquets of field flowers on the wall paper was gaily lighted and ready to receive the gift
we cannot be happy without mr popham
thank you mr popham said mrs carey her eyes twinkling as she looked at the laughing children
to night there was no need of extra heat and there were great ceremonies to be observed in lighting the fires on the hearthstones
mother carey poured coffee nancy chocolate and the others helped serve the sandwiches and cake doughnuts and tarts
it was as cheery gay festive neighborly and friendly a supper as ever took place in the dining room of the yellow house although governor weatherby may have had some handsomer banquets in his time when it was over all made their way into the rosy bowery summer parlor
the carey housewarming
grant that trust and peace and comfort may abide within and that love and light and usefulness may go out from this house forever
he always slipped up his glasses during this performance and closed his eyes but neither grey hairs nor specs could dim the radiant smile that made him seem about fifteen years old and the junior of both his children
the careys all sang like thrushes and even peter holding his hymn book upside down put in little bird notes always on the key whenever he caught a familiar strain
the guests naturally had no associations with the carey curse and the careys themselves were dumb with amazement and despair
last of all the entire company gathered round the oldfashioned piano for a parting hymn
water flowed freely through cousin anns expensive pipes that had been buried so deep in their trenches that the winter frosts could not affect them
dont know most everything she says sounds like the bible or shakespeare to me
the tall silver candle sticks gleamed in the firelight the silver dish of polished baldwins blushed rosier in the glow
they began with the one in the family sitting room colonel wheeler ralph thurston mr and mrs bill harmon with natty and rufus mr and mrs popham with digby and lallie joy all standing in admiring groups and thrilling with delight at the order of events
mother carey spoke these words so simply and naturally as she looked towards her neighbors one after another with her hand resting on peters curly head that they hardly knew whether to keep quiet or say amen
it was the dirty boy carefully mended
the face of the mahogany shone with delight and why not when it was doing everything almost everything within the scope of a piano and yet the family had enjoyed weeks of good nourishing meals on what had been saved by its exertions
once more the liberal year laughs out oer richer stores than gems or gold once more with harvest song and shout is natures bloodless triumph told
thou who settest the solitary in families bless the life that is sheltered here
was that the bible osh whispered bill harmon
olive had painted the motto on a long narrow panel of canvas and giving it to mr popham stood by the fireside while he deftly fitted it into the place prepared for it the family had feared that he would tell a good story when he found himself the centre of attraction but he was as dumb as peter and for the same reason
next came olives turn to help in the ceremonies
the stove in the cellar always alluded to by gilbert as the young furnace had not yet been used save by way of experiment but it was believed to be a perfect success
ive seen this thing layin in the barn chamber in a thousand pieces all summer explained mr popham radiantly
soon another fire sparkled and snapped on the hearth and there were songs and poems and choruses and osh pophams fiddle to say nothing of the supreme event of the evening his rendition of fly like a youthful hart or roe over the hills where spices grow to mother careys accompaniment
in it are herbs of the field for health of the body a fern leaf for grace a sprig of elm for peace one of oak for strength with evergreen to show that we live forever in the deeds we have done
it was kind of you to spend so much time in our behalf
then nancy handed peter a loosely bound sheaf saying to light this fire i give you a torch
aint they the greatest murmured lallie joy turning to her father but he had disappeared from the group
eighteen
there never was anybody needed you so much as she doesnever
he neglected his wife and froze her blood and frightened her to death poor little shadder
but nancy carey never shy and as eager to give herself as people always are who are born and bred in joy and love nancy hopped out of mother careys warm nest one day and fixing her bright eyes and sunny hopeful glance on the lonely frowning little neighbor stretched out her hand in friendship
whatever appealed to her sense of beauty was straightway transferred to paper or canvas
blamed if i know
done
henry lord with the degree of p h d to his credit had been professor of zoology at a new england college but had resigned his post in order to write a series of scientific text books
always irritable cold indifferent he had grown rapidly more so as years went on
they have no bodies
doctor of what asked mrs carey
oh mother theres always so much spare room in your heartfor you took in julia and yet we never felt the differencewont you make a place for olive
why dont you do flowers and houses olive inquired cyril solicitously
shes wonderful
a few moments later nancy entered her mothers room her arms filled with treasures from the woods and fields
mr popham exaggerated nothing but on the contrary left much unsaid in his narrative of the family at the house of lords
it proved to be a long and intimate talk and when mrs carey looked out of her bedroom window just before supper she saw at the pasture bars the two girls with their arms round each other and their cheeks close together
i suppose theyre easier olive returned with a sigh but who could bear to do them when there are living breathing moving things things that puzzle you by looking different every minute
and people paint fruit and dead fish on platters and pitchers of lemonade with ice inwhy dont you try things like those
is the mother dead mrs carey asked
she makes effort after effort trembling with eagerness and when she fails to reproduce what she sees she works herself into a frenzy of grief and disappointment
then the poor little shadow of a woman dropped wearily into her grave and a certain elderly mrs bangs with grey hair and firm chin came to keep house and do the work
i wouldnt trust him to doctor a sick cat
what has he done to make him so unpopular queried mrs carey
a grove of poplars to the left of it only made the prospect more depressing and if it had not been for a great sheet of water near by floating with cow lilies and pond lilies the whole aspect of the place would have been unspeakably dreary
its an awful queer world
not that i could make a better one
shes older than i am but so tiny and sad and shy that she seems like a child
youd better give her lessons in self control mr lord answered they are cheaper than instruction in drawing and much more practical
she worked discovering laws and making rules for herself since she had no helpers when she could not make a rabbit or a bird look real on paper she searched in her fathers books for pictures of its bones
her only interests in life were her younger brother cyril delicate and timid and in continual terror of his fatherand a passion for drawing and sketching that was fairly devouring in its intensity
people dont have to be doctors of medicine interrupted gilbert grandfather was alexander carey l lddoctor of laws that is
if you dont work hard you cant keep up with the times
the carey children had only found it by accident
he keeps the thou shalt not commandments first rate hen lord does
her hand so marvellously full of skill had never held anothers and she was desperately self conscious but magnetism flowed from nancy as electric currents from a battery
mr popham laid down his brush
you wont never see nothin of em said mr popham
her gloomy young heart was visited by frequent storms and she looked as unlovable as she was unloved
one afternoon nancy and kathleen had walked up the road in search of pastures new and had spied down in a distant hollow a gloomy grey house almost surrounded by cedars
a lonelier creature than olive lord at sixteen could hardly be imagined she was a tiny thing for her years with a little white oval face and peaked chin pronounced eyebrows beautifully arched and a mass of tangled untidy dark hair
o cyril there must be some better way of doing i just draw the outline of an animal and then i put hairs or feathers on it
then for the three years before her mothers death there had been surreptitious lessons from a portland teacher paid for out of mr lords house allowance for one of his chief faults was an incredible parsimony amounting almost to miserliness
the first interview purely a casual one took place on the edge of the lily pond where olive was sketching frogs and where nancy went for cat onine tails
they couldnt run nor move theyre just pasteboard
she is wild to know how to do things
nancys curly chestnut crop shone in the sun and olives thick black plaits looked blacker by contrast
have you ever lifted a stone and seen the pale yellow stunted shoots of grass under it
sandford shook his head
what can you mean by that miss woodley
but for what my passions now dictate continued he i will not answer
the rapid emotion of varying passions which immediately darted over his features informed miss woodley that her secret was discoveredshe hid her face while the tears that fell down to her bosom confirmed the truth of his suggestion beyond what oaths could have done
lord elmwood laid down the newspaper to attend to her
miss woodley was going to say something farther but as if incapable of attending to her he hastened out of the room
my lord miss milners taste is not a depraved one it is but too refined
i will make no unjust use of what i know he replied with firmness
yet i cannot but lament that i am not as well informed as you are
miss milners health is not good said mrs horton a few minutes after
lord elmwood was sensible of the embarrassment his presence gave miss woodley and understood the reproaches which she seemed to vent upon herself in silence
you talk mysteriously
for gods sake take care what you are doingyou are destroying my prospects of futurityyou are making this world too dear to me
but she would account it an injury
so there is to me added sandford with a sarcastic sneer
great as my friendship is there are certainly bounds to itbounds that shall save her in spite of herselfand he raised his voice
i am glad to hear it he returned quickly for although i am not of a suspicious nature yet in regard to her affections for him i cannot but still have my doubts
i am not only proper from character but from circumstances to be relied uponmy interest is so nearly connected with the interest and my happiness with the happiness of my ward that those principles as well as my honour would protect her against every peril arising from my being trusted
is she not afraid that i will thwart her inclinations
to relieve her from both he laid his hand with force upon his heart and said do you believe me
miss woodley was too little versed in the subject to know this would have been not to love at all at least not to the extent of breaking through engagements and all the various obstacles that still militated against their union
they are confusedthey are triumphant at present
again he searched his own thoughts nor ineffectually as before
perhaps i am mistaken answered she
i have never yet however been vanquished by them and even upon this occasion my reason shall combat them to the lastand my reason shall fail me before i do wrong
then must the person be unworthy of her
i think miss woodley miss milner was extremely to blame though i did not chuse to tell her so before mr sandford in giving lord frederick an opportunity of speaking to her unless she means that he shall renew his addresses
why so said he warmly
he was going to leave the roomshe followed him and cried but my lord how shall i see again the unhappy object of my treachery
we are not judges of what belongs to ourselves he repliedi am transported at the tidings you have revealed and yet perhaps i had better never have heard them
i wish to prove my friendship to miss milner but she will not suffer meand every step that i take for her happiness i take in the most perplexing uncertainty
thank you from my heart for your love you will never know perhaps how much it is to me
and she threw her arms round her cousins neck and brave rachel at last burst into tears
better to day tamar enquired this grand and beautiful young lady
you resemble me rachel you are fearless and inflexible and generous
yes said rachel
of mark wylder i say this his name has been for years hateful to me and recently it has become frightful and you will promise me simply this that you will never ask me to speak again about him
she seized it she clung to it
rachel dear im so glad to see you said dorcas placing her arms gently about her neck and kissing her twice or thrice
dorcas returned her gaze with one of haughty amazement and rachel said
it was not very much past eleven that morning when the pony carriage from brandon drew up before the little garden wicket of redmans farm
rachels pale and sharpened features and dilated eye struck her with a painful surprise
i like to call you cousinkindred is so pleasant
oh dorcas darling dont forsake me i am very lonely here and my spirits are gone and i never needed kindness so much before
i like you still rachel im sure ill always like you
we will make a little tour together when all this shall have blown over in a few weeks and choose our retreat and with the winters snow well vanish from brandon and appear with the early flowers at our cottage among the beautiful woods and hills of wales
you have been more ill than i thought darling and you are still far from quite recovered
she spoke with a sudden energy which partook of fear and passion and flushed her thin cheek and made her languid eyes flash
i made you a voluntary promise dorcas and now you will make me one
thank you rachel my cousin rachel my only friend
will you come rachel
you have heard of course of mr wylders absence
you have been so ill my poor rachel
im only disappointed rachel i thought you would have trusted me as i did you
can i conjecture why he is gone murmured rachel still gazing with a wild kind of apathy into distance
i dont understand his absence
there was something of sweetness and fondness in her tones and manner which was new to rachel and comforting and she returned the greeting as kindly and felt more like her former self
thank you dorcas dear
i dont think rachel dear you heard me said dorcas
the young queen looked on her kindly but sadly through her large strange eyes clouded with a presage of futurity and she kissed her again and said
be he near or be he far i regard his very name with horror
poor rachel her nature recoiled from deceit and she told at all events as much of the truth as she dared
dorcas you are changed have i lost your love for asking so poor a kindness
i was wounded to find you had thoughts you would not trust to me but i have made the promise and ill keep it and i love you all the same
but poor rachel lake had more than that stoical hypocrisy which enables the tortured spirits of her sex to lift a pale face through the flames and smile
if he does not return in a day or two chelford i am sure will speak to me and then i shall tell him my resolution
i ought not to have doubted you and she kissed her again
dorcas in her strange way was moved
remember i am neither well nor happy and forgive what you cannot like in me
rachel dear i have a plan for you and me we shall be old maids you and i and live together like the ladies of llangollen careless and happy recluses
so there came a step and a little rustling of feminine draperies the small door opened and rachel entered with her hand extended and a pale smile of welcome
she was up and dressed and this moment coming down and would be very happy to see miss brandon if she would step into the drawing room
she was sanguine she was genial and companionable and her spirits rose at the sight of a friendly face
i shall soon be as well as i am ever likely to bethat is quite well answered rachel
chapter twenty four
at sight of this castle or cottage in the air rachel lighted up
dorcass large eyes rested upon her with a grave enquiry and then miss brandon looked down in silence for a while on the carpet and was thinking a little sternly maybe and with a look of pain still holding rachels hand she said with a sad sort of reproach in her tone
yes rachel i do love you
dorcas brandon pays rachel a visit
they sat down side by side and dorcas held her hand
i have very few to love me now and i thought you might love me as i have begun to love you
it was escapeflight from gylingdenflight from brandonflight from redmans farm they and all their hated associations would be far behind and that awful page in her story not torn out indeed but gummed down as it were and no longer glaring and glowering in her eyes every moment of her waking life
ill let brandon and abdicate
chelford had a note from mr wylder this morninganother notehis coming delayed and something of his having to see some person who is abroad continued dorcas after a little pause
i meant to speak to him and end all between us and i would now write but there is no address to his letters
yes we sometimes conjecture right and sometimes wrong there are many things best not conjectured about at allsome interesting some abominable some that pass all comprehension i never mean to conjecture if i can help it again
it was a hope
rachel dear you have not told my secret
maybe rachel dear you would like to drive a little
the sun glimmered through the boughs behind her her face was in shade and its delicate chiselling was brought out in soft reflected lights and old tamar looked on her in a sort of wonder her beauty seemed so celestial and splendid
no darling not yet it is very good of you
that spirit belongs to the blood of our strange race all our women were so
no indeed dorcasnever and never will and i think though i have learned to fear death i would rather die than let stanley even suspect it
and the wan oracle having spoken she sate down in the same sort of abstraction again beside dorcas and she looked full in her cousins eyes
i think lady chelford and her son begin to think there is more in this oddly timed journey of mr wylders than first appeared when i came into the parlour this morning i knew they were speaking of it
miss brandon took old tamars hand gently and pressed it
you have been very kind
i suppose she was glad and took this way of showing it and tall beautiful graceful in rustling silks she glided into the tiny drawing room silently and sate down softly by the window looking out upon the flowers and the falling leaves mottled in light and shadow
ive heard of your coming here and sending so often
it is an antipathyan antipathy i cannot get over dear dorcas you may think it a madness but dont blame me
and wylder laughed again and began to whistle very lownot i fancy for want of thought but as a sort of accompaniment thereto for he suddenly said
and wylder laughed too more suddenly and noisily than the humour of the joke seemed quite to call for and glanced a grim look from the corners of his eyes on lake but the gallant captain did not seem to perceive it and after a few seconds more he handed it very innocently back to mrs dorothy only remarking
i dont know anything about him almost but i hate him
i was always afraid of him in a long peruke and dark red velvet coat facing the hall door
i dont know but i think he mentioned larkinss house didnt he
i dont think hes much of a sportsman
mine indeed laughed poor little mrs dorothy well dear me no indeedand in an earnest whisper close in his eara present to miss brandon and the donor is not a hundred miles away from your elbow my lord and she winked slyly and laughed with a little nod at wylder
it was not proved only thought likely which showed what a nice character he was but he might have done worse
hes not a man for country quarters
look at it do mr wylderisnt it like the ace of hearts
have you seen it captain lake and he placed it in that gentlemans fingers who now took his turn at the lamp and contemplated the little parallelogram with a gleam of sly amusement
the ace of hearts
hell soon be back in town or to brighton i said
and wylder chuckled angrily and the small change in his pocket tinkled fiercely as his eye glanced on the graceful captain who was entertaining the ladies no doubt very agreeably in the distance
what the d has he come down here for
whatever lord chelford said miss brandon received it very graciously and even with a momentary smile
hes a very gentlemanlike fellow and your cousin
that
oh
im bad at genealogies
i seeto be surereally wylder it does your taste infinite credit
the captain appeared quite easy and cheerful but mark i thought notwithstanding his laughter and general jollity was uncomfortable and i saw him once or twice when stanleys eye was not upon him glance sharply on the young man with an uneasy and not very friendly curiosity
i thought of the fair brunnisende with the captive knight in the hands of her seneschal before her and i fancied he said something of having found him trespassing in her town and brought him up for judgment
im glad you like it says wylder chuckling benignantly on it over his shoulder
when lord chelford joined us i perceived that wylder was in the room and saw a very cordial greeting between him and lake
you know captain lake said lord chelford addressing me
he was going to marry the gamekeepers daughter it was thought and he and the old boy who was for high blood and all that were at loggerheads about it
and where is he staying
it cant be for money or balls or play and he has no honest business anywhere
my mother could tell us all about itwe brandons lakes wylders and chelfords
i took a dislike to him at first sight long ago and that never happened me but i was right
why should you though
i often thought since that he had expected to see wylder before him
so chelford led stanley lake before the lady of the castle
by the bye wylder you know the pictures here who is the tall man with the long pale face and wild phosphoric eyes
i forget all the other good things he did but he ended by shooting himself through the head in his bed room and that was not the worst thing ever he did
its well to be distinguished in any line
she arrested the file of gentlemen just by a large lamp before whose effulgence she presented the subject of her eulogyone of those costly trifles which announce the approach of hymen as flowers spring up before the rosy steps of may
im not quite sure
what are you laughing at asked wylder a little snappishly
it is such a darling little thing andlook nowis not it magnificent
never mind wylder its the winning card said lord chelford laying his hand on his shoulder
fie lake theres no poetry in you said lord chelford laughing
oh i knowthats lorne brandon
i believe charlie he recommenced suddenly there is not such an unnatural family on record as ours is there
well it was prettyfrench i dare saya little set of tabletsa toythe cover of enamel studded in small jewels with a slender border of symbolic flowers and with a heart in the centre a mosaic of little carbuncles rubies and other red and crimson stones placed with a view to light and shade
do you know
her conversation was lively and rather bold not at all in the coarse sense but she struck me as having formed a system of ethics and views of life both good humoured and sarcastic and had carried into her rustic sequestration the melancholy and precocious lore of her early london experience
at dinner lake was easy and amusing
at this moment miss brandon entered with her brilliant cousin rachel the blonde and the dark it was a dazzling contrast
it seemed to me to indicate a great deal more than mere indifferencesomething of aversion and nearer to a positive emotion than anything i had yet seen in that exquisitely apathetic face
and lake turned round upon me a little abruptly his odd yellowish eyes a little like those of the sea eagle and the ghost of his smile that flickered on his singularly pale face with a stern and insidious look confronted me
i dont know whos my cousin or who isnt nor you dont whove been for ten years over those dd papers but i think hes the nastiest dog i ever met
yes
i glanced round for wylder but he was not there
wylder looked confoundedly angry and flustered standing with his heels on the edge of the rug his hands in his pockets jingling some silver there and glancing from under his red forehead sternly and unsteadily across the room
wylder was laughing rather redly with the upper part of his face very surly i thought
the church yard meteor expired there was nothing in a moment but his ordinary smile of recognition
is this yours mrs wylder
now heres a thing worth your looking at
there was something evil and shrinking in his aspect which i felt with a sort of chill like the commencing fascination of a serpent
that meal passed off rather pleasantly and when we joined the ladies in the drawing room the good vicars enthusiastic little wife came to meet us in one of her honest little raptures
thats all
i wonder she did not smile oftener it became her so but her greeting to captain lake was more than usually haughty and frozen and her features i fancied particularly proud and pale
i suppose miss partridge would have had a precious lot of babbies and who knows where the estate would have been by this time
whereupon lake laughed quietly still looking on the ace of hearts with his sly eyes
shake hands with your cousin my dear said old lady chelford peremptorily
just to get him off this unpleasant groove with a little jolt i said
i really cant tell but hell soon tire of country life
lake
a devil in a family now and then is not such a bad thing when theres work for him all the time he was talking to me his angry little eyes were following lake they say he killed his son a blackguard who was found shot with his face in the tarn in the park
wholake
old women always like rascals
i was vexed with myself for having managed with so little skill a conversation which opened so oddly and frankly might have placed me on relations so nearly confidential with that singular and beautiful girl i ought to have rejoicedbut we dont always see what most concerns our peace
its curtains were of thick and faded tapestry
she provokes me
did you see that said wylder in my ear with a chuckle and wagging his head he added rather loftily for him miss brandon i reckon has taken your measure master stanley as well as i i wonder what the deuce the old dowager sees in him
really radie youre enough to frighten a poor fellow you wont mind a word i say and go on predicting all manner of mischief between me and wylder the very nature of which i cant surmise
very wiseexactly
whywhat has sir harry done
the fact is captain lake an accomplished player made a pretty little revenue of sir harrys billiards which were wild and noisy and liking his money thought he liked himselfa confusion not uncommon
miss rachel only glanced across her mufflers on his face
i suppose the balance of attraction and repulsion was overcome by miss lake much as he disliked stanley for wylder followed them out with lord chelford to help the young lady into her cloak and goloshes and i found myself near miss brandon for the first time that evening and much to my surprise she was first to speak and that rather strangely
i was always a lover of such antiquities but i confess at that moment i would have vastly preferred a sprightly modern chintz and a trumpery little french bed in a corner of the brandon arms
now thats impossible radie for i really dont think i once thought of him all this eveningexcept just while we were talking
but dont these very wise things sometimes turn out very foolishly
there can hardly be a second opinion miss brandon i think it a very wise measure i replied much surprised
you seem to be very sensible mr de cresseron pray tell me frankly what do you think of all this
their walk continued silent for the greater part neither was quite satisfied with the other
to my mind there has always been something inexpressibly awful in family feuds
there was a bright moonlight broken by the shadows of overhanging boughs and withered leaves and the mottled lights and shadows glided oddly across his pale features
when i heard the servants step traversing that long gallery as it seemed to the in haste to be gone and when all grew quite silent i began to feel a dismal sort of sensation and lighted the pair of wax candles which i found upon the small writing table
and he added something still less complimentary
my cigar case was a resource
miss lake declined the carriage to night
all the furniture belonged to other times
mark my words youll find him too strong for you aye and too deep
what i say is altogether on your own account
if a fellows been a little bit wild hes beelzebub at once bractons a very good fellow i can assure you
i peeped through the dense window curtain there were no shutters
would you dislike my smoking a cigar radie
she was so unreserved it seemed and yet in this directness there was something almost contemptuous
it is very happy for her at least they are not said rachel and a long silence ensued
they had not walked far when lake suddenly said
i dont think they pretend to like one another
its four posts were like the rest of it oak well nigh black fantastically turned and carved with a great urn like capital and base and shaped midway like a gigantic lance handle
i did not even take the precaution of smoking up the chimney
i was not a bit afraid of being found out
but i thought she liked sir harry bracton hes a good looking fellow and queens bracton is a very nice thing you know
a little bit of plaster tumbled down the chimney and startled me confoundedly
it was one of many opening upon the long gallery which had been the scene four generations back of that unnatural and bloody midnight duel which had laid one scion of this ancient house in his shroud and driven another a fugitive to the moral solitudes of a continental banishment
you have given him time enough
i really dont think wylder cares twopence about her or she about him and stanley lake laughed gently and sleepily
i boldly lighted my cheroot
really radie youre quite mistaken
you were always the same close dark and crooked and wise in your own conceit
in the meantime miss lake with her hand on her brothers arm was walking swiftly under the trees of the back avenue towards that footpath which through wild copse and broken clumps near the park emerges upon the still darker road which passes along the wooded glen by the mills and skirts the little paling of the recluse ladys garden
yes so they said but that would i think have been worse
i take that for granted in the nature of things it can hardly be otherwise i replied a good deal startled and perplexed by the curious audacity of her interrogatory
by this time lord chelford and wylder returned and disgusted rather with myself i ruminated on my want of general ship
the portion of it which the carpet did not cover showed it to be oak dark and rugged
it is quite understood it was all you know old lady chelfords arrangement and dorcas is so supine i believe she would allow herself to be given away by anyone and to anyone rather than be at the least trouble
the chapel lay full in view where so many of the strange and equivocal race under whose ancient roof tree i then stood were lying under their tombstones
i radie he answered quietly why on earth should you think so
chapter eleven
something may be made of mark wylder
whatever you meditate he probably anticipates ityou know bestand you will find him prepared
but rachel at last said
somehow i had grown nervous
i assure you upon my honour ive no secret
the sombre old trees like gigantic hearse plumes black and awful
do you really think your friend mr wylder cares about me
to burn without ceasing to flytherein lies the marvel of genius
to teach reading means to light the fire every syllable spelled out sparkles
thoughtful minds make but little use of the phrase the fortunate and the unfortunate
why argot is horrible
who denies that
and so it goes on
man is not a circle with a single centre he is an ellipse with a double focus
even dialect let that pass
in this guise it becomes horrible
it is the language of prisons galleys convicts of everything that is most abominable in society etc etc
how argot
since when has malady banished medicine
who are we ourselves
nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in its nudity in the broad light of thought of the horrible swarming of slang
this service plautus rendered consciously or unconsciously by making two carthaginian soldiers talk phoenician that service moliere rendered by making so many of his characters talk levantine and all sorts of dialects
are you what is called a happy man
there is hardly one day out of a hundred which is wholly joyous and sunny
it is so made that everywhere we feel the sense of punishment
it gnashes and whispers completing the gloom with mystery
to keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion to hold above the gulf were it but a fragment of some language which man has spoken and which would otherwise be lost that is to say one of the elements good or bad of which civilization is composed or by which it is complicated to extend the records of social observation is to serve civilization itself
however he who says light does not necessarily say joy
where are we at this moment
what is slang
we have never understood this sort of objections
is it really the french tongue the great human tongue
phoenician very good levantine quite right
one finds it difficult to recognize
each day has its own great grief or its little care
it is slang the words are misshapen and stamped with an indescribable and fantastic bestiality
the earth is not devoid of resemblance to a jail
assuredly if the tongue which a nation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest the language which has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention and study
a certain school of criticism twenty years ago which used to say half of the works of shakespeare consists of plays upon words and punstalked slang

they informed the english parliament of this unexpected incident and assured them that they had entered into no private treaty with the king
they required him to issue orders to oxford and to all his other garrisons commanding their surrender to the parliament and the king sensible that their resistance was to very little purpose willingly complied
the scottish generals and commissioners affected great surprise on the appearance of the king and though they paid him all the exterior respect due to his dignity they instantly set a guard upon him under color of protection and made him in reality a prisoner
they were such as a captive entirely at mercy could expect from the most inexorable victor
during the time that the king remained in the scottish army at newcastle died the earl of essex the discarded but still powerful and popular general of the parliament
he rode before a portmanteau and called himself ashburnhams servant
yet were they little worse than what were insisted on before the battle of naseby
his death in this conjuncture was a public misfortune
he requested a personal treaty with the parliament
the infamy of this bargain had such an influence on the scottish parliament that they once voted that the king should be protected and his liberty insisted on
the scottish generals would enter into no confidence with him and still treated him with distant ceremony and feigned respect
the parliament and the scots laid their proposals before the king
the parliament though earnestly applied to by the king refused to allow his chaplains to attend him because they had not taken the covenant
and though the contributions which they had levied as well as the price of their living at free quarters must be deducted yet still the sum which they insisted on was very considerable
on his journey the whole country flocked to behold him moved partly by curiosity partly by compassion and affection
he defended raglan castle to extremity and opened not its gates till the middle of august
the english commissioners who some days after came to take him under their custody were admitted to kiss his hands and he received them with the same grace and cheerfulness as if they had travelled on no other errand than to pay court to him
fully sensible of the excesses to which affairs had been carried and of the worse consequences which were still to be apprehended he had resolved to conciliate a peace and to remedy as far as possible all those ills to which from mistake rather than any bad intentions he had himself so much contributed
another preacher after reproaching him to his face with his misgovernment ordered this psalm to be sung
great pains were taken by the scots and the english complied with their pretended delicacy to make this estimation and payment of arrears appear a quite different transaction from that for the delivery of the kings person but common sense requires that they should be regarded as one and the same
thus the scottish nation underwent and still undergo for such grievous stains are not easily wiped off the reproach of selling their king and betraying their prince for money
montrose also after having experienced still more variety of good and bad fortune threw down his arms and retired out of the kingdom
have we eaten at all of the kings cost
he was particularly attentive to the behavior of their preachers on whom all depended
what the parliament was most intent upon was not their treaty with the king to whom they paid little regard but that with the scots
the marquis of worcester a man past eighty four was the last in england that submitted to the authority of the parliament
two important points remained to be settled with that nation their delivery of the king and the estimation of their arrears
but if he put the inference by without a smile it was also without irritation
but that only made his little final auditory more compact and select kept it round the hearth subject to a common thrill

poor douglas before his deathwhen it was in sightcommitted to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that on the same spot with immense effect he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth
the awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took up all his time
wont you tell douglas somebody else inquired
he passed his hand over his eyes made a little wincing grimace
a womans
he quitted the fire and dropped back into his chair
nobody but me till now has ever heard
i can see douglas there before the fire to which he had got up to present his back looking down at his interlocutor with his hands in his pockets
oh yes dont grin i liked her extremely and am glad to this day to think she liked me too
mrs griffin however expressed the need for a little more light
to this his answer was prompt
he was handsome and bold and pleasant offhand and gay and kind
he continued to fix me

he had broken a thickness of ice the formation of many a winter had had his reasons for a long silence
he seemed to say it was not so simple as that to be really at a loss how to qualify it
the story wont tell said douglas not in any literal vulgar way
she was a most charming person but she was ten years older than i she was my sisters governess he quietly said she was the most agreeable woman ive ever known in her position she would have been worthy of any whatever
isnt anybody going
he had for his own town residence a big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase but it was to his country home an old family place in essex that he wished her immediately to proceed
if the child gives the effect another turn of the screw what do you say to two children
i shall have to send to town there was a unanimous groan at this and much reproach after which in his preoccupied way he explained
this person proved on her presenting herself for judgment at a house in harley street that impressed her as vast and imposingthis prospective patron proved a gentleman a bachelor in the prime of life such a figure as had never risen save in a dream or an old novel before a fluttered anxious girl out of a hampshire vicarage
it was long ago and this episode was long before
because the thing had been such a scare
from our end of the great brown hall we heard his step on the stair whereupon mrs griffin spoke
if she hadnt she wouldnt have told me
the last story however incomplete and like the mere opening of a serial had been told we handshook and candlestuck as somebody said and went to bed
it was this observation that drew from douglasnot immediately but later in the eveninga reply that had the interesting consequence to which i call attention someone else told a story not particularly effective which i saw he was not following
you are acute
well if i dont know who she was in love with i know who he was
it was almost the tone of hope
we say of course somebody exclaimed that they give two turns
she was ten years older said her husband
i was sure i could see
one could easily fix his type it never happily dies out
she had never told anyone
i took that herehe tapped his heart ive never lost it
she was in love
i adjured him to write by the first post and to agree with us for an early hearing then i asked him if the experience in question had been his own
then as he faced us again i cant begin
mores the pity then
oh how delicious cried one of the women
well then i said just sit right down and begin

also a draft on futurity sometimes honored but generally extended
presents and feasts had probably another origin than that of naive ostentation but they required their utility for this purpose very early and they have retained that character to the present so that their utility in this respect has now long been the substantial ground on which these usages rest
high bred manners and ways of living are items of conformity to the norm of conspicuous leisure and conspicuous consumption
he is no longer simply the successful aggressive malethe man of strength resource and intrepidity
closely related to the requirement that the gentleman must consume freely and of the right kind of goods there is the requirement that he must know how to consume them in a seemly manner
the livery becomes obnoxious to nearly all who are required to wear it
the same invidious distinction adds force to the current disapproval of any indulgence of this kind on the part of women minors and inferiors
as the group whose good esteem is to be secured in this way grows larger more patent means are required to indicate the imputation of merit for the leisure performed and to this end uniforms badges and liveries come into vogue
this most primitive differentiation in the consumption of goods is like the later differentiation with which we are all so intimately familiar in that it is largely of a ceremonial character but unlike the latter it does not rest on a difference in accumulated wealth
vicarious consumption by dependents bearing the insignia of their patron or master narrows down to a corps of liveried menials
they become his courtiers or retainers servants and being fed and countenanced by their patron they are indices of his rank and vicarious consumer of his superfluous wealth
the two offices last named suggest a principle of some general bearing
he consumes vicariously for his host at the same time that he is witness to the consumption of that excess of good things which his host is unable to dispose of single handed and he is also made to witness his hosts facility in etiquette
but facts within easy reach of any one who cares to know them go to say that the greater abstinence of women is in some part due to an imperative conventionality and this conventionality is in a general way strongest where the patriarchal traditionthe tradition that the woman is a chattelhas retained its hold in greatest vigour
in a heightened degree therefore the livery comes to be a badge of servitude or rather servility
we are yet so little removed from a state of effective slavery as still to be fully sensitive to the sting of any imputation of servility
but already at a point in economic evolution far antedating the emergence of the lady specialised consumption of goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a more or less elaborate system
therefore the base classes primarily the women practice an enforced continence with respect to these stimulants except in countries where they are obtainable at a very low cost
it has served as the norm to which consumption has tended to conform and any appreciable departure from it is to be regarded as an aberrant form sure to be eliminated sooner or later in the further course of development
in the nature of things luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisure class
it has even happened that the name for certain diseased conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonym for noble or gentle
as regards feasts and largesses this is obvious enough and the imputation of repute to the host or patron here takes place immediately on the ground of common notoriety
costly entertainments such as the potlatch or the ball are peculiarly adapted to serve this end
whenever as in these cases the menial service in question has to do directly with the primary leisure employments of fighting and hunting it easily acquires a reflected honorific character
infirmities induced by over indulgence are among some peoples freely recognised as manly attributes
so many of them however as make up the retainer and hangers on of the patron may be classed as vicarious consumer without qualification
this characterisation of the greater continence in the use of stimulants practised by the women of the reputable classes may seem an excessive refinement of logic at the expense of common sense
this antipathy asserts itself even in the case of the liveries or uniforms which some corporations prescribe as the distinctive dress of their employees
the competitor with whom the entertainer wishes to institute a comparison is by this method made to serve as a means to the end
in order to avoid stultification he must also cultivate his tastes for it now becomes incumbent on him to discriminate with some nicety between the noble and the ignoble in consumable goods
but the economic effect of these social amenities is not therefore lessened either in the vicarious consumption of goods or in the exhibition of difficult and costly achievements in etiquette
but that does not remain the sole purpose of their consumption
since the consumption of these more excellent goods is an evidence of wealth it becomes honorific and conversely the failure to consume in due quantity and quality becomes a mark of inferiority and demerit
the custom of festive gatherings probably originated in motives of conviviality and religion these motives are also present in the later development but they do not continue to be the sole motives
the canon of reputability is at hand and seizes upon such innovations as are according to its standard fit to survive
the aid of friends and competitors is therefore brought in by resorting to the giving of valuable presents and expensive feasts and entertainments
under the tabu certain victuals and more particularly certain beverages are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class
in a sense which has been greatly qualified in scope and rigour but which has by no means lost its meaning even yet this tradition says that the woman being a chattel should consume only what is necessary to her sustenanceexcept so far as her further consumption contributes to the comfort or the good repute of her master
the wearers of uniforms and liveries may be roughly divided into two classes the free and the servile or the noble and the ignoble
the objection of course presents itself that expenditure on womens dress and household paraphernalia is an obvious exception to this rule but it will appear in the sequel that this exception is much more obvious than substantial
those who stand near the higher and the highest grades of the wealthy leisure class in point of birth or in point of wealth or both outrank the remoter born and the pecuniarily weaker
in the earlier phases of the predatory culture the only economic differentiation is a broad distinction between an honourable superior class made up of the able bodied men on the one side and a base inferior class of labouring women on the other
in what has been said of the evolution of the vicarious leisure class and its differentiation from the general body of the working classes reference has been made to a further division of labourthat between the different servant classes
of course the distinction is not observed with strict consistency in practice the less debasing of the base services and the less honorific of the noble functions are not infrequently merged in the same person
this restriction tends to disappear at least formally after the later peaceable stage has been reached with private ownership of goods and an industrial system based on wage labour or on the petty household economy
hence results a class of impecunious gentlemen of leisure incidentally referred to already these half caste gentlemen of leisure fall into a system of hierarchical gradations
but during the earlier quasi peaceable stage when so many of the traditions through which the institution of a leisure class has affected the economic life of later times were taking form and consistency this principle has had the force of a conventional law
he becomes a connoisseur in creditable viands of various degrees of merit in manly beverages and trinkets in seemly apparel and architecture in weapons games dancers and the narcotics
this cultivation of aesthetic faculty requires time and application and the demands made upon the gentleman in this direction therefore tend to change his life of leisure into a more or less arduous application to the business of learning how to live a life of ostensible leisure in a becoming way
the consumption of choice articles of food and frequently also of rare articles of adornment becomes tabu to the women and children and if there is a base servile class of men the tabu holds also for them
his life of leisure must be conducted in due form
where the example set by the leisure class retains its imperative force in the regulation of the conventionalities it is observable that the women still in great measure practise the same traditional continence with regard to stimulants
during the earlier stages of economic development consumption of goods without stint especially consumption of the better grades of goodsideally all consumption in excess of the subsistence minimumpertains normally to the leisure class
when the quasi peaceable stage of industry is reached with its fundamental institution of chattel slavery the general principle more or less rigorously applied is that the base industrious class should consume only what may be necessary to their subsistence
many of these affiliated gentlemen of leisure are at the same time lesser men of substance in their own right so that some of them are scarcely at all others only partially to be rated as vicarious consumers
but a base service performed for a person of very high degree may become a very honorific office as for instance the office of a maid of honor or of a lady in waiting to the queen or the kings master of the horse or his keeper of the hounds
the services performed by them are likewise divisible into noble and ignoble
the utility of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivative growth
any such consumption by others can take place only on a basis of sufferance
but the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked
the beginning of a differentiation in consumption even antedates the appearance of anything that can fairly be called pecuniary strength it is traceable back to the initial phase of predatory culture and there is even a suggestion that an incipient differentiation in this respect lies back of the beginnings of the predatory life
he consumes freely and of the best in food drink narcotics shelter services ornaments apparel weapons and accoutrements amusements amulets and idols or divinities in the process of gradual amelioration which takes place in the articles of his consumption the motive principle and proximate aim of innovation is no doubt the higher efficiency of the improved and more elaborate products for personal comfort and wellbeing
the wearing of uniforms or liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and may even be said to be a mark of servitude real or ostensible
this growth of punctilious discrimination as to qualitative excellence in eating drinking etc presently affects not only the manner of life but also the training and intellectual activity of the gentleman of leisure
if these articles of consumption are costly they are felt to be noble and honorific
this invidious traditional distinction has not lost its force even among the more advanced peoples of today
this differentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility
hence arise good manners in the way pointed out in an earlier chapter
with a further advance in culture this tabu may change into simple custom of a more or less rigorous character but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it be a tabu or a larger conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily
the latter day leisure class festivities and entertainments may continue in some slight degree to serve the religious need and in a higher degree the needs of recreation and conviviality but they also serve an invidious purpose and they serve it none the less effectually for having a colorable non invidious ground in these more avowable motives
conspicuous consumption of valuable goods is a means of reputability to the gentleman of leisure
the consumption of luxuries in the true sense is a consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the master
on the other hand those employments which properly fall to the industrious class are ignoble such as handicraft or other productive labor menial services and the like
as wealth accumulates on his hands his own unaided effort will not avail to sufficiently put his opulence in evidence by this method
drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the free use of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become honorific as being a mark at the second remove of the superior status of those who are able to afford the indulgence
it is an adaption to a new end by a selective process of a distinction previously existing and well established in mens habits of thought
with many qualificationswith more qualifications as the patriarchal tradition has gradually weakenedthe general rule is felt to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters
from archaic times down through all the length of the patriarchal regime it has been the office of the women to prepare and administer these luxuries and it has been the perquisite of the men of gentle birth and breeding to consume them
as wealth accumulates the leisure class develops further in function and structure and there arises a differentiation within the class there is a more or less elaborate system of rank and grades
such consumption as falls to the women is merely incidental to their work it is a means to their continued labour and not a consumption directed to their own comfort and fulness of life
in the narrower sphere of vicarious leisure a similar change has gone forward
the early ascendency of leisure as a means of reputability is traceable to the archaic distinction between noble and ignoble employments leisure is honorable and becomes imperative partly because it shows exemption from ignoble labor
under the simple test of effectiveness for advertising we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary emulation pretty evenly between them at the outset
this latter day uneasy reaching out for some form of purposeful activity that shall at the same time not be indecorously productive of either individual or collective gain marks a difference of attitude between the modern leisure class and that of the quasi peaceable stage
a standard of life would still be possible which should admit of invidious comparison in other respects than that of opulence as for instance a comparison in various directions in the manifestation of moral physical intellectual or aesthetic force
the use of the word waste as a technical term therefore implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends sought by the consumer under this canon of conspicuous waste
when the community developed into a peaceful industrial organization and when fuller occupation of the land had reduced the opportunities for the hunt to an inconsiderable residue the pressure of energy seeking purposeful employment was left to find an outlet in some other direction
but the fact that it may under stress of circumstances eventuate in inanities no more disproves the presence of the instinct than the reality of the brooding instinct is disproved by inducing a hen to sit on a nestful of china eggs
the ignominy which attaches to useful effort also entered upon a less acute phase with the disappearance of compulsory labor and the instinct of workmanship then came to assert itself with more persistence and consistency
a reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is effected by a resort to make believe
but the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme
this alien factor is the instinct of workmanship
the instinct of workmanship is present in all men and asserts itself even under very adverse circumstances
no merit would accrue from the consumption of the bare necessaries of life except by comparison with the abjectly poor who fall short even of the subsistence minimum and no standard of expenditure could result from such a comparison except the most prosaic and unattractive level of decency
as seen from the point of view of the individual consumer the question of wastefulness does not arise within the scope of economic theory proper
so that however wasteful a given expenditure may be in reality it must at least have some colorable excuse in the way of an ostensible purpose
the subsequent relative decline in the use of conspicuous leisure as a basis of repute is due partly to an increasing relative effectiveness of consumption as an evidence of wealth but in part it is traceable to another force alien and in some degree antagonistic to the usage of conspicuous waste
the use of the term waste is in one respect an unfortunate one
the archaic differentiation into noble and ignoble classes is based on an invidious distinction between employments as honorific or debasing and this traditional distinction grows into an imperative canon of decency during the early quasi peaceable stage its ascendency is furthered by the fact that leisure is still fully as effective an evidence of wealth as consumption
in order to meet with unqualified approval any economic fact must approve itself under the test of impersonal usefulnessusefulness as seen from the point of view of the generically human
consumable goods and even productive goods generally show the two elements in combination as constituents of their utility although in a general way the element of waste tends to predominate in articles of consumption while the contrary is true of articles designed for productive use
leisure held the first place at the start and came to hold a rank very much above wasteful consumption of goods both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the quasi peaceable culture
but there are other standards of repute and other more or less imperative canons of conduct besides wealth and its manifestation and some of these come in to accentuate or to qualify the broad fundamental canon of conspicuous waste
as items which sometimes fall under this head and are therefore available as illustrations of the manner in which this principle applies may be cited carpets and tapestries silver table service waiters services silk hats starched linen many articles of jewelry and of dress
in order to be reputable it must be wasteful
throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure whether of goods or of services or human life runs the obvious implication that in order to effectually mend the consumers good fame it must be an expenditure of superfluities
for this is the basis of award of the instinct of workmanship and that instinct is the court of final appeal in any question of economic truth or adequacy
all extraneous considerations apart those persons adult are but a vanishing minority today who harbor no inclination to the accomplishment of some end or who are not impelled of their own motion to shape some object or fact or relation for human use
it is a question as to the award rendered by a dispassionate common sense
this extreme inhibition of industry is avoided because slave labor working under a compulsion more vigorous than that of reputability is forced to turn out a product in excess of the subsistence minimum of the working class
and along with the make believe of purposeful employment and woven inextricably into its texture there is commonly if not invariably a more or less appreciable element of purposeful effort directed to some serious end
indeed so effective is it in the relatively small and stable human environment to which the individual is exposed at that cultural stage that with the aid of the archaic tradition which deprecates all productive labor it gives rise to a large impecunious leisure class and it even tends to limit the production of the communitys industry to the subsistence minimum
in so far as it comes into conflict with the law of conspicuous waste the instinct of workmanship expresses itself not so much in insistence on substantial usefulness as in an abiding sense of the odiousness and aesthetic impossibility of what is obviously futile being of the nature of an instinctive affection its guidance touches chiefly and immediately the obvious and apparent violations of its requirements
the salient features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated
instead of simply passing her time in visible idleness as in the best days of the patriarchal regime the housewife of the advanced peaceable stage applies herself assiduously to household cares
but that canon of reputability which discountenances all employment that is of the nature of productive effort is still at hand and will permit nothing beyond the most transient vogue to any employment that is substantially useful or productive
it is only less promptly and with less constraining force that it reaches such substantial violations of its requirements as are appreciated only upon reflection
other circumstances permitting that instinct disposes men to look with favor upon productive efficiency and on whatever is of human use
this common sense implication is itself an outcropping of the instinct of workmanship
the test to which all expenditure must be brought in an attempt to decide that point is the question whether it serves directly to enhance human life on the whole whether it furthers the life process taken impersonally
from that point onward consumption has gained ground until at present it unquestionably holds the primacy though it is still far from absorbing the entire margin of production above the subsistence minimum
leisure might then be expected gradually to yield ground and tend to obsolescence as the economic development goes forward and the community increases in size while the conspicuous consumption of goods should gradually gain in importance both absolutely and relatively until it had absorbed all the available product leaving nothing over beyond a bare livelihood
if he chooses it that disposes of the question of its relative utility to him as compared with other forms of consumption that would not be deprecated on account of their wastefulness
it disposes them to deprecate waste of substance or effort
at the same time the wages in the trade are high enough to make movement from place to place relatively easy
the only practicable means of impressing ones pecuniary ability on these unsympathetic observers of ones everyday life is an unremitting demonstration of ability to pay
lower still where any degree of leisure even ostensible has become impracticable for the wife the conspicuous consumption of goods remains and is carried on by the wife and children
it is evident therefore that the present trend of the development is in the direction of heightening the utility of conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure
it is rather that the leisure class scheme of life here comes to an expression at the second remove
the exigencies of the modern industrial system frequently place individuals and households in juxtaposition between whom there is little contact in any other sense than that of juxtaposition ones neighbors mechanically speaking often are socially not ones neighbors or even acquaintances and still their transient good opinion has a high degree of utility
it is by no means an uncommon spectacle to find a man applying himself to work with the utmost assiduity in order that his wife may in due form render for him that degree of vicarious leisure which the common sense of the time demands
the requirement of conformity to this higher conventional standard becomes mandatory
it is not that the city population is by nature much more eager for the peculiar complacency that comes of a conspicuous consumption nor has the rural population less regard for pecuniary decency
but the provocation to this line of evidence as well as its transient effectiveness is more decided in the city
not that the results of her attention to household matters of a decorative and mundificatory character are not pleasing to the sense of men trained in middle class proprieties but the taste to which these effects of household adornment and tidiness appeal is a taste which has been formed under the selective guidance of a canon of propriety that demands just these evidences of wasted effort
the question is which of the two methods will most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desired to affect
the man of the household also can do something in this direction and indeed he commonly does but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigencealong the margin of the slumsthe man and presently also the children virtually cease to consume valuable goods for appearances and the woman remains virtually the sole exponent of the households pecuniary decency
the human proclivity to ostentation reenforced by sentiments of good fellowship leads them to spend freely in those directions which will best serve these needs
it is also noticeable that the serviceability of consumption as a means of repute as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency is at its best in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest
and here occurs a curious inversion
the result is that in order to keep up a decent appearance the former habitually live hand to mouth to a greater extent than the latter
it is a fact of common observance that in this lower middle class there is no pretense of leisure on the part of the head of the household
the inertia due to the home feeling is consequently also slight
but the middle class wife still carries on the business of vicarious leisure for the good name of the household and its master
no class of society not even the most abjectly poor forgoes all customary conspicuous consumption
the means of communication and the mobility of the population now expose the individual to the observation of many persons who have no other means of judging of his reputability than the display of goods and perhaps of breeding which he is able to make while he is under their direct observation
with the disappearance of servitude the number of vicarious consumers attached to any one gentleman tends on the whole to decrease
the basis on which good repute in any highly organized industrial community ultimately rests is pecuniary strength and the means of showing pecuniary strength and so of gaining or retaining a good name are leisure and a conspicuous consumption of goods
among the latter everybodys affairs especially everybodys pecuniary status are known to everybody else
usage has answered this question in different ways under different circumstances
each will therefore serve about equally well during the earlier stages of social growth
this vicarious consumption practiced by the household of the middle and lower classes can not be counted as a direct expression of the leisure class scheme of life since the household of this pecuniary grade does not belong within the leisure class
in descending the social scale in any modern industrial community the primary fact the conspicuous leisure of the master of the household disappears at a relatively high point
there is no class and no country that has yielded so abjectly before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual need
in the modern community there is also a more frequent attendance at large gatherings of people to whom ones everyday life is unknown in such places as churches theaters ballrooms hotels parks shops and the like
if beauty or comfort is achieved and it is a more or less fortuitous circumstance if they are they must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves to the great economic law of wasted effort
the more reputable presentable portion of middle class household paraphernalia are on the one hand items of conspicuous consumption and on the other hand apparatus for putting in evidence the vicarious leisure rendered by the housewife
the leisure rendered by the wife in such cases is of course not a simple manifestation of idleness or indolence
through force of circumstances it has fallen into disuse
but the derivative fact the vicarious leisure and consumption rendered by the wife and the auxiliary vicarious performance of leisure by menials remains in vogue as a conventionality which the demands of reputability will not suffer to be slighted
on grounds of expediency the preference may be given to the one or the other at different stages of the economic development
there goes into these domestic duties much solicitude for a proper combination of form and color and for other ends that are to be classed as aesthetic in the proper sense of the term and it is not denied that effects having some substantial aesthetic value are sometimes attained
so it comes for instance that the american farmer and his wife and daughters are notoriously less modish in their dress as well as less urbane in their manners than the city artisans family with an equal income
the last items of this category of consumption are not given up except under stress of the direst necessity
very much of squalor and discomfort will be endured before the last trinket or the last pretense of pecuniary decency is put away
in order to impress these transient observers and to retain ones self complacency under their observation the signature of ones pecuniary strength should be written in characters which he who runs may read
but as we descend the social scale the point is presently reached where the duties of vicarious leisure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone
pretty much all that is here insisted on is that as regards these amenities of life the housewifes efforts are under the guidance of traditions that have been shaped by the law of conspicuously wasteful expenditure of time and substance
consumption becomes a larger element in the standard of living in the city than in the country
the result is a great mobility of the labor employed in printing perhaps greater than in any other equally well defined and considerable body of workmen
it almost invariably occurs disguised under some form of work or household duties or social amenities which prove on analysis to serve little or no ulterior end beyond showing that she does not occupy herself with anything that is gainful or that is of substantial use
these home comforts and the leisure indulged inwhere the indulgence is foundare of course also in great part to be classed as items of conspicuous consumption and much the same is to be said of the savings
considered by itself simplytaken in the first degreethis added provocation to which the artisan and the urban laboring classes are exposed may not very seriously decrease the amount of savings but in its cumulative action through raising the standard of decent expenditure its deterrent effect on the tendency to save cannot but be very great
the effects are pleasing to us chiefly because we have been taught to find them pleasing
from the foregoing survey of the growth of conspicuous leisure and consumption it appears that the utility of both alike for the purposes of reputability lies in the element of waste that is common to both in the one case it is a waste of time and effort in the other it is a waste of goods
here as elsewhere prescription seizes upon the custom as soon as it gains a vogue and incorporates it in the accredited standard of decency
the choice between them is a question of advertising expediency simply except so far as it may be affected by other standards of propriety springing from a different source
the head of the middle class household has been reduced by economic circumstances to turn his hand to gaining a livelihood by occupations which often partake largely of the character of industry as in the case of the ordinary business man of today
these men are constantly thrown in contact with new groups of acquaintances with whom the relations established are transient or ephemeral but whose good opinion is valued none the less for the time being
in a general way though not wholly nor consistently these two groups coincide
this is especially true during the later peaceable economic stage
the observance of these standards in some degree of approximation becomes incumbent upon all classes lower in the scale
the peculiar habits of the class in this respect are commonly set down to some kind of an ill defined moral deficiency with which this class is credited or to a morally deleterious influence which their occupation is supposed to exert in some unascertainable way upon the men employed in it
this method is therefore more readily resorted to and in the struggle to outdo one another the city population push their normal standard of conspicuous consumption to a higher point with the result that a relatively greater expenditure in this direction is required to indicate a given degree of pecuniary decency in the city
the state of the case for the men who work in the composition and press rooms of the common run of printing houses may be summed up as follows skill acquired in any printing house or any city is easily turned to account in almost any other house or city that is to say the inertia due to special training is slight
the standard of decency is higher class for class and this requirement of decent appearance must be lived up to on pain of losing caste
both are methods of demonstrating the possession of wealth and the two are conventionally accepted as equivalents
among the country population its place is to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighborhood gossip sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of pecuniary repute
the leisure class stands at the head of the social structure in point of reputability and its manner of life and its standards of worth therefore afford the norm of reputability for the community
she bit her lip and looked down at her hands which were clasped tightly in front of her
its getting the better of me
she closed her eyes and took a deep breath as if to draw in again the fragrance of those days
he moved uneasily and his chair creaked
ill do anything you wish me to bartley she said tremulously
its too late to ask that
i landed at liverpool this morning and came down on the boat train
could youcould you sit down and talk about it quietly bartley as if i were a friend and not some one who had to be defied
hilda took a quick soft breath
you see loving some one as i love you makes the whole world different
i must have you to think of through the months and months of loneliness
bartley gave a bitter little laugh and hilda looked up and read in the deepening lines of his face that youth and bartley would not much longer struggle together
she slid to the floor beside him as if she were too tired to sit up any longer
at last alexander brought out one word
the sight of you bartley to see you living and happy and successfulcan i never make you understand what that means to me she pressed his shoulders gently
the first wassort of in play wasnt it
i must see you
he locked and unlocked his hands over the grate and spread his fingers close to the bluish flame while the coals crackled and the clock ticked and a street vendor began to call under the window
you ask me to stay away from you because you want me
yes i know im cowardly im afraid of myself
he stood his ground over by the windows until hilda came in
bartley youre cowardly
everything
oh what a grand thing to happen on a raw day
i cant he said heavily
i meant to but somehow i couldnt
the shamefulness of your asking me to do that
alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze
he looked at her and his haggard face softened
alexander did not sit down
but i didnt know
what about us bartley she asked in a thin voice
keep away if you wish when have i ever followed you
theres something troubling you bartley
dont cry dont cry he whispered
i can do that
he dropped back heavily into his chair by the fire
hildas face quivered but she whispered yes i think it must have been
hilda was pale by this time and her eyes were wide with fright
i thought it might be sister kate or cousin mike would be happening along
hilda held her face back from him and began to cry bitterly
its different now
i never dreamed it would be you bartley
something of their troubling sweetness came back to alexander too
he pulled up a window as if the air were heavy
what must i do that ive not done or what must i not do she listened intently but she heard nothing but the creaking of his chair
then came all those years without you lonely and hurt and discouraged those decent young fellows and poor mac and me never heedinghard as a steel spring
if id met you later if i hadnt loved you so wellbut thats all over long ago
hilda watched him with perplexity
if you come to me ill do as i see fit
just something bartley
it tortures me every minute
i wanted you always to be happy and handsome and successfulto have all the things that a great man ought to have and once in a way the careless holidays that great men are not permitted
please tell me one thing bartley
the stop at queenstown the tedious passage up the mersey were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience
she pushed him toward the big chair by the fire and sat down on a stool at the opposite side of the hearth her knees drawn up to her chin laughing like a happy little girl
im growing older and youve got my young self here with you
what i mean is that i want you to promise never to see me again no matter how often i come no matter how hard i beg
you and i
youve only to tell me now
bartley turned away and sank down in his chair again
i cant stand seeing you miserable
he put out his hand toward her as he looked away again into the fire
after the very first
you know
its unbearable
forget everything except that i am here
each life spoils the other
i felt it in my bones when i woke this morning that something splendid was going to turn up
bartley bent over and took her in his arms kissing her mouth and her wet tired eyes
i will do anything you saybut that
hilda sprang up like a flame
alexander rose and shook himself angrily
i will ask the least imaginable but i must have something
bartley bent lower over the fire
its got to be a clean break hilda
she crept across to him drawing her stool after her
come over to the fire youre chilled through
she blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs alexander paced up and down the hallway buttoning and unbuttoning his overcoat until she returned and took him up to hildas living room
there is this deception between me and everything
you want to tell me that you can only see me like this as old friends do or out in the world among people
but its worse now
no she gasped
you want me to say it she whispered
but why now she asked piteously wringing her hands
the last two days of the voyage bartley found almost intolerable
i got in about ten minutes ago
she called his name on the threshold but in her swift flight across the room she felt a change in him and caught herself up so deftly that he could not tell just when she did it she merely brushed his cheek with her lips and put a hand lightly and joyously on either shoulder
i wont promise
i get nothing but misery out of either
you see my mistake was in wanting you to have everything
i understand bartley
and then you came back not caring very much but it made no difference
but if you come to me ill do as i see fit
why didnt you let me be angry with you
and ive got nobody but you
she rose uncertainly touched his hair with her hand then sank back upon her stool
the world is all there just as it used to be but i cant get at it any more
i cant see you at all anywhere
yes yes she hurried pulling her hand gently away from him presently it stole back to his coat sleeve
at least tell me that you believe i thought i was making you happy
alexander groaned
weve tortured each other enough for tonight
emerging at euston at half past three oclock in the afternoon alexander had his luggage sent to the savoy and drove at once to bedford square
she looked at his heavy shoulders and big determined head thrust forward like a catapult in leash
it it hasnt always made you miserable has it her eyelids fell and her lips quivered
you havent spoken a word
do you understand
he rose and pushed the chair behind him and began to walk miserably about the room seeming to find it too small for him
always
he ignored her question
its abominable of you to ask me
she leaned her head against his arm and spoke softly
i must know about you
i wanted you to eat all the cakes and have them too
i have thought about it until i am worn out
a coal fire was crackling in the grate and the lamps were lit for it was already beginning to grow dark outside
i carried it all lightly enough at first but now i dont dare trifle with it
we had only a few days and your new play was just on and you were so happy
but why do you let me chatter on like this
she stood over him with her hands clenched at her side her body rigid
what is it
yes i was happy wasnt i she pressed his hand gently in gratitude werent you happy then at all
hilda shivered and sat still
bartley leaned his head in his hands and spoke through his teeth
i somehow believed that i could take all the bad consequences for you
the room was empty when he entered
hilda sat on the arm of it and put her hands lightly on his shoulders
i dont trust myself any more
she looked about desperately from bartley to the door then to the windows and back again to bartley
she doesnt take up with anybody you know
in appearance mainhall was astonishingly like the conventional stage englishman of american drama tall and thin with high hitching shoulders and a small head glistening with closely brushed yellow hair
the fact is shes feeling rather seedy poor child
i say
hes been wanting to marry hilda these three years and more
do you know alexandermainhall looked with perplexity up into the top of the hansom and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved fingerdo you know i sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself
i say sir harry the little girls going famously to night isnt she
after all we were awfully young
a little attack of nerves possibly
i should torture myselfi couldnt help it after that it was easy to forget actually to forget
when alexander returned to his hotelhe shook mainhall at the door of the theatrehe had some supper brought up to his room and it was late before he went to bed
and have i done anything so fool as that now he asked
after he met winifred pemberton he seemed to himself like a different man
and what an audience
she saves her hand too
she doubtless hasnt thought of me for years he felt the enthusiasm of the house at once and in a few moments he was caught up by the current of macconnells irresistible comedy
here comes sir harry towne
lady westmere is very fond of hilda
westmere and i were back after the first act and we thought she seemed quite uncertain of herself
macconnell grunted
shes really macconnells poetic motif you see makes the whole thing a fairy tale
i shouldnt wonder but theyve probably spoiled her so that shed be tiresome if one met her again
theres everything in seeing hilda while shes fresh in a part
for some reason he felt pleased and flattered by the enthusiasm of the audience
when she began to dance by way of showing the gossoons what she had seen in the fairy rings at night the house broke into a prolonged uproar
but i never thought shed do anything
mainhall laughed
dear me mac the girl couldnt possibly be better you know
a man writes to the top of his bent only once
sometimes a little jolt like that does one good
she was a daft generous little thing
the audience had come forewarned evidently and whenever the ragged slip of a donkey girl ran upon the stage there was a deep murmur of approbation every one smiled and glowed and mainhall hitched his heavy chair a little nearer the brass railing
its really quite the best thing macconnells done he explained as they got into a hansom
its only lately since macconnell and his set have got hold of her that shes come up
why i havent heard of her foryears
macconnell let me introduce mr bartley alexander
as they sat down a burst of applause drew alexanders attention to the stage
he had preconceived ideas about everything and his idea about americans was that they should be engineers or mechanics
sir harry towne mr bartley alexander the american engineer
as mainhall had said she was the second act the plot and feeling alike depended upon her lightness of foot her lightness of touch upon the shrewdness and deft fancifulness that played alternately and sometimes together in her mirthful brown eyes
the playwright gave mainhall a curious look out of his deep set faded eyes and made a wry face
but hilda burgoynes the hit of the piece hughs written a delightful part for her and shes quite inexpressible its been on only two weeks and ive been half a dozen times already i happen to have macconnells box for tonight or thered be no chance of our getting places
shes at her best in the second act
one of your countrymen alexander by the way an american student whom she met in paris i believe
its going famously to night mac
blinking up at the lights mainhall added in his luxurious worldly way shes an elegant little person and quite capable of an extravagant bit of sentiment like that
shes apt to grow a bit stale after a time
all the same he lifted his glass heres to you little hilda
the second act opened before philly doyles underground still with peggy and her battered donkey come in to smuggle a load of potheen across the bog and to bring philly word of what was doing in the world without and of what was happening along the roadsides and ditches with the first gleam of fine weather
just then they drove up to the duke of yorks so alexander did not commit himself but followed mainhall into the theatre
sir harry towne bowed and said that he had met mr alexander and his wife in tokyo
she hadnt much ambition then and she was too fond of trifles
alexander annoyed by mainhalls sighs and exclamations watched her with keen half skeptical interest
when they entered the stage box on the left the first act was well under way the scene being the interior of a cabin in the south of ireland
the nephew of one of the standard victorian novelists mainhall bobbed about among the various literary cliques of london and its outlying suburbs careful to lose touch with none of them
mainhall cut in impatiently
hilda had never replied to his letter
i dare say its quite true that theres never been any one else mainhall vouched for her constancy with a loftiness that made alexander smile even while a kind of rapid excitement was tingling through him
he bowed as the warning bell rang and mainhall whispered you know lord westmere of coursethe stooped man with the long gray mustache talking to lady dowle
it was youth and poverty and proximity and everything was young and kindly
its delightful to hear it in a london theatre
irene burgoyne one of her family told me in confidence that there was a romance somewhere back in the beginning
perhaps she has me to thank for something after all
in a way it would be a sacrifice but dear me we do need some one
hes another whos awfully keen about her
hes hit terribly hard
of course he reflected she always had that combination of something homely and sensible and something utterly wild and daft
he nodded curtly and made for the door dodging acquaintances as he went
she must care about the theatre a great deal more than she used to
youll never do anything like this again mark me
bartley smiled and yawned and went to bed
he had been in london more or less but he had never happened to hear of her
that laugh now when she doubles over at the hipswho ever heard it out of galway
when he wrote her that everything was changed for him he was telling the truth
its tremendously well put on too
youve made things come your way and i never thought youd do it
they met a good many acquaintances mainhall indeed knew almost every one and he babbled on incontinently screwing his small head about over his high collar
he was never so witty or so sharp here as elsewhere and alexander thought he behaved as if he were an elderly relative come in to a young girls party
she did my blouses beautifully the last time i was there and was so delighted to see me again
have i told you about my new play
i dont need marie to dress me this season so she keeps house for me and my little galway girl has gone home for a visit i should never have asked you if molly had been here for i remember you dont like english cookery
you see im coming on
good night
ive managed to save something every year and that with helping my three sisters now and then and tiding poor cousin mike over bad seasons
this isnt fair you know
her hair is still like flax and her blue eyes are just like a babys and she has the same three freckles on her little nose and talks about going back to her bains de mer
hilda curtsied
he drank it appreciatively and remarked that there was still no other he liked so well
they dont talk of any one else as they do of you
ask a theatre lady if shes afraid of drafts hilda laughed
i dont drink it myself but i like to see it behave when its poured
arent you afraid to let the wind low like that on your neck
dear me why did you do that
they were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the money god give you a happy love
hilda laughed and went over to the piano
alexander caught the agitation in her voice
its not particularly rare she said but some of it was my mothers
im so pleased that you think me worth that yellow dress you know he said taking her hand and looking her over admiringly from the toes of her canary slippers to her smoothly parted brown hair
are you going to let me love you a little bartley she whispered
too bad
you have traveled you say
no it isnt a dress up part
youve got awfully nice friends he added humbly picking up a little jade elephant from her desk
they have all grown very smart
they asked him to come to see them in chelsea and they spoke very tenderly of hilda
i hope so
bartley recognized the primrose satin gown she had worn that first evening at lady walfords
he had a long talk with macconnell but he got no word with hilda alone and he left in a discontented state of mind
its owing to that same chance by the way that i am able to ask you to dinner
hes a big handsome creature and he hates americans as much as ever
it was not in the ingratiating tone of the habitual beggar it had come out of the depths of the poor creatures sorrow vibrating with pity for their youth and despair at the terribleness of human life it had the anguish of a voice of prophecy
it was very jolly he murmured lazily as marie came in to take away the coffee
we always had our tea out of those blue cups when i was a little girl sometimes in the queerest lodgings and sometimes on a trunk at the theatrequeer theatres for that matter
lady westmere sent them to me from rome last christmas
well he is still clever and lazy
what a strong brown face she had and very tragic
until she spoke bartley had not realized that he was in love the strange woman and her passionate sentence that rang out so sharply had frightened them both
he sent up his card but it came back to him with a message scribbled across the front
heaven knows how she managed to keep it whole through all our wanderings or in what baskets and bundles and theatre trunks it hasnt been stowed away
though marie is cleanreally clean as the french are
well we are neither of us twenty now you know
good night
when they reached the house where hilda lodged bartley went across the court with her and up the dark old stairs to the third landing and there he had kissed her for the first time
have you been in paris much these late years
bartley leaned over her shoulder without touching her and whispered in her ear you are giving me a chance
most actresses nowadays learn to sing properly so i tried a master but he confused me just
he found it a delightful little place and he met charming people there
thank you
alexander arrived early and some twenty odd people dropped in during the course of the afternoon
i gave her all my old clothes even my old hats though she always wears her breton headdress
she caught his handkerchief from her throat and thrust it at him without turning round
how jolly it was being young hilda
she sat down at the piano and sang
i have some champagne for you too
hilda saw alexander look up at it
alexander walked about the room looking at everything
there was watercress soup and sole and a delightful omelette stuffed with mushrooms and truffles and two small rare ducklings and artichokes and a dry yellow rhone wine of which bartley had always been very fond
how did her son turn out
i was frightened at your prodigality
alexander walked over to the bookcases
h b
indeed i do
hilda was writing in her living room under the light of a tall desk lamp
listen
hilda sat down on the couch and said seriously ive a neat little sum in the bank too now and i own a mite of a hut in galway
the editor of a monthly review came with his wife and lady kildare the irish philanthropist brought her young nephew robert owen who had come up from oxford and who was visibly excited and gratified by his first introduction to miss burgoyne
its the air of the whole place here that i like
chapter four
here take it
bartley started when hilda rang the little bell beside her
there arent many such left
i cant tell you how glad i am to have you so pretty and comfortable here and to hear every one saying such nice things about you
im so sorry to hear it
i would have given her some of mine off my back if i could
for the rest of the week he was nervous and unsettled and kept rushing his work as if he were preparing for immediate departure
ive no need for fine clothes in macs play this time so i can afford a few duddies for myself
do you remember how sweet they smelled
of course i cant really sing except the way my mother and grandmother did before me
i remember it touched me so
hilda lived alone attended by a very pretty and competent french servant who answered the door and brought in the tea
bartley looked at hilda across the yellow light of the candles and broke into a low happy laugh
nonsense
hilda seemed particularly fond of this quaint couple and bartley himself was so pleased with their mild and thoughtful converse that he took his leave when they did and walked with them over to oxford street where they waited for their bus
hes that gifted you know but he will drink and loses more good engagements than other fellows ever get
there is nothing else that looks so jolly
and ive traveled a bit too
but perhaps as im so warmgive me your handkerchief
but i dont like it so well as this bartley held the yellow wine against the light and squinted into it as he turned the glass slowly about
its not worth much but i love it
theyre quite unusual arent they
mac is writing one really for me this time
hilda laughed and looked at him questioningly
every one at lady walfords was looking at it
did she ever get back to brittany and her bains de mer
yes
it was a tiny room hung all round with french prints above which ran a shelf full of china
hilda started up from the stool and moved restlessly toward the window its really too warm in this room to sing
we walked on down by the river didnt we
take it and go
he painted that group of cypresses for the salon and it was bought for the luxembourg
on thursday afternoon he cut short a committee meeting jumped into a hansom and drove to bedford square
dont you feel it
he stood a little behind her and tried to steady himself as he said its soft and misty
on sunday afternoon alexander remembered miss burgoynes invitation and called at her apartment
oh yes i go over to paris often
they went home sadly with the lilacs back to the rue saint jacques walking very slowly arm in arm
alexander went back to bedford square a second sunday afternoon
hilda lowered one of the candle shades carefully
but angeldo you remember angel
when bartley arrived at bedford square on sunday evening marie the pretty little french girl met him at the door and conducted him upstairs
he seemed to have made a resolute effort at tidiness of attire and his sister a robust florid woman with a splendid joviality about her kept eyeing his freshly creased clothes apprehensively
i havent had a chance yet to tell you what a jolly little place i think this is
you used to sing it so well
for a long time neither hilda nor bartley spoke
sarah frost the novelist came with her husband a very genial and placid old scholar who had become slightly deranged upon the subject of the fourth dimension
there are few changes in the old quarter
all the same sing it hilda
isnt london a tomb on sunday night
hugh macconnell came with his sister and stood about managing his tea cup awkwardly and watching every one out of his deep set faded eyes
i gave her a spray of lilac i remember and you gave her a franc
american tours have spoiled them im afraid
marie got them all fresh in covent garden market yesterday morning
on other matters he was perfectly rational and he was easy and pleasing in conversation
alexander went over and opened the window for her
when she finished alexander shook himself out of a reverie
i had quite forgotteni was back there
he had shut his eyes to give him the courage he remembered and she had trembled so
im glad said alexander simply
lamb wouldnt care a great deal about many of them i fancy
see how white the stars are
she looked at us with such despair and longing out from under her black shawl
but hes given me some good irish songs
what kind of a part is it
dont i though
marie opened the door and smilingly announced that dinner was served
it was on the quai we met that woman who was crying so bitterly
where did you get those etchings
cant i get a scarf or something
rooms always look better by lamplightin london at least
do you remember that first walk we took together in paris
you must go now bartley
shall you wear yellow gowns
what she wanted from us was neither our flowers nor our francs but just our youth
my dining room hilda explained as she led the way is the tiniest place you have ever seen
i expect it was the last franc i had
hans pointed with his finger at a dark mass six hundred yards away rising and falling alternately with heavy plunges
the remainder of the sea monsters have disappeared
i looked at the hunter
during his watch i slept
at three hundred yards from us the battle was fought
the shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves
yet we are going very fast
only his long neck shoots up drops again coils and uncoils droops lashes the waters like a gigantic whip and writhes like a worm that you tread on
no surely it cannot be
the reptiles rose they wheeled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express trains
my uncle took soundings several times
look at its vast jaws and its rows of teeth
what two
the horizon seems extremely distant
and yet what cause was there for anger
the struggle continues with unabated ferocity
no not at all
i looked and cried
it is diving down
yes replied my uncle and there is a sea lizard of vast size
but when the pick was shipped again hans pointed out on its surface deep prints as if it had been violently compressed between two hard bodies
they burdened this earth a thousand ages before man appeared but their fossil remains found in the argillaceous limestone called by the english the lias have enabled their colossal structure to be perfectly built up again and anatomically ascertained
but it now seems to me as if the other animals were taking part in the fraythe porpoise the whale the lizard the tortoise
i could not take my eyes off this indented iron bar
but soon the reptiles agony draws to an end its movements become fainter its contortions cease to be so violent and the long serpentine form lies a lifeless log on the labouring deep
and the other
did he cross it
all at once an enormous head is darted up the head of the plesiosaurus
the wind freshens
the water is splashed for a long way around
is not the raft spinning along with marvellous speed
yes indeed those are the marks of teeth imprinted upon the metal the jaws which they arm must be possessed of amazing strength
the raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again at a distance of twenty fathoms
the world then belonged to reptiles
teeth i cried considering the iron bar with more attention
impatient then
we stood amazed thunderstruck at the presence of such a herd of marine monsters
i prepare to fire
its body is entirely covered with a thick armour of scales and its neck as flexible as a swans rises thirty feet above the waves
my head is still stupefied with the vivid reality of my dream
chapter thirty three
you seem anxious my uncle i said seeing him continually with his glass to his eye
surely you must be mistaken i cried
we remain motionless ready to fire
one might be with less reason than now
no human eye has ever beheld them living
i was possessed with an apprehension lest the electric light should grow dim or fail altogether
they possessed a perfect organisation gigantic proportions prodigious strength
i took up my rifle
hans had spoken truly
the plesiosaurus a serpent with a cylindrical body and a short tail has four flappers or paddles to act like oars
my uncle has had no dreams but he is out of temper
i take this as my answer and i leave the professor to bite his lips with impatience
we must be on the look out
the two beasts are fast locked together i cannot distinguish the one from the other
suddenly the ichthyosaurus and the plesiosaurus disappear below leaving a whirlpool eddying in the water
i then remembered that the professor before starting had estimated the length of this underground sea at thirty leagues
the combatants alternately approach and recede from our raft
i return to the icelander
weather unchanged
two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me
what does that signify
i suppose professor liedenbrock was of my opinion too and even shared my fears for after having examined the pick his eyes traversed the ocean from side to side
flight was out of the question now
he examines the horizon all round with his glass and folds his arms with the air of an injured man
several minutes pass by while the fight goes on under water
that is just the question
therefore dont talk to me about views and prospects
i came with an object and i mean to attain it
they were of supernatural dimensions the smallest of them would have crunched our raft crew and all at one snap of its huge jaws
but i remarked since we have followed the road that saknussemm has shown us
i can distinguish the eye of the ichthyosaurus glowing like a red hot coal and as large as a mans head
have we followed that road
have we struck land
the danger is approaching
i am not complaining that the rate is slow but that the sea is so wide
but i dont care for prospects
we stood dumb with fear
i saw at the hamburg museum the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in length
at any rate we cannot feel sorry to have come so far
yet the deep marks of conical teeth upon the iron pick are certainly those of the crocodile
i no longer see his scaly armour
it must be as wide as the mediterranean or the atlanticand why not
my uncle notices it and looks on approvingly
i look at our guns and see that they are all right
two monsters only were creating all this commotion and before my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive world
we are not descending as we ought to be the professor declares we are losing time and the fact is i have not come all this way to take a little sail upon a pond on a raft
what a very bad notion that was of his i thought to myself to take soundings just here
i had rather not disturb him while he is quiet
hans was at the helm
he shakes his head negatively
no the first of those monsters has a porpoises snout a lizards head a crocodiles teeth and hence our mistake
on awaking my first thought was to observe the intensity of the light
a battle of monsters
the spray almost blinds us
i can see its great fins
suppose that solid roof should crumble down upon our heads
the sail stretches tight like a bubble ready to burst
the wind has risen and has rapidly carried us away from axel island
at noon the violence of the storm redoubles
the roarings become lost in the distance
theres a heavy storm coming on i cried pointing towards the horizon
but before it has reached us the rain cloud parts asunder the sea boils and the electric fires are brought into violent action by a mighty chemical power that descends from the higher regions
our mouths open our lips move but not a word can be heard
he has laid a firm hold upon a rope and appears to watch with grim satisfaction this awful display of elemental strife
in the distance the clouds resemble great bales of cotton piled up in picturesque disorder
we have been carried under england under the channel under france perhaps under the whole of europe
the atmosphere is charged with vapours pervaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of saline waters
sunday twenty threewhere are we
is it riveted to the planks
it rushes on from the farthest recesses of the vast cavern
are we still under the sea
he nods his consent
he can only spare time to shrug his shoulders viciously
a suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air it enters the throat it fills the lungs
at ten in the morning the symptoms of storm become aggravated
the night was fearful no abatement of the storm
the heaving waves resemble fiery volcanic hills each belching forth its own interior flames and every crest is plumed with dancing fire
the atmosphere is evidently charged and surcharged with electricity my whole body is saturated my hair bristles just as when you stand upon an insulated stool under the action of an electrical machine
those clouds seem as if they were going to crush the sea
let the wind catch us if it will
never
they seem to be we are lost but i am not sure
at last i write down the words let us lower the sail
i could just see my uncle at full length on the raft and hans still at his helm and spitting fire under the action of the electricity which has saturated him
alas the fall upon our fated raft of this electric globe has magnetised every iron article on board
my eyes fail under the dazzling light my ears are stunned with the incessant crash of thunder
driven forward with a swiftness that cannot be measured
the instruments the tools our guns are clashing and clanking violently in their collisions with each other the nails of my boots cling tenaciously to a plate of iron let into the timbers and i cannot draw my foot away from the spot
an electric storm
the clouds are sinking lower and assume an olive hue
the lightning flashes with intense brilliancy and never seems to cease for a moment
i must be bound to the mast which bows like a reed before the mighty strength of the storm
such is their ponderous weight that they cannot rise from the horizon but obeying an impulse from higher currents their dense consistency slowly yields
where
is the atmospheric condition having once reached this density to become final
i refer to the thermometer it indicates the figure is obliterated
we have made two hundred leagues since we left axel island
the rudder stands motionless in a sluggish waveless sea
my uncle has drawn nearer to me
chapter thirty five
i have only been able to find a few which i seem to have jotted down almost unconsciously
but where are we going to
the sail the sail i cry motioning to lower it
ah what a flood of intense and dazzling light the globe has burst and we are deluged with tongues of fire
we suffer stifling pains
but hans is as usual the raft bears on still to the southeast
we are prostrated and worn out with fatigue
we lay there our blood running cold with unspeakable terror
the darkness deepens scarcely can i jot down a few hurried notes
i am loth to believe these atmospheric menaces and yet i cannot help muttering
his temper is awful to judge from the working of his features as he sees this vast length of ocean unrolling before him to an indefinite extent
the professor made no answer
a fresh noise is heard
a deep silence falls on all around
the helm makes a bound
each of us is lashed to some part of the raft
other flashes with incessant play cross their vivid fires while others again roll themselves into balls of living fire which explode like bombshells but the music of which scarcely adds to the din of the battle strife that almost deprives us of our senses of hearing and sight the limit of intense loudness has been passed within which the human ear can distinguish one sound from another
we are obliged to secure as fast as possible every article that belongs to our cargo
the fireball half of it white half azure blue and the size of a ten inch shell moved slowly about the raft but revolving on its own axis with astonishing velocity as if whipped round by the force of the whirlwind
the heat increases
his long hair blown by the pelting storm and laid flat across his immovable countenance makes him a strange figure for the end of each lock of loose flowing hair is tipped with little luminous radiations
i feel peculiar sensations like many creatures on earth at the approach of violent atmospheric changes
we cannot even make ourselves heard by approaching our mouth close to the ear
from the under surface of the clouds there are continual emissions of lurid light electric matter is in continual evolution from their component molecules the gaseous elements of the air need to be slaked with moisture for innumerable columns of water rush upwards into the air and fall back again in white foam
from time to time a fleecy tuft of mist with yet some gleaming light left upon it drops down upon the dense floor of grey and loses itself in the opaque and impenetrable mass
scarcely has he lifted his head again before a ball of fire has bounded over the waves and lighted on board our raft
my uncle falls full length i creep close to him
no no never shouted my impetuous uncle
hans stirs not
and now my turn comes pale and trembling under the blinding splendour and the melting heat it drops at my feet spinning silently round upon the deck i try to move my foot away but cannot
then all the light disappears
but their very brevity and their obscurity reveal the intensity of the excitement which dominated me and describe the actual position even better than my memory could do
mast and sail flew up in an instant together and i saw them carried up to prodigious height resembling in appearance a pterodactyle one of those strong birds of the infant world
on the mast already i see the light play of a lambent st elmos fire the outstretched sail catches not a breath of wind and hangs like a sheet of lead
my uncle lies full length across the raft
the lately roaring winds are hushed into a dead calm nature seems to breathe no more and to be sinking into the stillness of death
the piled up vapours condense into water and the air put into violent action to supply the vacuum left by the condensation of the mists rouses itself into a whirlwind
yes we are borne at incalculable speed
the wind never lulls but to acquire increased strength the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts and rushing storms
it seems to me as if my companions the moment they touched me would receive a severe shock like that from an electric eel
our family always hated cats nasty low vulgar things
we wont talk about her any more if youd rather not
im sure those are not the right words said poor alice and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on i must be mabel after all and i shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play with and oh ever so many lessons to learn
so she called softly after it mouse dear
good bye feet for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off oh my poor little feet i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears
how queer everything is to day
you ought to be ashamed of yourself said alice a great girl like you she might well say this to go on crying in this way
the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright oh i beg your pardon cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animals feelings
would it be of any use now thought alice to speak to this mouse everything is so out of the way down here that i should think very likely it can talk at any rate theres no harm in trying so she began o mouse do you know the way out of this pool
as if i would talk on such a subject
i almost think i can remember feeling a little different
well perhaps not said alice in a soothing tone dont be angry about it
oh dear what nonsense im talking
and yesterday things went on just as usual i wonder if ive been changed in the night
itll be no use their putting their heads down and saying come up again dear i shall only look up and say who am i then
we indeed cried the mouse who was trembling down to the end of his tail
that will be a queer thing to be sure however everything is queer to day
and how odd the directions will look
let me think was i the same when i got up this morning
i shall never get to twenty at that rate however the multiplication table doesnt signify lets try geography london is the capital of paris and paris is the capital of rome and romeno thats all wrong im certain
would you like cats if you were me
im sure im not ada she said for her hair goes in such long ringlets and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all and im sure i cant be mabel for i know all sorts of things and she oh
i am so very tired of being all alone here
the pool of tears
no ive made up my mind about it if im mabel ill stay down here
let me see ill give them a new pair of boots every christmas
and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah i think youd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her
chapter two
just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself
how can i have done that she thought
a little bright eyed terrier you know with oh such long curly brown hair
not like cats cried the mouse in a shrill passionate voice
dont let me hear the name again
let me see four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times seven isoh dear
i must have been changed for mabel
ill try if i know all the things i used to know
as she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbits little white kid gloves while she was talking
curiouser and curiouser cried alice she was so much surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english now im opening out like the largest telescope that ever was
poor alice
yes give me the orgeat
my new friend was a poet as i was he was an admirer of italian literature while i admired the french
the badauds who never fail to congregate near the carriage of princes no matter if they have seen them a hundred times or if they know them to be as ugly as monkeys repeated the words of the duchess everywhere and that was enough to send here all the snuff takers of the capital in a hurry
martelli composed a satire against maffei in which he designated him by the anagram of femia
i have the best italian poets
i shall call you esprit
without milk
i have it sir
you are mad she has given birth to a princess
i laugh heartily
well sir we never make coffee but in the afternoon would you like a good bavaroise or a decanter of orgeat
excellent i made it myself yesterday
here go and get me change for a louis
my remark pleases him but i soon prove to him that it is not the right way to speak however perfect may have been the language of that ancient writer
i address him in italian and he answers very wittily but his way of speaking makes me smile and i tell him why
balettis father who had just recovered from a long illness was not with us but we had his fathers sister who was older than mario
quite the reverse for it was a cunning artifice on her part
the milk is very good
after his visit i told esprit to take me to the palais royal and i left him at the gates
but sir how shall i find a teacher
in order to please her i spoke to her of the abbe conti and i had occasion to quote two lines of that profound writer
therefore it is not a paradox to say that the french would be wiser if they were less witty
milk
well
she held her tongue but from that time she told everybody that i was an impostor
i never drink any
i thanked him but i was not deceived by his compliment
make me a cup of fresh coffee without milk
the expression of crebillons face was that of the lions or of the cats which is the same thing
you may be quite sure its there said captain battleax and that i can so use it as to half obliterate your town within two minutes of my return on board
you will perceive captain battleax that there is a little difference of opinion between us all here as to the ceremony which was to have been accomplished this morning
their masters said mrs neverbend
no doubt in process of time the ladies will follow
i did not mean said captain battleax to touch upon public subjects at such a moment as this
and yet that something must be playful in its nature
jack had been standing in the far corner of the room talking to eva and was now reduced to silence by his praises
but how can a little state but a few years old situated on a small island far removed from all the centres of civilisation contend on any point with the owner of the great two hundred fiftyton swiveller gun
it is simply a contest between brute strength and mental energy
the john bright is armed with a weapon of great power against which it is impossible that the people of britannula should prevail
after that there was no attempt at speaking
we had received details of the whole affair by water telegram before the john bright started
but what is the delicate mission i asked
we sat with the officers some little time after dinner and then went ashore
i simply bowed to him
now in spite of what the captain said i undoubtedly had intended to make a speech
lieutenant crosstrees is a very gallant officer
now at the close of the twentieth century could oppression be carried to such a height as this
alas
i was to be taken away and carried to england or elsewhereor drowned upon the voyage it mattered not which
mrs neverbend should come with me or stay if it so pleased her in gladstonopolis
of what mrs neverbend had gone through in providing birds beasts and fishes not to talk of tarts and jellies for the dinner of that day no one but myself can have any idea but it must be admitted that she accomplished her task with thorough success
on myself i need hardly say that it would be inoperative
government that he shall be treated with all respect and that those honours shall be paid to him which are due to the president of a friendly republic
i remained there alone for many hours but i must acknowledge that before i left the chambers i had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light
there was captain battleax seated there beautiful with a cocked hat and an epaulet and gold braid
this was the first complimentary speech which sir ferdinando had made and i must confess that it was efficacious
but you must be aware that it has been our intention to interfere with that which you must regard as the performance of a duty
the country has since undoubtedly prospered and in a material point of view has given us no grounds for regret
it is therefore desired that you should endeavour to obtain information as to his intentions and that if the fixed period be not abandoned altogether with a clear conviction as to its cruelty on the part of the inhabitants generally you should cause him to be carried away and brought to england
what worldwide iniquity such a speech as that discloses said i still turning myself to the captain for though i would have crushed them both by my words had it been possible my dislike centred itself on sir ferdinando
but i blushed for its untruth
and what hope had there been what reasonable expectation that the system should have been allowed fair play
minister of the day thought it expedient to grant their request
in the meantime my friend captain battleax has below a guard of fifty marines who will pay you the respect of escorting you on board with two of the ships cutters
in regard to mr neverbend himself it is the especial wish of h m
he was dressed in simple black and was clearly not one of the ships officers but i could not but suspect at the moment that he was in some special measure concerned in the mission on which the gunboat had been sent he sat on mrs neverbends left hand and did seem in some respect to be the chief man on that occasion
and that in opposition to the wishes as i understand of a large proportion of your fellow citizens
no doubtknowing nothing of the forms of our government or
how much of evilof real accomplished evilhad there not occurred to me during the last few days
we are quite satisfied now captain battleax said my wife
that having all been pleasantly settled said sir ferdinando with a smile i will ask you to read the document by which this duty has been placed in my hands he then took out of his pocket a letter addressed to him by the duke of hatfield as minister for the crown colonies and gave it to me to read
if so you must be content to take my dead body
chapter nine
we have already lighted our fires and our sailors are weighing the anchors
had eva crasweller not been good looking had jack been still at college had sir kennington oval remained in england had mr bunnit and the bar keeper not succeeded in stopping my carriage on the hillshould i have succeeded in arranging for the final departure of my old friend
therefore we can be courteous while we submit
this was a pretty little speech enough and received the eager compliments of the officers of the john bright
i thought for a little what answer it would best become me to give to this question but i paused only for a moment or two
at any rate my eloquence was altogether stopped the gentleman was named sir ferdinando brown
all this i could hardly explain to him as i should thus be giving to him the strongest evidence against my own philosophy
when this captain should have taken himself and his vessel back to england i would retire to a small farm which i possessed at the farthest side of the island and there in seclusion would i end my days
and even had i succeeded in carrying my success so far as that should i not have appeared a murderer to my fellow citizens had not his departure been followed in regular sequence by that of all others till it had come to my turn had crasweller departed and had the system then been stopped should i not have appeared a murderer even to myself
then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives who were for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies
and now he continued will you answer me one question
with this the two gentlemen left the room
your promised bride seems to have it all her own way said captain battleax to jack when at last the ladies had withdrawn
i wept to think that a spirit of honesty should as yet have prevailed so little in the world
lieutenant crosstrees has sealed orders and is practically acquainted with the mechanism of the gun
if you will look at the contests throughout the world said sir ferdinando you will generally find that the highest respect is paid to the greatest battalions
it is quite impossible
and immediately on his sitting down there got up a gentleman to whom i had not been introduced before this day and gave the health of mrs neverbend and the ladies of britannula
i am sure we are all delighted to hear the ladies speak in so pleasant a manner said first lieutenant crosstrees an officer with whom i have since become particularly intimate
will twelve oclock suit you
i must by no means show in such company as was now present the strong feeling which pervaded my own mind
this i felt was paid to me as being president of the republic and i endeavoured to behave myself with such mingled humility and dignity as might befit the occasion but i could not but feel that something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordinary life
it is a duty said i but your power is so superior to any that i can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace in yielding to it
at the present moment a law has been passed which if carried into action would become abhorrent to mankind at large
that is all quite true mr neverbend said sir ferdinando brown
but on the whole we are a prosperous and well satisfied people
and this plan was adopted too in order to extract from me a promise that i would depart in peace at any rate i did make the promise and gave these two gentlemen my word that i would be present there in my own room in the executive chambers at the same hour on the day but one following
mr president said he i am in command of her majestys gunboat the john bright and i have come to pay my respects to the ladies
and i looking at the matter from my own point of view was a husband the head of a family a man largely concerned in businessi was to be carried away in bondagei who had done no wrong had disobeyed no law who had indeed been conspicuous for my adherence to my duties
what would become of your gun were i to kidnap you
when the president of the republic has his health drunk it is i conceive his duty to do so
to enable you to effect this captain battleax of h m gunboat the john bright has been instructed to carry you out
to day i shouted
and you are i am aware sufficiently popular with the people here to enable you to do so
though you should reduce me to atoms from them would spring those opinions which would serve altogether to silence your artillery
he was quiet and i might almost say silent during the whole evening but i could see from the testimony of his altered countenance how strong is the passion for life that dwells in the human breast
a presentiment indeed
i have come to your shores mr president with the purpose of seeing how things are progressing in this distant quarter of the world
jack would become evas happy husband and would remain amidst the hurried duties of the eager world crasweller the triumphant would live and at last die amidst the flocks and herds of little christchurch
then we began to think of the hospitality of the island and the officers of the john bright were asked to dine with us on the following day
they of course must all be altered
every hope for which i had lived as i then told myself had been brought to sudden extinction by the coming of these men to whom i had been so pleasant and who in their turn had been so pleasant to me
captain battleax of the john bright will have received a letter to the same effect from the first lord of the admiralty and you will find him ready to cooperate with your excellency in every respecti have the honour to be sir your excellencys most obedient servant
it seemed to me as he entered the room and took the chair that was offered to him that he was the greater man of the two on the occasionor perhaps i should say of the three and yet he had not before come on shore to visit me nor had he made one at our little dinner party
then there was a little pause in the conversation and i felt myself bound to say something as to the violent interruption to which i had this morning been subjected
i am here only to pay my respects as a messenger from great britain to britannula to congratulate you all on your late victory at cricket and to say how loud are the praises bestowed on mr john neverbend junior for his skill and gallantry
half past ten said the captain looking at his watch
things were progressing captain battleax pretty well before this morning
it is always well to be on the safe side
this i read with great attention while they sat silent
had the telegraph been invented in the days of ancient rome would the romans have accepted it or have stoned wheatstone so thinking i resolved that i was before my age and that i must pay the allotted penalty
however he proposed mrs neverbends health and the ladies and the captain instantly called upon the band to play some favourite tune
very well put said sir ferdinando
therefore i feel myself quite able as president of this republic to receive you with a courtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally
it seemed as though i were treated with almost royal honour
quite satisfied said eva
i did once or twice during the festivity glance round at old crasweller
the crooked magician
i would like to do that
the magician is very busy as i said but if you will promise not to disturb him you may come into his workshop and watch him prepare a wonderful charm
a patchwork girl
at the foot of the mountain that separated the country of the munchkins from the country of the gillikins the path divided
yes it is perfection she declared
it is good dame margolotte
there was a savory stew smoking hot a dish of blue peas a bowl of sweet milk of a delicate blue tint and a blue pudding with blue plums in it
ojo dressed
perhaps the powder of life couldnt either said ojo
instead of shoes the old man wore boots with turnover tops and his blue coat had wide cuffs of gold braid
but in other parts of oz the people favor different colors
but tell me please what you intend to do with this new lot of the powder of life which dr pipt is making
i want it to bring my patchwork girl to life
and in the munchkin country she exclaimed
i do not know how but you must keep the matter in mind and perhaps the chance will come to you she replied
the woman seemed thoughtful
how can i lose that un dame margolotte
i think i must show you my patchwork girl said margolotte laughing at the boys astonishment for she is rather difficult to explain
then it must be somewhere in the blue forest
i will show you what a good job i did and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors
i never knew i was called the unlucky said ojo soberly but it is really a good name for me
yes for a munchkin
he said his wife wanted it for some especial purpose
what is a patchwork quilt asked ojo
then they started on again and two hours later came in sight of the house of dr pipt
for a long time he had wished to explore the beautiful land of oz in which they lived
we are traveling replied ojo and we stopped at your house just to rest and refresh ourselves
one way led to the left and the other to the rightstraight up the mountain
what is that ojo asked for this seemed even more strange and unusual than a glass cat
is blue the only respectable color then inquired ojo
oh
we have come from a far lonelier place than this
ah said ojo you must be dame margolotte the good wife of dr pipt
a lonelier place
do you wish to see dr pipt on business or for pleasure
all our country is blue you know
ojo was hungry though so he divided the piece of bread upon the table and ate his half for breakfast washing it down with fresh cool water from the brook
ojo was well pleased
thank you replied the boy much pleased
what did old mombi the witch do with the powder of life your husband gave her asked the boy
and you must be ojo the unlucky she added
the more one knows the luckier he is for knowledge is the greatest gift in life
a glass cat exclaimed ojo astonished
she brought jack pumpkinhead to life for one thing was the reply i suppose youve heard of jack pumpkinhead
has she any brains asked ojo
well that may be true agreed margolotte but on the contrary a servant with too much brains is sure to become independent and high and mighty and feel above her work
a little cleverness
little said he
but the magician replied
what does the liquid of petrifaction do inquired the boy
i want her to know just enough but not too much
but just then there came a scratching at the back door and a shrill voice cried
he means explained ojo that unless your servant has good brains she wont know how to obey you properly nor do the things you ask her to do
margolotte had first made the girls form from the patchwork quilt and then she had dressed it with a patchwork skirt and an apron with pockets in itusing the same gay material throughout
come and help me
ingenuity amiability
the patchwork girl was taller than he when she stood upright and her body was plump and rounded because it had been so neatly stuffed with cotton
most people talk too much so it is a relief to find one who talks too little
chapter three
ask like a good cat then she said
yes thats proper cat talk declared the woman and opened the door
i am not allowed to perform magic except for my own amusement he told his visitors as he lighted a pipe with a crooked stem and began to smoke
magic must be a very interesting study said ojo
dont you find it very annoying to be so crooked he asked
this powder must not be used before to morrow morning but i think it is now cool enough to be bottled
all the fingers and thumbs of the girls hands had been carefully formed and stuffed and stitched at the edges with gold plates at the ends to serve as finger nails
when the mixture was complete there was scarcely a handful all told
no i am quite proud of my person was the reply
very carefully he placed the powder of life in the gold bottle and then locked it up in a drawer of his cabinet
she will have to work when she comes to life said margolotte
i know but that renders your uncle a most agreeable companion and gossip declared dr pipt
if i get tired looking at her patched face i can whitewash it
the head of the patchwork girl was the most curious part of her
it truly is asserted the magician
it will never break nor wear out
no i am sure i am right about that returned the woman
quick margolotte
no one saw him do this for all were looking at the powder of life but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing and came back to the cupboard
learning truth
what one useful thing could i do for a living for the support of mother and the children
she was tired of other things
but that wise and placid woman understood the sweet rebel a great deal better than ruth understood herself
ruth sat quite still for a time with face intent and flushed
i should think so you innocent puss and in an old one too
it is a city of steady thrift the arms of which might well be the deliberate but delicious terrapin that imparts such a royal flavor to its feasts
that evening ruth and her father sat late by the drawing room fire as they were quite apt to do at night
how far
any departure from either color or shape would be instantly taken note of
i know i can go through the whole clinics dissecting room and all
the rather common place and unformed hand writing seemed to him peculiar and characteristic different from that of any other woman
ruth turned square round to her mother and with an impassive face and not the slightest change of tone said
well mother said the young student looking up with a shade of impatience
mother thee knows i couldnt stand it at westfield the school stifled me its a place to turn young people into dried fruit
but he only said
friend eli who had long ago laid aside the quaker dress and was out of meeting and who in fact after a youth of doubt could not yet define his belief nevertheless looked with some wonder at this fierce young eagle of his hatched in a friends dove cote
is he going to start a daily newspaper among the kick a poos
thy ways greatly try me ruth and all thy relations
was she thinking about philip as she gazed across the fresh lawn over the tree tops to the chelton hills or of that world which his entrance into her tradition bound life had been one of the means of opening to her
she had begun her open battle
i have nothing to wear replied that demure person
and besides suppose thee does learn medicine
no i dont feel at home there
philip has gone to the far west
i hope at least ruth thee will let us know when thee opens an office said her mother with an approach to sarcasm that she rarely indulged in as she rose and left the room
i know said margaret bolton with a half anxious smile thee chafes against all the ways of friends but what will thee do
this excellent advice did not seem to impress ruth greatly for she was looking away with that abstraction of vision which often came into her grey eyes and at length she exclaimed with a sort of impatience
the letter that philip sterling wrote to ruth bolton on the evening of setting out to seek his fortune in the west found that young lady in her own fathers house in philadelphia
if i go to meeting at all i like best to sit in the quiet old house in germantown where the windows are all open and i can see the trees and hear the stir of the leaves its such a crush at the yearly meeting at arch street and then theres the row of sleek looking young men who line the curbstone and stare at us as we come out
she tried this morning an air or two upon the piano sang a simple song in a sweet but slightly metallic voice and then seating herself by the open window read philips letter
has thee consulted thy mother about a career i suppose it is a career thee wants
is thee going to the yearly meeting ruth asked one of the girls
it was one of the pleasantest of the many charming suburban houses in that hospitable city which is territorially one of the largest cities in the world and only prevented from becoming the convenient metropolis of the country by the intrusive strip of camden and amboy sand which shuts it off from the atlantic ocean
thee has another letter from young sterling said eli bolton
i will practice it
chapter fourteen
whats the good father of a series of human beings who dont advance any
if thee wants to see new bonnets orthodox to a shade and conformed to the letter of the true form thee must go to the arch street meeting
i want to be something to make myself something to do something
ruth asked the enthusiasts if they would like to live in such a sounding mausoleum with its great halls and echoing rooms and no comfortable place in it for the accommodation of any body
the truth is that the country cousins had come to town to attend the yearly meeting and the amount of shopping that preceded that religious event was scarcely exceeded by the preparations for the opera in more worldly circles
it was a spring morning and perhaps it was the influence of it that made ruth a little restless satisfied neither with the out doors nor the in doors
think of the stone shingles of the roof eight inches thick
why should i ive been again and again
a slight frail girl like thee study medicine does thee think thee could stand it six months
i hope thee told the elders that father and i are responsible for the piano and that much as thee loves music thee is never in the room when it is played
and then there was broad street
if i can get patients
whatever she thought she was not idly musing as one might see by the expression of her face
somewhat that depends upon whether her children amount to anything retorted the sharp little disputant
hes going into business
philip liked the letter as he did everything she did but he had a dim notion that there was more about herself in the letter than about him
and the lectures and the dissecting rooms has thee thought of the dissecting rooms
she also had a history possibly and had sometime beaten her young wings against the cage of custom and indulged in dreams of a new social order and had passed through that fiery period when it seems possible for one mind which has not yet tried its limits to break up and re arrange the world
does thee think i lack nerve
it was time for him to do something
and thee wont go
but ruth confessed that she was tired of them and also of the mint
but thy health and strength child thee can never stand the severe application
if they were orphans would they like to be brought up in a grecian temple
he took it with him from the southern hotel when he went to walk and read it over and again in an unfrequented street as he stumbled along
i wanted to talk with thee a little about thy plans
it was out now
if i must say it mother i want to go away and get out of this dead level
father i should like to break things and get loose
i have not asked him ruth replied with a look that might imply that she was one of those determined little bodies who first made up her own mind and then compelled others to make up theirs in accordance with hers
and if i had a fortune would thee want me to lead a useless life
he doesnt say but its on the frontier and on the map everything beyond it is marked indians and desert and looks as desolate as a wednesday meeting
her sisters had gone to the city to show some country visitors independence hall girard college and fairmount water works and park four objects which americans cannot die peacefully even in naples without having seen
mother said ruth calmly i have thought it all over
where thee and thy family are known
fortunately father is already out of meeting so they cant discipline him
yes
margaret bolton almost lost for a moment her habitual placidity
ruth
has thy mother led a useless life
wasnt it the broadest and the longest street in the world
what a sweet voiced little innocent it was to be sure
what sort of business can a young man go into without capital
ruth did not reply directly she complained that her mother didnt understand her
the sight seers returned in high spirits from the city
why should i rust and be stupid and sit in inaction because i am a girl what would happen to me if thee should lose thy property and die
ruth was glad to hear that philip had made a push into the world and she was sure that his talent and courage would make a way for him she should pray for his success at any rate and especially that the indians in saint louis would not take his scalp
why is thee so discontented
i heard father tell cousin abner that he was whipped so often for whistling when he was a boy that he was determined to have what compensation he could get now
after a time she took up a book it was a medical work and to all appearance about as interesting to a girl of eighteen as the statutes at large but her face was soon aglow over its pages and she was so absorbed in it that she did not notice the entrance of her mother at the open door
what is there to fear in a person dead more than in a person living
he well knew the perils of the frontier the savage state of society the lurking indians and the dangers of fever
but in what capacity would i go
happy youth that is ready to pack its valise and start for cathay on an hours notice
the fact was though philip sterling did not know it that he wanted several other things quite as much as he wanted wealth
he would say good night but not good bye
he is embarrassed which to choose and is not unlikely to waste years in dallying with his chances before giving himself to the serious tug and strain of a single object
he never was so summoned but none of his acquaintances would have been surprised to hear any day that he had gone to panama or peoria or to hear from him that he had bought the bank of commerce
he had brown hair hazel eyes set wide apart a broad but not high forehead and a fresh winning face
why its in missouri somewhere on the frontier i think
if he returned with a fortune perhaps and perhaps
well why dont you go into something
field engineer civil engineer
to his uncle he said that he had made an arrangement with some new york capitalists to go to missouri in a land and railroad operation which would at least give him a knowledge of the world and not unlikely offer him a business opening
it was settled therefore in the prompt way in which things are settled in new york that they would start with the rest of the company next morning for the west
no its not too soon
he has no traditions to bind him or guide him and his impulse is to break away from the occupation his father has followed and make a new way for himself
it was in this time of rather impatient waiting that philip was one morning walking down broadway with henry brierly
yes but what is it for what is it all about
that party is going to succeed its going to elect the next president
he had no friend wise enough to tell him to step into the dorking convention then in session make a sketch of the men and women on the platform and take it to the editor of the daily grapevine and see what he could get a line for it
if they disapprove thought he ive done my duty by letting them know
philip had a good appetite a sunny temper and a clear hearty laugh
no time or distance however would ever lessen his interest in her
why dont you see
its easy enough
we wouldnt engineer long
he frequently accompanied henry part way down town to what the latter called his office in broad street to which he went or pretended to go with regularity every day
it seemed to him that the newspaper managers didnt want genius but mere plodding and grubbing
but philip did afford it and he wrote thanking his friends and declining because he said the political scheme would fail and ought to fail
but there was no real danger to a person who took care of himself
well get a map
i was afraid it was nearer home
might he write to her often and tell her of his life
he would make his mark in literature
besides philip hated the copying of pleadings and he was certain that a life of whereases and aforesaids and whipping the devil round the stump would be intolerable
it seems to be easier than it is i begin to think replied philip
when do you go was philips next question after some moments of silence
if he were good enough he would attach himself to that company of young men in the theological seminary who were seeing new york life in preparation for the ministry
chapter twelve
the two were intimate at that timethey had been classmatesand saw a great deal of each other
to the young american here or elsewhere the paths to fortune are innumerable and all open there is invitation in the air and success in all his wide horizon
if he was unsuccessful or if he never returnedperhaps it would be as well
indeed they lived together in ninth street in a boarding house there which had the honor of lodging and partially feeding several other young fellows of like kidney who have since gone their several ways into fame or into obscurity
delightful illusion of paint and tinsel and silk attire of cheap sentiment and high and mighty dialogue
i think i should like it of all things replied philip with some hesitation but what for
his pen therefore and whereas and not as aforesaid strayed off into other scribbling
never mind the map
philip never was fortunate enough to hear what would become of a man who should lay his hand on a woman with the exception named but he learned afterwards that the woman who lays her hand on a man without any exception whatsoever is always acquitted by the jury
we will find the place itself
youll never dig it out of the astor library
well make it that
philip sterling used to say that if he should seriously set himself for ten years to any one of the dozen projects that were in his brain he felt that he could be a rich man
well im going as an engineer
in an unfortunate hour he had two or three papers accepted by firstclass magazines at three dollars the printed page and behold his vocation was open to him
and he went back to his books and to his waiting for an opening large enough for his dignified entrance into the literary world
he wouldnt bother her with business details but he hoped that the day was not far off when she would see him return with a moderate fortune and something to add to the comfort of her advancing years
oh its easy enough to make a fortune henry said
oh its a big operation
philip therefore read diligently in the astor library planned literary works that should compel attention and nursed his genius
the night was spent in packing up and writing letters for philip would not take such an important step without informing his friends
take it of course says gringo take anything that offers why not
but they want me to make it an opposition paper
you can begin by carrying a rod and putting down the figures
he wanted to be rich he had a sincere desire for a fortune but for some unaccountable reason he hesitated about addressing himself to the narrow work of getting it
philip wrote a long letter first of all to his mother full of love and glowing anticipations of his new opening
on the way up town these adventurers bought books on engineering and suits of india rubber which they supposed they would need in a new and probably damp country and many other things which nobody ever needed anywhere
he might never see her again he went to seek his fortune
o very well said gringo turning away with a shade of contempt youll find if you are going into literature and newspaper work that you cant afford a conscience like that
we are going a lot of us railroad men engineers contractors
it was to ruth bolton that philip wrote last
to morrow
you know my uncle is a great railroad man
he knew his uncle would be glad to hear that he had at last turned his thoughts to a practical matter
i dont know an engine from a coal cart
will there not always be rosin enough for the squeaking fiddle bow
he wanted to begin at the top of the ladder
the other teachers were indistinct personalities always very busy and very tired and talking school room with their meals
but its prettiest when the bolls come and swell and burst and the cotton covers the field like foam all misty
goobers answered the smaller boy
she started thinking of cottonbut at once she pulled herself back to the other aspect
but from the offer that came to teach negroescountry negroes and little ones at thatshe shrank and indeed probably would have refused it out of hand had it not been for her queer brother john
bles was now laughing outright
he harkened
and so howsoever reluctantly she had gone
peanuts bles specified
you ought to know john if i teach negroes ill scarcely see much of people in my own class
been looking up tooms county
of course it isnti dont know anything about farming
not that she objected to negroes as human beingsquite the contrary
miss mary taylor did not take a college course for the purpose of teaching negroes
so for the hundredth time she was thinking today as she walked alone up the lane back of the barn and then slowly down through the bottoms
i suppose though its too early for them
miss smith represented the older new england of her parentshonest inscrutable determined with a conscience which she worshipped and utterly unselfish
but john theres no societyjust elementary work
but what did i say so funny
he grasped his hoe and started briskly to work
she began to realize that in this pleasant little chat the fact of the boys color had quite escaped her and what especially puzzled her was that this had not happened before
goobers uncomprehendingly
she reddened drew herself up and then dropping her primness rippled with laughter
but here in alabama brought closely and intimately in touch with these dark skinned children their color struck her at first with a sort of terrorit seemed ominous and forbidding
she had pictured herself earning this by teaching one or two of her specialties in some private school near new york or boston or even in a western college
give em your greekand study cotton
the golden fleeceits the silver fleece
might learn something useful down there
at any rate i say go
the poetry of the thing began to sing within her awakening her unpoetic imagination and she murmured
is that so
she wanted a glance of the new books and periodicals and talk of great philanthropies and reforms
she paused
his eyes lighted for cotton was to him a very real and beautiful thing and a lifelong companion yet not one whose friendship had been coarsened and killed by heavy toil
no maam he said eagerly then glancing up toward the cresswell fields he saw two white men watching them
nevertheless when the end of the summer came and the only opening facing her was the teaching of children at miss smiths experiment in the alabama swamps it must be frankly confessed that miss taylor was disappointed
whats the mere color of a human souls skin she had cried to a wellesley audience and the audience had applauded with enthusiasm
she glanced absently at the boys
the glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered and murmured before her stretching away to the northward she remembered that beyond this little world it stretched on and onhow far she did not knowbut on and on in a great trembling sea and the foam of its mighty waters would one time flood the ends of the earth
cotton is a wonderful thing is it not boys she said rather primly the boys touched their hats and murmured something indistinctly
some others too big cotton county
nonsense
he looked at her with twinkling eyes
miss taylor did not know much about cotton but at least one more remark seemed called for
the south she had not thought of seriously and yet knowing of its delightful hospitality and mild climate she was not averse to charleston or new orleans
always before she had been veiled from these folk who had put the veil there
the longer she thought the more bewildered she grew
i declare
she appealed to miss taylors ruddier and daintier vision but dimly and distantly as some memory of the past
and bleswas miss taylor deceivedor was he chuckling
then her new england conscience stepped in
then came the explosion
what is planted over there she asked although she really didnt care
miss taylor was soon starving for human companionship for the lighter touches of life and some of its warmth and laughter
she groped for new ways to teach colored brains and marshal colored thoughts and the result was puzzling both to teacher and student
she felt out of the world shut in and mentally anaemic great as the negro problem might be as a world problem it looked sordid and small at close range
the word was often on miss taylors lips and she recognized it
show off
oh murmured miss taylor
he gazed about perplexed astonished
she stood on the island ethereal splendid like some tall dark and gorgeous flower of the storied east
miss smith he gasped and thendarkness
here lay the reading of the riddle with infinite work and pain some one had dug a canal from the lagoon to the creek into which the former had drained by a long and crooked way thus allowing it to empty directly
he heard that she was down stairs and ran to meet her with beating heart
so the world was happy and the face of the black belt green and luxuriant with thickening flecks of the coming foam of the cotton
the rain drops were still dripping and gleaming from the trees flashing back the heavy yellow sunlight
after some days they let her sit by the window and she saw bles pass but drew back timidly when he looked and he saw only the flutter of her gown and waved
the dark mystery of the swamp swept over her the place was hers
child
the silver fleece how was it
the hope and dream of harvest was upon the land
what a field of cotton what a marvellous field
bles did not know yet that she was down but soon he would come searching for he came each hour and she pressed her little hands against her breast to still the beating of her heart and the bursting wonder of her love
where was the use of imagining
then suddenly a panic seized her
the earth staggered beneath him as he stumbled on the mud splashed and sunlight glistened he saw long snakes slithering across his path and fear struck beasts fleeing before his coming
up in the sick room zora lay on the little white bed
the swamp the eternal swamp had been drained in its deepest fastness but howhow
he skirted the island slowly stopping near zoras oak
a great white foam was spread upon its brown and green the whole field was waving and shivering in the sunlight
yet it was far and he feared and ran with startled eyes
the sun the swamp then finding all well she closed her eyes and slept
there she laywet bedraggled motionless gray pallid beneath her dark drawn skin her burning eyes searching restlessly for some lost thing her lips a moaning
he came down to her slowly with fixed hungry eyes threading his way amid the fleece
bles rushed to the edge of the swamp and stood there irresolute
perhaps she too might be there waiting weeping
he splashed and stamped along farther and farther onward until he neared the rampart of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge
he hurried forth sadly
she did not move but lifted both her dark hands white with cotton and then as he came casting it suddenly to the winds in tears and laughter she swayed and dropped quivering in his arms
he started at the thought
then he looked down
the cotton crop was short and poor because of the great rain but the sun had saved the best and the price had soared
to her all things meant somethingnothing was aimless nothing merely happened
the chair was empty but he knew
the net and web of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her she had struggled in dumb speechless terror against some mighty grasping that strove for her life with gnarled and creeping fingers but now at last weakly she opened her eyes and questioned
perhapsif the water had but drained from the cottonit was so strong and tall but p shaw
the lagoon was dry
a great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place and beneath lay a mighty mass of olive green thick tall wet and willowy
positively heroic added cresswell avoiding his sisters eyes
they all glanced at miss cresswell who lay softly back in her chair like a white lily gleaming and bejewelled her pale face flushing under the scrutiny mrs grey was horrified
what did you disagree about she asked bluntly
the door opened softly
it was a most agreeable couple of hours all save perhaps mr smith unbent the englishman especially and the vanderpools were most gracious but if the general pleasure was owing to any one person particularly it was to mr harry cresswell
mr cresswell inclined his head courteously
she was not herself a notably intelligent woman she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence in others
mrs greys chef was high priced and efficient and her butler was the envy of many consequently she knew the dinner would be good
very soon after dinner charles smith excused himself
the price he had paid was high he was to represent the interests of the new trust and sundry favorable measures were already drafted and reposing in the safe of the combines legal department
there was young cresswell
but mr cresswell you surely believe in schools like miss smiths
mr cresswell explained
but cresswell added significantly capacity differs enormously between races
but you mean to say you cant even advise her
he had tried independence and philanthropy and failed
fortunately said mr vanderpool northerners and southerners are arriving at a better mutual understanding on most of these matters
mrs grey wanted to hear the incident but the young man was politely reluctant
they were gentlemen
oh no we can
to her intense satisfaction it was far more than this
really now you do not mean to say that there is a danger ofof amalgamation do you he sang
yes indeed cresswell agreed
at last the cotton combine was to all appearances an assured fact and he was slated for the senate
there was just the touch of early autumn chill in the air without that made both the fire and the table with its soft linen gold and silver plate and twinkling glasses a warming satisfying sight
why i thought said mrs grey that you southerners rather disapprovedor at least
i believe in the training of people to their highest capacity the englishman here heartily seconded him
mr cresswell sipped his wine slowly
i thought the only excuse for fighting was a great right if right is on neither side or simultaneously on both then war is not only hell but damnation
no of course there was no immediate danger but when people were suddenly thrust beyond their natural station filled with wild ideas and impossible ambitions it meant terrible danger to southern white women
mrs grey wanted particulars
among others was one relating to child labor another that would effect certain changes in the tariff and a proposed law providing for a cotton bale of a shape and dimensions different from the customarythe last constituting a particularly clever artifice which under the guise of convenience in handling would necessitate the installation of entirely new gin and compress machinery to be supplied of course by the trust
after all why should he care
why should he pose as better than his fellows
why should he not be as other men
then mary taylor whose conscience was uncomfortable said
mrs grey was gratified and murmured something of miss smiths sacrifice
mrs grey looked shocked and mrs vanderpool smiled
did his aristocratic air prevent his succumbing to the lure of millions and promising the influence of his father and the whole farmers league to the new project
go to her
amedee will be a handsome bridegroom
i was going to give you a lift if you were done she gathered up her reins
from the graveyard gate one can count a dozen gayly painted farmhouses the gilded weather vanes on the big red barns wink at each other across the green and brown and yellow fields
it gives itself ungrudgingly to the moods of the season holding nothing back
alexandra lets you sleep late
why arent they up in the catholic graveyard
it hurts their feelings if you dont
one june morning a young man stood at the gate of the norwegian graveyard sharpening his scythe in strokes unconsciously timed to the tune he was whistling
they still jaw about it in history classes
like the plains of lombardy it seems to rise a little to meet the sun
oh theres a good boy she turned her head to him with a quick bright smile
when you go out of the house into the flower garden there you feel again the order and fine arrangement manifest all over the great farm in the fencing and hedging in the windbreaks and sheds in the symmetrical pasture ponds planted with scrub willows to give shade to the cattle in fly time
the old wild country the struggle in which his sister was destined to succeed while so many men broke their hearts and died he can scarcely remember
there were so many sheds and outbuildings grouped about it that the place looked not unlike a tiny village
neighboring fields
telephone wires hum along the white roads which always run at right angles
wed do it right over again most of us said the young woman hotly
just wait till i finish off the kourdnas by the way they were bohemians
indeed he had looked away with the purpose of not seeing it
when he had been mowing the better part of an hour he heard the rattle of a light cart on the road behind him
there is even a white row of beehives in the orchard under the walnut trees
marie shabata settled herself in her seat and watched the rhythmical movement of the young mans long arms swinging her foot as if in time to some air that was going through her mind
free thinkers replied the young woman laconically
maybe the supper will tempt him
the cart stopped at the gate and a merry contralto voice called almost through emil he dropped his scythe and went toward the fence wiping his face and neck with his handkerchief in the cart sat a young woman who wore driving gauntlets and a wide shade hat trimmed with red poppies
he was a splendid figure of a boy tall and straight as a young pine tree with a handsome head and stormy gray eyes deeply set under a serious brow
a stranger approaching it could not help noticing the beauty and fruitfulness of the outlying fields
from the norwegian graveyard one looks out over a vast checker board marked off in squares of wheat and corn light and dark dark and light
the wheat cutting sometimes goes on all night as well as all day and in good seasons there are scarcely men and horses enough to do the harvesting
the rich soil yields heavy harvests the dry bracing climate and the smoothness of the land make labor easy for men and beasts
here ive been to town and back
any one thereabouts would have told you that this was one of the richest farms on the divide and that the farmer was a woman alexandra bergson
on either side of the road for a mile before you reached the foot of the hill stood tall osage orange hedges their glossy green marking off the yellow fields
the space between his two front teeth which were unusually far apart gave him the proficiency in whistling for which he was distinguished at college he also played the cornet in the university band
his wife now lies beside him and the white shaft that marks their graves gleams across the wheat fields
lots of the bohemian boys at the university are said emil taking up his scythe again
the shaggy coat of the prairie which they lifted to make him a bed has vanished forever
he felt it rather than saw it
the grain is so heavy that it bends toward the blade and cuts like velvet
is anybody but you going to stand up with him
i gave old man lee a cut or so too
oh you know annie she looked at the young mans bare arms
he wore a flannel cap and duck trousers and the sleeves of his white flannel shirt were rolled back to the elbow
her face too was rather like a poppy round and brown with rich color in her cheeks and lips and her dancing yellow brown eyes bubbled with gayety
there was something individual about the great farm a most unusual trimness and care for detail
how do you know they think that
lous wife neednt talk
one room is papered carpeted over furnished the next is almost bare
i get wet to my knees when i go down to pick cherries
when the grass required his close attention or when he had to stoop to cut about a head stone he paused in his lively airthe jewel songtaking it up where he had left it when his scythe swung free again
but i will be in a minute
supposing that it was his sister coming back from one of her farms he kept on with his work
she shook her head at the tall youth
alexandra sent me to mow our lot but ive done half a dozen others you see
she sat with the ease that belongs to persons of an essentially happy nature who can find a comfortable spot almost anywhere who are supple and quick in adapting themselves to circumstances
marie clucked to her horse
they drove westward toward norway creek and toward a big white house that stood on a hill several miles across the fields
if once i get frank to the supper ill see that i stay for the dance
please wait for me marie emil coaxed
all angeliques folks are baking for it and all amedees twenty cousins
the pleasantest rooms in the house are the kitchenwhere alexandras three young swedish girls chatter and cook and pickle and preserve all summer longand the sitting room in which alexandra has brought together the old homely furniture that the bergsons used in their first log house the family portraits and the few things her mother brought from sweden
the wind was flapping her big hat and teasing a curl of her chestnut colored hair
the divide is now thickly populated
if you go up the hill and enter alexandras big house you will find that it is curiously unfinished and uneven in comfort
the air and the earth are curiously mated and intermingled as if the one were the breath of the other
thats not much of a job for an athlete
will you
oh theres no denying youre a spunky little bunch you czechs he called back over his shoulder
there will be barrels of beer
yet sometimes in the pauses of his work the young man frowned and looked at the ground with an intentness which suggested that even twenty one might have its problems
you must dance with all the french girls
unconscious respect probably for he seemed intent upon his own thoughts and like the gladiators they were far away
what time did you get over here
how brown youve got since you came home
that is all among the dim things of childhood and has been forgotten in the brighter pattern life weaves to day in the bright facts of being captain of the track team and holding the interstate record for the high jump in the all suffusing brightness of being twenty one
they think youre proud because youve been away to school or something
i wish i had an athlete to mow my orchard
lous wife was telling me about the way she spoils you
ive been up looking at angeliques wedding clothes marie went on and im so excited i can hardly wait until sunday
could he rise from beneath it he would not know the country under which he has been asleep
you feel that properly alexandras house is the big out of doors and that it is in the soil that she expresses herself best
he was not thinking about the tired pioneers over whom his blade glittered
that wont last
oh i dont mean all of them i mean that low place down by my tree where there are so many
the old people in the mountains plant lindens to purify the forest and to do away with the spells that come from the old trees they say have lasted from heathen times
she sighed despondently
almost anything you choose
its then that i want to pull the corners of the divide together
i like to talk to carl about new york and what a fellow can do there
didnt it blow dreadfully
dont you
it will go away and things will be just as they used to i wish you were a catholic
frank sat up until a late hour reading the sunday newspapers
and anyhow theres nothing to understand she struck the ground with her little foot fiercely
i suppose thats the wet season too then
emil had already begun work and was mowing vigorously
he reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet insipid fruitlong ivory colored berries tipped with faint pink like white coral that fall to the ground unheeded all summer through
when i heard it raining in the night i thought maybe you would come and do it for me to day
look at the spider webs all over the grass
she had grown very pale and her eyes were shining with excitement and distress but emil if i understand then all our good times are over we can never do nice things together any more
thank you he returned shortly
oh but im glad to get this place mowed
just smell the wild roses
emil paused and straightened his back
would you rather i went off in the sand hills and lived like ivar
i suppose its the wet season
the idea
sometimes i dont want to do anything at all and sometimes i want to pull the four corners of the divide togetherhe threw out his arm and brought it back with a jerkso like a table cloth
surely you are not thinking of going off there
thats a poor saying said emil stooping over to wipe his hands in the wet grass
south of the apricot trees cornering on the wheatfield was franks alfalfa where myriads of white and yellow butterflies were always fluttering above the purple blossoms
maries face fell under his brooding gaze
what more do you want
i dont know
yes over
im a good catholic but i think i could get along with caring for trees if i hadnt anything else
yes
i like him because he appreciates her more than you do
the church helps people indeed it does
in a few moments he heard the cherries dropping smartly into the pail and he began to swing his scythe with that long even stroke that few american boys ever learn
in printing the story of the young mans marital troubles the knowing editor gave a sufficiently colored account of his career stating the amount of his income and the manner in which he was supposed to spend it
arent you splashed
one of the goulds was getting a divorce and frank took it as a personal affront
we never had so many of them in here before
when emil reached the lower corner by the hedge marie was sitting under her white mulberry tree the pailful of cherries beside her looking off at the gentle tireless swelling of the wheat
she wouldnt know how to go about it
frank read english slowly and the more he read about this divorce case the angrier he grew
we shall have to behave like mr linstrum
i wish you werent so restless and didnt get so worked up over things she said sadly
everything i say makes you cross dont it
emil gripped the hand holds of his scythe and began to mow
do you like mr linstrum marie asked suddenly
im sure alexandra hopes you will stay on here she murmured
im going to pick cherries isnt everything beautiful after the rain
his yellow canvas leggings and khaki trousers were splashed to the knees
he dropped a handful into her lap
do they
marie turned away wringing her hands
i feel as if this tree knows everything i ever think of when i sit here
frank and lou bergson had very similar ideas and they were two of the political agitators of the county
and you never used to be cross to me
when he saw her coming he stopped and wiped his brow
do you think alexandra likes him very much
you dont help things any by pretending
then he went on in a low tone so intense that it was almost threatening sometimes you seem to understand perfectly and then sometimes you pretend you dont
good bye
she looked down at his wet leggings
please leave the roses till last if you must cut them
and there are so many many things i cant do emil echoed her tone sarcastically
i cant pray to have the things i want he said slowly and i wont pray not to have them not if im damned for it
alexandra can run the farm all right without me
i pray for you but thats not the same as if you prayed yourself
well which are the lucky trees id like to know
it would serve you all right if she walked off with carl
if you wont understand you know i could make you
oh you dont know alexandra as well as you think you do
after he was gone marie went out to the back porch to begin her butter making a brisk wind had come up and was driving puffy white clouds across the sky
alexandras never been in love you crazy he laughed again
will you have to cut them too
i never expect to have any more
that invitation decided her
they are always so spicy after a rain
who alexandra emil laughed and thrust his hands into his trousers pockets
she thought it hard that the goulds for whom she had nothing but good will should make her so much trouble
marie took up her cherries and went slowly toward the house crying bitterly
she and i have always been good friends
why is it
marie clasped her hands and started up from her seat
the orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun
youll have to get some other little boy to play with he stopped and took a deep breath
i want to be doing something on my own account
why not
the wind wakened me
she hated to see the sunday newspapers come into the house
marie looked up at his defiant figure and her face clouded
oh emil
if i cut the grass i will emil said teasingly
when she used to tell me about him i always wondered whether she wasnt a little in love with him
he turned to his farm hand who was reading the other half of the paper
if i feel that way i feel that way
emil took a step nearer and stood frowning down at her bent head he stood in an attitude of self defense his feet well apart his hands clenched and drawn up at his sides so that the cords stood out on his bare arms
i dont know all of them but i know lindens are
i get tired of seeing men and horses going up and down up and down
ill call you if i see a snake
what are you talking about marie
thats what you miss marie
i must go somewhere mustnt i
marie shrugged her shoulders
on the evening of the day of alexandras call at the shabatas a heavy rain set in
they were old friends
listen here what he do wit his money and frank began the catalogue of the young mans reputed extravagances
thats so marie sighed
i cant play with you like a little boy any more he said slowly
am i flighty
emil had nothing to say to this
if you had any eyes you would see that she is very fond of him
she ran into the house put on a short skirt and a pair of her husbands boots caught up a tin pail and started for the orchard
dont let me disturb you emil
frank was always reading about the doings of rich people and feeling outraged he had an inexhaustible stock of stories about their crimes and follies how they bribed the courts and shot down their butlers with impunity whenever they chose
oh emil you know what i mean marie tossed her head impatiently does she really care about him
what makes you so flighty
its exciting to see everything growing so fastand to get the grass cut
emil stood defiant gazing down at her
about like the germans wasnt it
marie went on as if she had not heard him
i like trees because they seem more resigned to the way they have to live than other things do
all sorts of weeds and herbs and flowers had grown up there splotches of wild larkspur pale green and white spikes of hoarhound plantations of wild cotton tangles of foxtail and wild wheat
oh ever so much only he seems kind of staid and school teachery but of course he is older than frank even
that summer the rains had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than shabata and his man could do to keep up with the corn the orchard was a neglected wilderness
shes the cunningest little thing i ever saw said mrs whitney enthusiastically afterward aside to mr king
im afraid those wouldnt quite answer the purpose said his mamma smilingespecially the last yet we must think of something
polly sat up very straight and whisked off the tears quickly
what asked phronsie in intense interest slipping down out of pollys arms and crowding up close to jaspers side
and to be sure our pollys face was a study to behold
now youll stay cried van say polly wont you
oh phronsie cried polly turning around at the last words how could you
im here polly
but pollys arms were around the old gentlemans neck so she didnt hear
if she could only see phronsie for just one moment
so i hope said mrs whitney and father i do believe theyll repay you for i do think theres good blood there these children have a look about them that shows them worthy to be trusted
my son said his mamma just stop and think how badly you would feel if you really couldnt see percy
i didnt have any fears if i worked it rightly said the old gentleman complacently
boys whispered their mother warningly she cant answer you just look at her face
oh lets go back was all they heard
well said van and he showed signs of relenting a little at that but percy is perfectly awful mamma you dont know and he feels so smart too he said vindictively
id like it first rate to be away from percy said van reflectively i wouldnt come back in three no six weeks
at this the bundle opened suddenly andout popped phronsie
isnt he splendid cried jasper in intense pride swelling up
but just here mr king thought it about time to take matters into his hands
so you must cried jasper enchanted at his success in amusing and ill go with you
and to think how fond the little girl is of you father said mrs whitney who hadnt yet gotten over her extreme surprise at the old gentlemans complete subjection to the little peppers he whom all children had by instinct always approached so carefully and whom every one found it necessary to conciliate
i know gasped polly controlling her sobs i wontonlyi cant thank you
then dear said mrs whitney you must be kinder to her than ever think what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among friends
arent you glad ive come polly asked phronsie with her little face close to pollys own
there there he said soothingly patting her brown fuzzy head something was going down the old gentlemans neck that wet his collar and made him whisper very tenderly in her ear dont give way now polly phronsiell see you
that brought polly to
to think that phronsie had left her for any oneeven good mr king
where is she said a voice over in front of the piano in the gathering duskunmistakably mr kings
yes it must be confessed
i dont know said van running over in his mind all the possible ways he could think of for entertaining anybody unless shed like my new book of travelsor my velocipede he added
bark
all jaspers frantic efforts at comfort utterly failed
it got to be noticed finally and one and all redoubled their exertions to make everything twice as pleasant as ever
phronsie said jasper quickly what do you suppose prince said the other day
be still said jappy warningly while phronsie stood surveying them all with grave eyes
dear me ejaculated the old gentleman in the utmost amazement and such a time as ive had to get her here too he added staring around on the astonished group none of whom had a word to say
oh she cried coming out of her rapture a little and springing over to mr king with phronsie still in her arms
the only place except in front of the grand piano where polly approached a state of comparative happiness was in the greenhouse
here polly hold your arms he had only strength to gasp
oh she couldnt help it cried mr king beginning to walk up and down the floor and beaming as he recalled his successful strategy there wasnt the smallest use in thinking of anything else
well said mrs whitney softly lets think what we can do for polly it makes me feel very badly to see her sad little face
i wasnt coming without her marian if it could possibly be managed
here she would stay comforted and soothed among the lovely plants and rich exotics rejoicing the heart of old turner the gardener who since pollys first rapturous entrance had taken her into his good graces for all time
every chance she could steal after practice hours were over and after the clamorous demands of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied was seized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers
i cant bear it and over went her head on the music rack
yes all alone by himself asserted jasper vehemently and winking furiously to the others to stop their laughing he did now truly phronsie
werent you awfully surprised cried percy say polly awfully
here im
i shall have to give up she moaned
but the chubby face didnt look up brightly as usual and the next moment without a bit of warning phronsie sprang past them all even polly and flung herself into mr kings arms in a perfect torrent of sobs
oh phronsie she cried and strained her to her heart while the boys crowded around and plied her with sudden questions
but polly stood like a statue
oh ho how funny laughed van while little dick burst right out japser
polly is comforted
somehow of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest this day it seemed as if she could bear it no longer
so her mother was willing asked his daughter curiously
father knew how to do it
but polly couldnt speak and if jasper hadnt caught her just in time she would have tumbled over backward from the stool phronsie and all
yes pretty soon now
is her name phronsie put in dick unwilling to be left out and not thinking of anything else to ask
she must be there now somewhere and then somebody laughed
phronsie said mrs whitney smilingly stooping over the child would you like to see a little pussy i have for you
so you see i was just in time in the very nick of time in fact
well shes a nice child he said a very nice child and straightening himself up to his fullest height and looking so very handsome that his daughter could not conceal her admiration i shall always take care of phronsie pepper marian
at last he came out of them and wiped his face vigorously
so they have so they have assented mr king and then the conversation dropped
so with a great many chucklings and shruggings when no one was by he had departed after breakfast one day simply saying he shouldnt be back to lunch
dont mind it polly whispered jasper twasnt her fault
at night when no one knew it the tears would come racing over the poor forlorn little face and would not be squeezed back
like a scene on some vague arras old as mans weariness the image of the seventh city of christendom was visible to him across the timeless air no older nor more weary nor less patient of subjection than in the days of the thingmote
the clouds were drifting above him silently and silently the seatangle was drifting below him and the grey warm air was still and a new wild life was singing in his veins
duck him
a wild angel had appeared to him the angel of mortal youth and beauty an envoy from the fair courts of life to throw open before him in an instant of ecstasy the gates of all the ways of error and glory
a full hour had passed since his father had gone in with dan crosby the tutor to find out for him something about the university
the university
but he apart from them and in silence remembered in what dread he stood of the mystery of his own body
he recognized their speech collectively before he distinguished their faces
he would create proudly out of the freedom and power of his soul as the great artificer whose name he bore a living thing new and soaring and beautiful impalpable imperishable
words
one
so timeless seemed the grey warm air so fluid and impersonal his own mood that all ages were as one to him
yet her mistrust pricked him more keenly than his fathers pride and he thought coldly how he had watched the faith which was fading down in his soul ageing and strengthening in her eyes
he passed from the trembling bridge on to firm land again
the water of the rivulet was dark with endless drift and mirrored the high drifting clouds
he drew forth a phrase from his treasure and spoke it softly to himself
her slate blue skirts were kilted boldly about her waist and dovetailed behind her
stephanos dedalos
he climbed to the crest of the sandhill and gazed about him
he allowed them to glow and fade hue after hue sunrise gold the russet and green of apple orchards azure of waves the grey fringed fleece of clouds
idle and embittering finally to argue against his own dispassionate certitude that the commandment of love bade us not to love our neighbour as ourselves with the same amount and intensity of love but to love him as ourselves with the same kind of love
he looked northward towards howth
angry with himself he tried to hide his face from their eyes by gazing down sideways into the shallow swirling water under the bridge but he still saw a reflection therein of their top heavy silk hats and humble tape like collars and loosely hanging clerical clothes
one
for a full hour he had paced up and down waiting but he could wait no longer
an ecstasy of flight made radiant his eyes and wild his breath and tremulous and wild and radiant his windswept limbs
guzzle him now towser
he felt above him the vast indifferent dome and the calm processes of the heavenly bodies and the earth beneath him the earth that had borne him had taken him to her breast
the europe they had come from lay out there beyond the irish sea europe of strange tongues and valleyed and woodbegirt and citadelled and of entrenched and marshalled races
help
at that instant as it seemed to him the air was chilled and looking askance towards the water he saw a flying squall darkening and crisping suddenly the tide
what were they now but cerements shaken from the body of deaththe fear he had walked in night and day the incertitude that had ringed him round the shame that had abased him within and withoutcerements the linens of the grave
help
good man towser
his eyelids trembled as if they felt the vast cyclic movement of the earth and her watchers trembled as if they felt the strange light of some new world
emerald and black and russet and olive it moved beneath the current swaying and turning
the pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the dignity of the office he had refused
a world a glimmer or a flower
was it their colours
his soul had arisen from the grave of boyhood spurning her grave clothes
he turned seaward from the road at dollymount and as he passed on to the thin wooden bridge he felt the planks shaking with the tramp of heavily shod feet
their banter was not new to him and now it flattered his mild proud sovereignty
her thighs fuller and soft hued as ivory were bared almost to the hips where the white fringes of her drawers were like feathering of soft white down
the end he had been born to serve yet did not see had led him to escape by an unseen path and now it beckoned to him once more and a new adventure was about to be opened to him
duck him
their bodies corpse white or suffused with a pallid golden light or rawly tanned by the sun gleamed with the wet of the sea their diving stone poised on its rude supports and rocking under their plunges and the rough hewn stones of the sloping breakwater over which they scrambled in their horseplay gleamed with cold wet lustre
look out
he could wait no longer
one
now as never before his strange name seemed to him a prophecy
what hour was it
he turned away from her suddenly and set off across the strand
yes his mother was hostile to the idea as he had read from her listless silence
they were voyaging across the deserts of the sky a host of nomads on the march voyaging high over ireland westward bound
her bosom was as a birds soft and slight slight and soft as the breast of some dark plumaged dove
this was the call of life to his soul not the dull gross voice of the world of duties and despair not the inhuman voice that had called him to the pale service of the altar
their piety would be like their names like their faces like their clothes and it was idle for him to tell himself that their humble and contrite hearts it might be paid a far richer tribute of devotion than his had ever been a gift tenfold more acceptable than his elaborate adoration
he started up nervously from the stone block for he could no longer quench the flame in his blood
he set off abruptly for the bull walking rapidly lest his fathers shrill whistle might call him back and in a few moments he had rounded the curve at the police barrack and was safe
heavenly god cried stephens soul in an outburst of profane joy
in the distance along the course of the slow flowing liffey slender masts flecked the sky and more distant still the dim fabric of the city lay prone in haze
was it a quaint device opening a page of some medieval book of prophecies and symbols a hawk like man flying sunward above the sea a prophecy of the end he had been born to serve and had been following through the mists of childhood and boyhood a symbol of the artist forging anew in his workshop out of the sluggish matter of the earth a new soaring impalpable imperishable being
his soul was swooning into some new world fantastic dim uncertain as under sea traversed by cloudy shapes and beings
bous stephaneforos
how characterless they looked shuley without his deep unbuttoned collar ennis without his scarlet belt with the snaky clasp and connolly without his norfolk coat with the flapless side pockets it was a pain to see them and a sword like pain to see the signs of adolescence that made repellent their pitiable nakedness
perhaps they had taken refuge in number and noise from the secret dread in their souls
his throat ached with a desire to cry aloud the cry of a hawk or eagle on high to cry piercingly of his deliverance to the winds
a faint click at his heart a faint throb in his throat told him once more of how his flesh dreaded the cold infrahuman odour of the sea yet he did not strike across the downs on his left but held straight on along the spine of rocks that pointed against the rivers mouth
all through his boyhood he had mused upon that which he had so often thought to be his destiny and when the moment had come for him to obey the call he had turned aside obeying a wayward instinct
the mere sight of that medley of wet nakedness chilled him to the bone
the towels with which they smacked their bodies were heavy with cold seawater and drenched with cold brine was their matted hair
he stood still in deference to their calls and parried their banter with easy words
their feet passed in pattering tumult over his mind the feet of hares and rabbits the feet of harts and hinds and antelopes until he heard them no more and remembered only a proud cadence from newman
he was unheeded happy and near to the wild heart of life
what did it mean
to live to err to fall to triumph to recreate life out of life
he felt his cheeks aflame and his throat throbbing with song
evening had fallen when he woke and the sand and arid grasses of his bed glowed no longer
it was an elfin prelude endless and formless and as it grew wilder and faster the flames leaping out of time he seemed to hear from under the boughs and grasses wild creatures racing their feet pattering like rain upon the leaves
it was idle for him to move himself to be generous towards them to tell himself that if he ever came to their gates stripped of his pride beaten and in beggars weeds that they would be generous towards him loving him as themselves
her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call
no it was not their colours it was the poise and balance of the period itself
whose feet are as the feet of harts and underneath the everlasting arms
come along dedalus
but her long fair hair was girlish and girlish and touched with the wonder of mortal beauty her face
she was alone and still gazing out to sea and when she felt his presence and the worship of his eyes her eyes turned to him in quiet sufferance of his gaze without shame or wantonness
a dim antagonism gathered force within him and darkened his mind as a cloud against her disloyalty and when it passed cloud like leaving his mind serene and dutiful towards her again he was made aware dimly and without regret of a first noiseless sundering of their lives
an instant of wild flight had delivered him and the cry of triumph which his lips withheld cleft his brain
his heart trembled in an ecstasy of fear and his soul was in flight
a moment before the ghost of the ancient kingdom of the danes had looked forth through the vesture of the hazewrapped city
a squad of christian brothers was on its way back from the bull and had begun to pass two by two across the bridge soon the whole bridge was trembling and resounding
where was his boyhood now
now at the name of the fabulous artificer he seemed to hear the noise of dim waves and to see a winged form flying above the waves and slowly climbing the air
disheartened he raised his eyes towards the slow drifting clouds dappled and seaborne
a veiled sunlight lit up faintly the grey sheet of water where the river was embayed
the music came nearer and he recalled the words the words of shelleys fragment upon the moon wandering companionless pale for weariness
a great saint saint francis xavier
the chaos in which his ardour extinguished itself was a cold indifferent knowledge of himself
but the dusk deepening in the schoolroom covered over his thoughts
a certain pride a certain awe withheld him from offering to god even one prayer at night though he knew it was in gods power to take away his life while he slept and hurl his soul hellward ere he could beg for mercy
the dull light fell more faintly upon the page whereon another equation began to unfold itself slowly and to spread abroad its widening tail it was his own soul going forth to experience unfolding itself sin by sin spreading abroad the bale fire of its burning stars and folding back upon itself fading slowly quenching its own lights and fires they were quenched and the cold darkness filled chaos
thats game ball
the imagery of the psalms of prophecy soothed his barren pride
why was the sacrament of the eucharist instituted under the two species of bread and wine if jesus christ be present body and blood soul and divinity in the bread alone and in the wine alone
he is called as you know the apostle of the indies
a gentle kick from the tall boy in the bench behind urged stephen to ask a difficult question
if ever his soul re entering her dwelling shyly after the frenzy of his bodys lust had spent itself was turned towards her whose emblem is the morning star bright and musical telling of heaven and infusing peace it was when her names were murmured softly by lips whereon there still lingered foul and shameful words the savour itself of a lewd kiss
is that you pigeon
he would follow a devious course up and down the streets circling always nearer and nearer in a tremor of fear and joy until his feet led him suddenly round a dark corner
dont make such a bally racket
stephen leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler listened to the talk about him which heron checked from time to time by saying
the retreat will go on from wednesday to friday
he had the faith in him that moves mountains
i sir
if the wine change into vinegar and the host crumble into corruption after they have been consecrated is jesus christ still present under their species as god and as man
how comes it that while the first beatitude promises the kingdom of heaven to the poor of heart the second beatitude promises also to the meek that they shall possess the land
that was strange
if a layman in giving baptism pour the water before saying the words is the child baptized
on friday confession will be heard all the afternoon after beads
the boy from the house is coming up for the rector
does a tiny particle of the consecrated bread contain all the body and blood of jesus christ or a part only of the body and blood
if a man had stolen a pound in his youth and had used that pound to amass a huge fortune how much was he obliged to give back the pound he had stolen only or the pound together with the compound interest accruing upon it or all his huge fortune
the bell rang the master marked the sums and cuts to be done for the next lesson and went out
we can scut the whole hour
the rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson from
you are all familiar with the story of the life of saint francis xavier i suppose the patron of your college
it is said that his right arm had grown powerless from having been raised so often over the heads of those whom he baptized he wished then to go to china to win still more souls for god but he died of fever on the island of sancian
a little wave of quiet mirth broke forth over the class of boys from the rectors grim smile
why sir
hello bertie any good in your mind
he tried to think how it could be
do you mean to say that you are not able to tell me what a surd is
but saturday and sunday being free days some boys might be inclined to think that monday is a free day also
all the catechisms were opened and all heads bent upon them silently
he stooped to the evil of hypocrisy with others sceptical of their innocence which he could cajole so easily
if ever he was impelled to cast sin from him and to repent the impulse that moved him was the wish to be her knight
towards others he felt neither shame nor fear
at his first violent sin he had felt a wave of vitality pass out of him and had feared to find his body or his soul maimed by the excess
it was strange too that he found an arid pleasure in following up to the end the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church and penetrating into obscure silences only to hear and feel the more deeply his own condemnation
as he sat in his bench gazing calmly at the rectors shrewd harsh face his mind wound itself in and out of the curious questions proposed to it
number ten
mass will be on saturday morning at nine oclock and general communion for the whole college
a great soldier of god
he is said to have baptized as many as ten thousand idolaters in one month
the stars began to crumble and a cloud of fine stardust fell through space
a great fisher of souls
on the wall of his bedroom hung an illuminated scroll the certificate of his prefecture in the college of the sodality of the blessed virgin mary
the equation on the page of his scribbler began to spread out a widening tail eyed and starred like a peacocks and when the eyes and stars of its indices had been eliminated began slowly to fold itself together again
the rector went on gravely
here he is
instead the vital wave had carried him on its bosom out of himself and back again when it receded and no part of body or soul had been maimed but a dark peace had been established between them
coming in to have a short time
yet as he prowled in quest of that call his senses stultified only by his desire would note keenly all that wounded or shamed them his eyes a ring of porter froth on a clothless table or a photograph of two soldiers standing to attention or a gaudy playbill his ears the drawling jargon of greeting
her eyes seemed to regard him with mild pity her holiness a strange light glowing faintly upon her frail flesh did not humiliate the sinner who approached her
his pride in his own sin his loveless awe of god told him that his offence was too grievous to be atoned for in whole or in part by a false homage to the all seeing and all knowing
i think you lawless are likely to make that mistake
at most by an alms given to a beggar whose blessing he fled from he might hope wearily to win for himself some measure of actual grace
the whores would be just coming out of their houses making ready for the night yawning lazily after their sleep and settling the hairpins in their clusters of hair he would pass by them calmly waiting for a sudden movement of his own will or a sudden call to his sin loving soul from their soft perfumed flesh
beware of making that mistake
the falsehood of his position did not pain him
it would be a gloomy secret night
heron beside stephen began to hum tunelessly
good night husband
he hoped there would be stew for dinner turnips and carrots and bruised potatoes and fat mutton pieces to be ladled out in thick peppered flour fattened sauce stuff it into you his belly counselled him
a saint who has great power in heaven remember power to intercede for us in our grief power to obtain whatever we pray for if it be for the good of our souls power above all to obtain for us the grace to repent if we be in sin
a great saint saint francis xavier
if at moments he felt an impulse to rise from his post of honour and confessing before them all his unworthiness to leave the chapel a glance at their faces restrained him
shut up will you
what music
the sentence of saint james which says that he who offends against one commandment becomes guilty of all had seemed to him first a swollen phrase until he had begun to grope in the darkness of his own state
the vast cycle of starry life bore his weary mind outward to its verge and inward to its centre a distant music accompanying him outward and inward
he clasped his hands on the desk and said
he ceased to shake his clasped hands and resting them against his forehead looked right and left of them keenly at his listeners out of his dark stern eyes
what did it avail to pray when he knew that his soul lusted after its own destruction
ennis who had gone to the yard came back saying
ten thousand souls won for god in a single month
devotion had gone by the board
he came of an old and illustrious spanish family and you remember that he was one of the first followers of saint ignatius
a tall boy behind stephen rubbed his hands and said
a boy from his post at the window had seen the rector come from the house
on sunday mornings as he passed the church door he glanced coldly at the worshippers who stood bareheaded four deep outside the church morally present at the mass which they could neither see nor hear their dull piety and the sickly smell of the cheap hair oil with which they had anointed their heads repelled him from the altar they prayed at
fresh nelly is waiting on you
a cold lucid indifference reigned in his soul
he had sinned mortally not once but many times and he knew that while he stood in danger of eternal damnation for the first sin alone by every succeeding sin he multiplied his guilt and his punishment
after early nightfall the yellow lamps would light up here and there the squalid quarter of the brothels
well now ennis i declare you have a head and so has my stick
if any boys have special confessors perhaps it will be better for them not to change
he went from country to country in the east from africa to india from india to japan baptizing the people
stephens heart began slowly to fold and fade with fear like a withering flower
his days and works and thoughts could make no atonement for him the fountains of sanctifying grace having ceased to refresh his soul
it consisted of one small dynamo of a capacity of two hundred and eighty lights of ten cp each and was housed in an unpretentious wooden shed
but his attention was in reality concentrated closely on the supply of great centres of population a task which he then felt might well occupy his lifetime and except in regard to furnishing isolated plants he did not pursue further the development of hydroelectric stations
he felt he was up against it and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better
after the station had been running several months and was technically a success we began to look after the financial part
copper for the circuits was more highly refined than ever before to secure the best conductivity and purity was insisted on in every kind of insulation edison was intolerant of sham and shoddy and nothing would satisfy him that could not stand cross examination by microscope test tube and galvanometer
his electrolytic meter was very successful and was of widespread use in america and in europe until the perfection of mechanical meters by elihu thomson and others brought that type into general acceptance
in this connection it should be mentioned that the association of edison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the edison meter was accurate and that its use was not expensive for stations above one thousand lights and that the best financial results were invariably secured in a station selling current by meter
the street conductors were of the overhead pole line construction and were installed by the construction company that had been organized by edison to build and equip central stations a special type of street pole had been devised by him for the three wire system
a sudden black cloud came up and i telephoned to chinnock and asked him about the load
of course the nights were getting longer
not a single engine was even within gunshot of the standard thus set up but the emergency called forth its man in gardiner c sims a talented draughtsman and designer who had been engaged in locomotive construction and in the engineering department of the united states navy
our first engine compelled the inventing and making of a suitable engine indicator to indicate itthe tabor
the paris plant like that at the crystal palace was a temporary exhibit
the investors in the enterprise were ready and anxious to meet the extra cost of putting the wires underground
then the man called chinnock up
the installation of boilers engines dynamos wiring switches fixtures three stage regulators and six hundred and fifty lamps was completed in eleven days after receipt of the order and the plant was successfully operated at the opening of the theatre on december twelfth eighteen eighty two
this evolution has been quite distinct with its own inventors like gaulard and gibbs and stanley but came subsequent to the work of supplying small dense areas of population the art thus growing from within and using each new gain as a means for further achievement
burbank and his tribe represent in the vegetable world edison in the mechanical
at this time and long after all arc lighting was done on a flat rate basis
this may answer perhaps in a small place where the manager can gauge pretty closely from actual observation what each customer does but even then there are elements of risk and waste and obviously in a large city such a method would soon be likely to result in financial disaster to the plant
they found an engine somewhat loose in the bearings and there followed remarks which would not look well in print
we then went to the dynamo room where i pointed out the machines converting the steam power into electricity appearing later in the form of light in the lamps
meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three wire system known in england as the hopkinson both dr john hopkinson and mr edison being independent inventors at practically the same time
the station at berlin comprised five boilers and six vertical steam engines driving by belts twelve edison dynamos each of about fifty five horse power capacity
the first edison plant in a hotel was started in october eighteen eighty one at the blue mountain house in the adirondacks and consisted of two z dynamos with a complement of eight and sixteen candle lamps
by digging a cheap trench and putting in an insulated cable and connecting such station with the central part of richmond having the end of the cable come up into the station from the earth and there connected with motors the power of the falls would be transmitted to these motors
i said we were sent over to get going and insisted on starting up on the night of the third
with those eight dynamos we had four belts between each engine and the dynamo
it could not be used for electroplating or deposition nor could it charge storage batteries all of which are easily within the ability of the direct current
we had two wire underground feeders sent without any plans or specifications for their installation
it had been stepped on and flattened
nothing happened however to interfere with the successful running of the station and for twenty years thereafter the same two dynamos continued to furnish light in sunbury
they were later used as reserve machines and finally with the engine retired from service as part of the collection of edisonia but they remain in practically as good condition as when installed in eighteen eighty three
soon after the station went into operation this ingenious plan was changed and the third dynamo was replaced by two others
it was literally the beginning of the electrical illumination of american expositions carried later to such splendid displays as those of the chicago worlds fair in eighteen ninety three buffalo in nineteen o one and saint louis in nineteen o four
one ammeter for measuring the quantity of current output was interpolated in the neutral bus or third wire return circuit to indicate when the load on the two machines was out of balance
this new plant takes high tension polyphase current from a water power thirty or forty miles away at paderno on the river adda flowing from the apennines but delivers low tension direct current for distribution to the regular edison three wire system throughout milan
note has already been made of the first edison plants afloat on the jeannette and columbia and the first commercial plant in the new york lithographic establishment
its thin wires can be carried cheaply over vast areas and at each local point of consumption the transformer of size exactly proportioned to its local task takes the high voltage transmission current and lowers its potential at a ratio of twenty or forty to one for use in distribution and consumption circuits
he had been connected with local telephone interests but resigned to take active charge of this plant imbibing quickly the traditional edison spirit working hard all day and sleeping in the station at night on a cot brought there for that purpose
the organization was crude the steam engineering talent poor and owing to the impossibility of getting any considerable capital subscribed the plants were put in as cheaply as possible
the sunbury generating plant consisted of an armington and sims engine driving two small edison dynamos having a total capacity of about four hundred lamps of sixteen cp
we had an armington and sims engine with sight feed oiler
the hotel is situated at an elevation of thirty five hundred feet above the sea and was at that time forty miles from the railroad
there messrs johnson and hammer put into practice many of the ideas now standard in the art and secured much useful data for the work in new york of which the story has just been told
every department of mechanics was stimulated and benefited to an extraordinary degree
hence the edison electrolytic meter is no longer used despite its excellent qualities
the invention is in universal use today alike for direct and for alternating current and as well in the equipment of large buildings as in the distribution system of the most extensive central station networks
among the exhibits of that exposition was the edison system of incandescent lighting
the arc lamp installed outside a customers premises or in a circuit for public street lighting burned so many hours nightly so many nights in the month and was paid for at that rate subject to rebate for hours when the lamp might be out through accident
sunbury was also provided with the first electro chemical meters used in the united states outside new york city so that it served also to accentuate electrical practice in a most vital respectnamely the measurement of the electrical energy supplied to customers
owing to his insistence on low pressure direct current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers edison has been frequently spoken of as an opponent of the alternating current
the first permanent edison station in europe was that at milan italy for which the order was given as early as may eighteen eighty two by an enterprising syndicate
returning to the more specific subject of pioneer plants of importance that at brockton must be considered for a moment chiefly for the reason that the city was the first in the world to possess an edison station distributing current through an underground three wire network of conductorsthe essentially modern contemporaneous practice standard twenty five years later
in the second year we put the stock exchange on the circuits of the station but were very fearful that there would be a combination of heavy demand and a dark day and that there would be an overloaded station
for a six hour run of the plant one quarter of a cord of wood was required at a cost of twenty five cents per cord
he weighed and reweighed the meter plates and pursued every line of investigation imaginable but all in vain
he did so
this does him an injustice
the station had neither voltmeter nor ammeter
the station equipment at brockton consisted at first of three dynamos one of which was so arranged as to supply both sides of the system during light loads by a breakdown switch connection
after that they were shown the meters by which the consumption of current was measured
the first cold day after starting the station people began to come in from their offices especially down in front street and water street saying the meter was on fire
the most interesting feature of this installation was the employment of special deepsea lamps supplied with current through a cable nine hundred and forty feet in length for the purpose of alluring fish
we put many customers on but did not make out many bills
brockton had a good deal of pride in its fine trees and a strong sentiment was very soon aroused against the mutilation proposed so thoughtlessly
the eccentric strap had a round glass oil cup with a brass base that screwed into the strap
i knew chinnock to be square and of good business ability and induced him to leave his job
we were at the machine works goerck street
i believe that this construction department was unkindly named the destruction department it served its purpose never made any money and i had the unpleasant task of presiding at its obsequies
i made him a personal guarantee that if he would take hold of the station and put it on a commercial basis and pay five per cent on six hundred thousand dollars i would give him ten thousand dollars out of my own pocket
that was left to others and to the application of the alternating current which has enabled engineers to harness remote powers and within thoroughly economical limits transmit thousands of horse power as much as two hundred miles at pressures of eighty thousand and one hundred thousand volts
the early arc lamps were rated to require nine to ten amperes of current at forty five volts pressure each receiving which they were estimated to give two thousand cp which was arrived at by adding together the light found at four different positions so that in reality the actual light was about five hundred cp
the meter continued in general service during eighteen ninety nine and probably up to the close of the century
no sir
the standard edison meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the central station company for examination another set being substituted the meter was cheap to manufacture and install and not at all liable to get out of order
we had no means of boring out the field magnets and we cut grooves in them i think the machine is still running nineteen o seven
the difficulty of obtaining engineers in those days to run the highspeed engines three hundred and fifty revolutions per minute is well illustrated by an amusing incident in the very early history of the station
we started to collect some bills but we found that our books were kept badly and that the person in charge who was no business man had neglected that part of it
the theatre was never piped for gas it was also from the brockton central station that current was first supplied to a fire engine houseanother display of remarkably early belief in the trustworthiness of the service under conditions where continuity of lighting was vital
i had never seen one and did not know how it worked with the result that we soon burned up the babbitt metal in the bearings and spent a good part of the night getting them in order
of these two brockton required the larger plant but with the conductors placed underground it was the first to complete its arrangements and close its contract mr henry villard it will be remembered had married the daughter of garrison the famous abolitionist and it was through his relationship with the garrison family that brockton came to have the honor of exemplifying so soon the principles of an entirely new art
i then had a standard made to hold another oil cup so as to see and regulate the drop feed
the heat from this lamp would prevent the liquid from freezing so that the meter could go on doing its duty
when the alternating current was introduced for practical purposes it was not needed for arc lighting the circuit for which from a single dynamo would often be twenty or thirty miles in length its current having a pressure of not less than five or six thousand volts
when it got very cold the metal would contract and close a circuit and throw a lamp into circuit inside the meter
it became the basis of modern heavy current technics the last phrase is italicized as being a happy and authoritative description as well as a tribute
they appeared to be interested and i proceeded to enter upon a comparison of coal made into gas or burned under a boiler to be converted into electricity
thus the art was set going in the united states under many difficulties but with every sign of coming triumph
desiring to put this new system into practical use promptly and receiving applications for licenses from all over the country edison selected brockton massachusetts and sunbury pennsylvania as the two towns for the trial
few of these data were ever actually used however and it was all more or less a matter of guesswork although the central station manager aiming to give good service would naturally see that the dynamos were so operated as to maintain as steadily as possible the normal potential and current
it is true that even down to the present time the flat rate is applied to a great deal of incandescent lighting each lamp being charged for individually according to its probable consumption during each month
the boilers were fired by wood as the economical transportation of coal was a physical impossibility
everything he has done has been aimed at the conservation of energy the contraction of space the intensification of culture
once again he went to the customers meter to look around when a small piece of thick wire on the floor caught his eye the problem was solved
reference has already been made to the work abroad in paris and london
edison was from the first deeply impressed with the possibilities of water power and as this incident shows was prompt to seize such a very early opportunity
we were using coal costing twelve dollars a ton and were paid for our light in currency worth fifty cents on the dollar
they said they were sorrythat is wall street sorryand refused to pay it
the international electrical exposition at paris was intended to place before the eyes of the civilized world the achievements of the century
he obtained the desired speed and load with a friction brake also regulator of speed but waited for an indicator to verify it
for some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against it seriously
the dynamo electric machine though small was robust for under all the varying speeds of water power and the vicissitudes of the plant to which it belonged it continued in active use until eighteen ninety nineseventeen years
a model of this station is preserved in the deutschen museum at munich
when the lights or motors in the circuit are turned on and a certain definite small portion of the current is diverted to flow through the meter from the positive plate to the negative plate the latter increases in weight by receiving a deposit of metallic zinc the positive plate meantime losing in weight by the metal thus carried away from it
i took it up and it had solved the engine oiling problemand my walk to lawrence like a tramp actors was off
in fact he did not know anything about the station anyway so i got the directors to permit me to hire a man to run the station this was mr chinnock who was then superintendent of the metropolitan telephone company of new york
the strong position held by the edison system under the strenuous competition that was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system and it gave an immediate impetus to incandescent lighting
some idea of the confidence inspired by the fame of edison at this period is shown by the fact that the first theatre ever lighted from a central station by incandescent lamps was designed this year and opened in eighteen eighty four at brockton with an equipment of three hundred lamps
the ladies thanked me effusively and brought their visit to a close
mr andrews and i worked in collaboration until the night of the third
having travelled around the world i had cultivated an indifference to any special difficulties of that kind
there was an average cost per lamp for meter operation of twenty two cents a year and each meter took care of an average of seventeen lamps
the london plant was less temporary but not permanent supplying before it was torn out no fewer than three thousand lamps in hotels churches stores and dwellings in the vicinity of holborn viaduct
it went into service august fifteenth eighteen eighty two about three weeks before the pearl street station
one evening there came a sudden flash of fire and a spluttering sizzling noise
the electrical work had to be done in forty eight hours
the edison construction department took entire charge of the installation of the plant and the formal opening was attended on october first eighteen eighty three by mr edison who then remained a week in ceaseless study and consultation over the conditions developed by this initial three wire underground plant
the first mill plant was placed in the woollen factory of james harrison at newburgh new york about september fifteenth eighteen eighty one
andrews skipped from under he obeyed orders i did not
why if we erect a station at the falls it is a great economy to get it up to the city
edison however had satisfied himself that there were various ways of accomplishing the task and had determined that the current should be measured on the premises of every consumer
he did not want his customers to count the heart beats of the engine in the flicker of the lamp
but the plant ran and it was the first three wire station in this country
this arrangement interfered with correct meter registration as the meters on one side of the system registered backward during the hours in which the combination was employed
as a matter of fact the first edison commercial station to be operated in this country was that at appleton wisconsin but its only serious claim to notice is that it was the initial one of the system driven by water power
edison held that the electricity sold must be measured just like gas or water and he proceeded to develop a meter
it was a time of uninterrupted watchfulness
we had an index like a steam gauge called an ampere meter to indicate the amount of current going out
i might remark in this connection that years afterward i applied to the edison electric light company asking them if they would not like to pay me this money as it was spent when i was very hard up and made the company a success and was the foundation of their present prosperity
the jury of awards in presenting four medals to the edison company took occasion to pay a high compliment to the efficiency of the system
i telephoned again and felt something would happen but fortunately it did not
mr sprague realized the trouble quickly threw off the current and stopped the engine
to prevent these electrolytes from freezing we had in each meter a strip of metal
i requested him to make a sheet brass oil cup and solder it to the base i had
about that time mr andrews and i came together
the machinery was taken up in pieces on the backs of mules from the foot of the mountain
it has been thought by many that the magnificent success of this plant did more to stimulate the growth of the incandescent lighting business than any other event in the history of the edison company
on july fourth the sunbury plant was put into commercial operation by edison and he remained a week studying its conditions and watching for any unforeseen difficulty that might arise
this pioneer system was operated continuously until february ninth nineteen hundred or for a period of about seventeen years when the sturdy old machines still in excellent condition were put out of service so that a larger plant could be installed to meet the demand
it was at this central station that lieutenant sprague began his historic work on the electric motor and here that another distinguished engineer and inventor mr h ward leonard installed the meters and became meter man in order that he might study in every intimate detail the improvements and refinements necessary in that branch of the industry
his swoop became a demonstration merely an expression of his rage at having his prey thus snatched from his beak with one short shrill cry of anger he swerved off and sailed upward over the river
for all the splendor of his plumage the merganser was not conspicuous where he sat
but the hawk was already close upon him
the duck was a handsome male of the red breasted merganser family and the absorbing interest of his life was fish
but the antic forest fates wearied of the simple routine of the wilderness had decreed an altogether novel intervention and were giggling in their cloaks of ancient moss
but behind him overtaking him inexorably came the shape that stood for doom itself in the eyes of all his tribethe dreadful blue falcon or duck hawk
he would have been drowned the breath battered clean out of him in half a minute more had he maintained the hopelessly unequal struggle
close ahead of him now the teal saw refugethe flashing line of the rapids
a pounce and the great cat had her paw upon it and crouched snarling up at the hawk
a few yards further on the torrent fell seething over a long ledge into a pool of brief quiet
the pool was perhaps a hundred yards in length
here he proceeded to swallow his prize head first
just about this time in the clear blue overhead a green winged teal was beating his way above the treetops making for the stream with the fear of death at his heart
the hawk embittered by the loss of his first quarry had become as dogged in pursuit as a weasel not to be shaken off or evaded or deceived
but wisdom came to him just in time and he did not strike home
he had no rending claws
once more he half emerged filled his gasping lungs and pounded onward desperately half flying and half swimming
the fisher in the chutes
like his unfortunate little cousin the teal he too had felt the fear of death smitten into his heart and was heading desperately for the refuge of some dark overhanging bank deep fringed with weeds where the dreadful eye of the hawk should not discern him
but water was all they clutched
the teals wings throbbing with a swift short vibration whistled shrilly in the still air so that a prowling wildcat by the waterside heard the sound even above the dull roar of the rapids and glared upward alertly
the hawk sat upon the branch and watched his quarry swimming beneath the surface
in despair he hurled himself downward too soon
the rapids were foam white or golden ruddy or deep shining green brown under the sharp and patchy sunlight and they were sown thickly with wet black rocks here and there glinting with purple
it was a mongrel method of progression in which he was singularly expert
just as he made his cast he saw the fleeing drake and the pursuing hawk come round the bend
had he taken such a prize he could not have profited by it having no means of tearing it to pieces
he dived and caught it came to the surface and swallowed it much refreshed he looked about him
then the leader parted from the line
the great hawk followed hurriedly to retrieve his prey from the ground
immediately over his outstretched gleaming head flew the hawk
the drag upon his beak and the light check upon his wings were inexplicable to him and appalling
he rose noisily into the air made a detour over the tree tops to avoid the fisherman and flew back to his dead branch overhanging the amber rush of the chutes
at the sudden sharp sting of it the great bird turned his head and noticed for the first time the fisherman standing on the bank
at the same moment he felt the light restraint of the almost invisible leader upon his wings where the other two flies had affixed themselves
as it chanced however the victim came down with a thud almost beneath the whiskered nose of the wildcat
his beak with its keen toothed edges was a formidable weapon by means of which he could doubtless have captured disabled and dragged to shore even a fish of a pound or so in weight
the hawk followed his wing tips now almost brushing the water
his feet were red his long narrow beak with its saw toothed edges and sharp hooked tip was bright red
the fisher of the chutes meanwhile was swimming straight downstream for the broken water
the drake unrealizing that the dreadful chase was done sped onward beneath the surface till he could go without breath no longer
with only head and wings above the mad smother he flapped onward frantically beating down the foam about him
the odds however were now laid heavily against the fugitive
he saw the frantic fugitive dive over the ledge and disappear
where the waves for an instant sank they came closerbut not quite within grasping reach
the merganser had a crested head of iridescent green black a broad collar of lustrous white black back black and white wings white belly sides finely pencilled in black and white and a breast of rich chestnut red streaked with black
moreover he was not in the situation or the surroundings which one is wont to associate with ducks
straightway the hawk glided from his perch and darted after him
the cat growled softly picked up the prize in her jaws and trotted into the bushes to devour it
almost instantly he was forced to the top
the rapids would presently come to an end
it directly overhung a transparent amber brown chute of unbroken water in the midst of the loud turmoil of north fork rapids
he had three flies on his cast and because in these waters there was always the chance of hooking a grilse he was using heavy tackle
for a moment the fisherman bewildered tried to play him like a salmon
here where the north fork stream fell into the ottanoonsis was a resort exactly to his liking
for all its appalling speed the sound of his flight was nothing more than a strong pulsating hiss
happily for him he on his part caught sight of the hawk and dropped like lead into the torrent
the drake was suspicious of men though he did not greatly fear them as he and his rank fleshed tribe were not interesting to the hunters
it was not in the quiet pools and long deep reaches of dark water that he loved to seek his prey but rather to snatch it from the grasp of the loud chutes and the roaring rips
then he came up among some arrowweeds lifted his head beneath the shelter of one of the broad barbed leaves and floated there quivering
the marauder from the upper air was waiting till his quarry should reach less turbulent waters
and most of the fishtrout salmon grilse or parrwhich journeyed up and down either the fork or the parent river chose to pass through that sluice of swift but unbroken flow immediately beneath the overhanging branch on which he perched
he tried to check his cast but it was too late
the hawk alighted on the dead branch and sat upright motionless as if surprised
there was no such thing as a hawk in sight
immediately beyond the lip of the ledge the hawk lifted his wings high over his back and struck downward so that his talons went deep into the water
but suddenly straight and swift as a diving cormorant he shot down into the torrent and disappeared beneath the surface
he was too imposing in appearance too gorgeous in apparel too bold and vigilant in demeanor to be so misunderstood
a watcher directly overhead escaping the baffling reflections might have seen him swimming head outstretched mastering the tremendous rush of the stream with mighty strokes fairly out speeding the fish in their own element near the limit of the clear water he overtook and seized the quarry which he had markeda trout not far from seven inches in length
for a good ten minutes he waited moveless with the patience of the wild things then his terror faded appetite once more began to invite his attention and he took note of a minnow flickering slowly over the sun flecked mud below him
but as before the leaping waves of the rapids were too much for his pursuer and he was able to flap his way onward in a cloud of foam while doom hung low above his head yet hesitated to strike
his flies as befitted these amber brown tumultuous northern streams were large and conspicuousa parmacheenie belle for the tail fly with a montreal and a red hackle for the drops
the drake sank again instantly
the wily drake had plunged with the plunge of the fall itself and was now darting onward at a safe depth
as long as his body was completely submerged it was at the mercy of the twisting and tortured currents which rolled him over and over in spite of his swimming craft
he saw the great hawk swoop savagely
he was plainly a duck
then in the still water unless he should chance upon a hiding place the drake would soon be forced to come to the top for breath and those throttling talons would instantly close upon his neck
the last drop fly as luck would have it caught just in the corner of the hawks angrily open beak hooking itself firmly
this branch was thrust out very obligingly in just the place where this most singular of ducks would have desired it if it had been consulted in the matter
the fisherman reeled in the limp coils and the worried hawk flew off with the flies
in fact he had just finished itthe last of the trouts tail had just vanished with a spasm down his strained gulletwhen the baffled hawk caught sight of him and swooped
it was enough however and the unhappy teal was hurled earthward flapping through the tips of the branches
the spot where all this happened was perhaps a hundred yards below that dead tree upon whose outthrust naked branch the splendid merganser drake was making his meal
in every line and hue he was unmistakably an aristocrat among ducks and an arrogant one at that
but here he was at a terrible disadvantage as compared with the owls hawks and eagles
in fact after the fashion of a cormorant or a kingfisher he was perched motionless on a big dead stub of a branch
now the object of this soliloquy is plain
and so on till you get to the end when ophelia might say ah yes or something non committal of that sort
what is it
stagecraft is the art of getting over these and other difficulties and if possible getting over them in a showy manner so that people will say how remarkable his stagecraft is for so young a writer when otherwise they mightnt have noticed it at all
but even the unsuccessful dramatist has his moments
a stage meal is popular because it proves to the audience that the actors even when called charles hawtrey or owen nares are real people just like you and me
this is how it should go
do play it again
how shall this success be achieved
lend me your ear for ten minutes and you shall learn just what stagecraft is and i should begin with a short homily on
how shall i do itwell i couldnt help you
let your actors have tea by all means but see that it is a properly histrionic tea
which strikes me as rather sweet and natural
arthur
no beb e
the obvious answer that the firm which is mentioned in the programme as supplying his trousers would be annoyed if he didnt is not enough nor is it enough to say that the whole plot of the piece hinges on him and that without him the drama would languish
the etiquette is to have two bites before the butler and the three footmen whisk away the plate
well i see i must tell you
if that be so he must explain it
and so on in the same vein for some thirty lines
a cynic is a man who etc
sugar
let us assume further that you wish lord john to reply a cynic is a man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing
quite one of my favourites
how do you do
then is the time to introduce a meal on the stage
what then is to be done
what you want is to make it clear that you are conveying hamlets thoughts to the audience in rather a clever manner
no thanks
was it only a coincidence
the complete dramatist
tea please matthews
frankly i cannot always say
most of the characters seem to be on the stage and for once we do not ask how they got there
if you ever read your shakespeareand no dramatist should despise the works of another dramatist he may always pick up something in them which may be useful for his next playif you ever read your shakespeare it is possible that you have come across this passage
the successful playwright is indeed a man to be envied leaving aside for the moment the question of super tax the prizes which fall to his lot are worth something of an effort
can you give me a few hintssuppose you spoke to me like this then i could do something for you
let us assume that lord arthur asks lord john what a cynic isthe question of what a cynic is having arisen quite naturally in the course of the plot
i want double nine two threesorry
tea is the most usual meal on the stage for the reason that it is the least expensive the property lump of sugar being dusted and used again on the next night
soliloquy
these few remarks are called a soliloquy being addressed rather to the world in general than to any particular person on the stage
my dear sir i should reply or madam you have come to the right shop
whatever
so the soliloquy came into being
but it is the cigarette which chiefly has brought the modern drama to its present state of perfection
once more
there are ways of shifting the eyebrows distending the nostrils and exploring the lower molars with the tongue by which it is possible to denote respectively surprise defiance and doubt
is that you exchange
thank you
without the stage cigarette many an epigram would pass unnoticed many an actors hands would be much more noticeable and the man who works the fireproof safety curtain would lose even the small amount of excitement which at present attaches to his job
why did lord arthur fluffinose enter
the only thing is i dont know anything about technique and stagecraft and the three unities and that sort of rot
you will never be a dramatist until you have learnt the technique of
in short he becomes a prominent figure in london societyand if he is not careful somebody will say so
you see how effective it is
you will of course appreciate that the unfinished sentences not only save time but also make the manoeuvring very much more natural
well there are more ways than one and now we come to what is meant by stagecraft
besides the thing is coming back again as chicken directly
larkspur
yes mlady
exits and entrances
could anything be more natural
let us to give an example of how this method works go back again to the play we have been discussing
it was an unsatisfying life and when rash acquaintances asked him what he did he used to say that he was for the bar
but suppose you said im fond of writing my people always say my letters home are good enough for punch ive got a little idea for a play about a man and a woman and another woman andbut perhaps id better keep the plot a secret for the moment
now this answer even if it comes quite fresh to the stalls will lose much of its effect if it is said without the assistance of a cigarette
it makes a different thing of it altogether
to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler
of course a really good actor can often give a clue to the feelings of a character simply by facial expression
it has been said before but you may feel that it is quite time it was said again besides for all the audience knows lord john may simply be quoting
good bye so glad you could come
hamlet speaking
to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrowswhat no hamlet speaking
a cynic is a man who etc
charming
it is to let hamlet if that happen to be the name of your character enter with a small dog pet falcon mongoose tame bear or whatever animal is most in keeping with the part and confide in this animal such sorrows hopes or secret history as the audience has got to know
this would be an easy way of doing it but it would not be the best way for the reason that it is too easy to call attention to itself
now although it is possible in the case of a few men at the top of the profession to leave the conduct of the cigarette entirely to the actor you will find it much more satisfactory to insert in the stage directions the particular movements with match and so forth that you wish carried out
then the curtain rises and it is apparent that we are assisting at an at home of considerable splendour
yes thats right
the answer to this will depend upon the length of the play for upon the length depends the hour at which the curtain rises
and so on
you will see this for yourself if you consider the passage as it should properly have been written
meals
